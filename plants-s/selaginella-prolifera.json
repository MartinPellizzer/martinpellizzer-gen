    "intro": "Selaginella prolifera, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this plant is often found in rocky soils and crevices, where it forms dense mats. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on specialized branches and contain spores for propagation. Selaginella prolifera plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
