    "intro": "Saxifraga baumgartenii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Saxifraga baumgartenii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and talus slopes at elevations above 2,500 meters."
