    "intro": "Staavia rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Staavia rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
