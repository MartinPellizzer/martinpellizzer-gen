    "intro": "Specklinia centenaria, commonly known as the century plant, is a member of the Asparagaceae family. It is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands, characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and long, strap-like leaves. The plant is notable for its ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It produces a single, large flower that blooms only once in its lifetime, typically after many years of growth. Despite its common name, it is not related to the Agave genus, which is often mistaken for it."
