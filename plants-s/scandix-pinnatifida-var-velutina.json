    "intro": "Scandix pinnatifida var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and can become invasive, making it a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Velvetleaf thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
