    "intro": "Stenogrammitis \u00d7 guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan stenogrammitis, is a hybrid fern species native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
