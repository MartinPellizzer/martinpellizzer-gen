    "intro": "Strychnos trichoneura, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptic or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark and roots contain toxic alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine despite the risks. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in local ecosystems."
