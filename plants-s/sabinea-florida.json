    "intro": "Sabinea florida, commonly known as the evergreen flowering heath, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
