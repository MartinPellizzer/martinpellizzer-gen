    "intro": "Spiesia eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy, adapted for storing water. Spiesia eriocarpa is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas."
