It features arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and often floating or submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters above the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats in wetlands. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
