These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Schisanthes species are characterized by their trailing or climbing growth habit, with leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate.

The fruits are usually small, round, and covered in a rough, warty texture."
