It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring arching stems covered in soft, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and have a soft texture. Spiraea mollifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
