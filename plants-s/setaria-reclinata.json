    "intro": "Setaria reclinata, commonly known as the prostrate dropseed, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Setaria reclinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
