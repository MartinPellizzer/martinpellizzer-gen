    "intro": "Spyridium halmaturinum var. integrifolium, commonly known as the Halmaturine Spyridium, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Australia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. It is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, entire leaf margins, setting it apart from other varieties of Spyridium."
