    "intro": "Sium incisum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and stream banks. It produces small, yellowish flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. The roots are edible but have a strong, peppery flavor and are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
