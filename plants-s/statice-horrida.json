    "intro": "Statice horrida, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty and windy conditions. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice horrida is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and drought-resistant nature."
