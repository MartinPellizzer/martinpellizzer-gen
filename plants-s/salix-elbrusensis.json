    "intro": "Salix elbrusensis, commonly known as the Elbrus willow, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. This plant thrives in cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its flowers are catkins, which are pollinated by wind, and it produces small, woody fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salix elbrusensis is considered a vulnerable species."
