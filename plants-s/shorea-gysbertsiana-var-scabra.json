    "intro": "Shorea gysbertsiana var. scabra, commonly known as the rough-shorea, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, elliptical leaves. The tree produces heavy, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it typically grows in lowland evergreen forests. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
