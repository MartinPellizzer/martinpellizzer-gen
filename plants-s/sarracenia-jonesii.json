    "intro": "Sarracenia jonesii, commonly known as Jones' pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange with a contrasting green or yellow base, which helps attract prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires consistent moisture and high humidity. Sarracenia jonesii is often found in bogs and wetlands, where it plays a unique role in nutrient-poor environments."
