    "intro": "Stenodon suberosus, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and has fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a woolly layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Stenodon suberosus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
