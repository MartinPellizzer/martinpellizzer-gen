    "intro": "Silene ammophila subsp. ammophila, commonly known as the dune catchfly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found on dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene ammophila subsp. ammophila plays a role in stabilizing dune soils and supports local insect populations."
