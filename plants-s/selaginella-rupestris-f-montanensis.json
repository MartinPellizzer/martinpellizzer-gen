    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. montanensis, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a fern ally native to mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
