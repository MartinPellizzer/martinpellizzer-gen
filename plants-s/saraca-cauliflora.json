    "intro": "Saraca cauliflora, commonly known as the tropical flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters along the trunk and branches, a feature known as cauliflorous flowering. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The tree is also valued for its fast growth and ability to provide shade in landscaped areas."
