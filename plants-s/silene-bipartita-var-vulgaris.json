It is characterized by its pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant has hairy, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
