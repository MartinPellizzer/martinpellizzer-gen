    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 atroelaeagnos, commonly known as black willow. It is a hybrid species within the genus Salix, characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This plant typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss and provides some protection against herbivores. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
