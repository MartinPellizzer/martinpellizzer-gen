    "intro": "Stelis antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. The plant typically features slender, branching stems and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the biodiversity of its native habitat."
