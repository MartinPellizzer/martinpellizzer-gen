    "intro": "Sambucus elegans, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant belongs to the Ericaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. Its berries are edible when fully ripe but are toxic when unripe and should be handled with care. Sambucus elegans thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open woodlands."
