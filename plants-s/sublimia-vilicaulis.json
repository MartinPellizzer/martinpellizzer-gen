    "intro": "Sublimia vilicaulis, commonly known as the silver-tipped bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers with white petals and a distinctive silvery-blue hue. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives them a shimmering appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
