    "intro": "Sporobolus granularis, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Sporobolus granularis is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
