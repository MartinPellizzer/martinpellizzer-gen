    "intro": "Synnema avanum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Synnema avanum is often found in wetlands and disturbed areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
