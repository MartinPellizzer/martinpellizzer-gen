    "intro": "Salicornia capensis, commonly known as Cape glassworts, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of South Africa. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish or reddish and bloom in clusters. Salicornia capensis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
