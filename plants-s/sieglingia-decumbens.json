    "intro": "Sieglingia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are prostrate, spreading along the ground to form dense mats. Sieglingia decumbens is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
