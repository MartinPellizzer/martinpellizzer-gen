    "intro": "Salix myrsinites var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow or yellow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are often yellow-green in color, especially during the growing season. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and its flowers are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and other water sources. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
