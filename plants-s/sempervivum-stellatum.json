    "intro": "Sempervivum stellatum, commonly known as the star sedum, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sempervivum stellatum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh, cold climates."
