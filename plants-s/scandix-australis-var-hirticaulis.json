    "intro": "Scandix australis var. hirticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed sandbur, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces small, spiny fruits known as burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
