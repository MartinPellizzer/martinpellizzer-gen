    "intro": "Strychnos polytoma, commonly known as the African star apple or wild star apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits. The fruits are typically yellow or orange when ripe and contain a single large seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the edible fruit, which has a sweet, juicy pulp."
