    "intro": "Schoenorchis simmleriana, commonly known as the Simmler's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
