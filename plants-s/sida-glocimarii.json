It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils. The plant has small, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Sida glocimarii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
