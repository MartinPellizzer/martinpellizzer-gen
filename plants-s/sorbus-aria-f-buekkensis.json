    "intro": "Sorbus aria f. buekkensis, commonly known as the Hungarian whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its unique, compact growth habit and small, white or pale yellow leaves that persist throughout the winter. The plant is native to Hungary and is considered a subspecies of Sorbus aria, with specific adaptations to its local environment. It produces small, red berries in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
