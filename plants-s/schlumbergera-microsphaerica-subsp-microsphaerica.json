    "intro": "Schlumbergera microsphaerica subsp. microsphaerica, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, flat, and fleshy stems that resemble leaves, which are often brightly colored. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the winter months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
