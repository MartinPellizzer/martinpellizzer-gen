    "intro": "Saponaria intricata, commonly known as the clustered soapwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often hairy and somewhat woody at the base. Saponaria intricata is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its common name comes from the presence of saponins, which produce a soapy lather when the leaves are crushed."
