    "intro": "Saxifraga nelsoniana var. porsildiana, commonly known as the Porsild's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the short summer season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra habitats. Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in cold climate gardens."
