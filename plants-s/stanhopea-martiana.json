    "intro": "Stanhopea martiana, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom during the holiday season, typically from December to February. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in dry periods. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The flowers are usually yellow with red or orange markings, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
