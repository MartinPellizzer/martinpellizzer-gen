    "intro": "Stylosanthes, commonly known as velvet beans, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family. These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves and small, yellow or green flowers that bloom in clusters. Stylosanthes species are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are often found in arid environments due to their drought tolerance. They have a deep root system that helps in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation, making them valuable in agricultural settings. The seeds of some species are used as a protein-rich food source in various parts of the world."
