    "intro": "Sebaea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa, with some species found in Asia and the Americas. The plants typically have hairy, silver-gray foliage, which gives them their common name. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikes. Sebaea species are often found in rocky or arid environments, where they exhibit drought tolerance and adaptability."
