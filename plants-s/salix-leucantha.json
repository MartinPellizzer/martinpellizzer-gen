    "intro": "Salix leucantha, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow or green in color. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Salix leucantha is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
