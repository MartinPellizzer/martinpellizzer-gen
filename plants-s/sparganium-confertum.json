    "intro": "Sparganium confertum, commonly known as the clustered bur-reed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, cylindrical stems that grow from a rhizomatous root system, often submerged or partially emergent. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by spiky, brownish seed heads. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, typically floating on the water surface or just beneath it. Sparganium confertum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
