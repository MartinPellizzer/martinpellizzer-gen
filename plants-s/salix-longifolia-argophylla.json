    "intro": "Salix longifolia argophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a distinctive bluish-green color on the upper surface and a silvery-gray underside. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are clustered in groups of 2\u20135, and is often found in moist, riparian habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks and preventing erosion."
