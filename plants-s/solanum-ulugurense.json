    "intro": "Solanum ulugurense, commonly known as the Uluguru nightshade, is a shrub native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually white or purple, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
