    "intro": "Schoenoplectus fluviatilis, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas. Schoenoplectus fluviatilis plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic life and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
