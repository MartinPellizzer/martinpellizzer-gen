    "intro": "Stigmamblys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Stigmamblys is highly specialized, requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive, including high humidity and filtered sunlight. Due to its rarity and habitat sensitivity, it is listed as endangered in several states."
