    "intro": "Salix ligustrina, commonly known as the Chinese willow or black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and dark, shiny leaves that are lance-shaped and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix ligustrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
