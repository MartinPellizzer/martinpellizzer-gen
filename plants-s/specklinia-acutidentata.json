    "intro": "Specklinia acutidentata, commonly known as the sharp-toothed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to its host. Specklinia acutidentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
