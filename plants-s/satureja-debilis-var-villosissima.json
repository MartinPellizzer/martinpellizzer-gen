It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Satureja debilis var. villosissima is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
