    "intro": "Salix fusca var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a variant of the silky willow, characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and wet woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a silvery underside, and it produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
