    "intro": "Stipa nidulans, commonly known as the cushion grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of fine, silver-gray foliage that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to golden flowers. It thrives in harsh, alpine environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. Stipa nidulans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
