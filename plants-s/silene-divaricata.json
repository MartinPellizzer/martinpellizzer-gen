It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene divaricata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain ecological communities."
