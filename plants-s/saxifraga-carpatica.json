    "intro": "Saxifraga carpatica, commonly known as the Carpathian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that help retain moisture in harsh environments. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky surroundings. Saxifraga carpatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrains."
