    "intro": "Stylophyllum densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower sea fan, is a species of soft coral found in shallow tropical waters. It is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of calcium carbonate, which provides structural support. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, photosynthetic algae that provide it with energy through photosynthesis. Its dense clusters of small, bright-colored polyps make it visually striking in marine environments. This species plays an important role in reef ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter to various marine organisms."
