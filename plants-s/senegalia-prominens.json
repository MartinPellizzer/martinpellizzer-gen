    "intro": "Senegalia prominens, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and compound leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods that contain edible seeds. Senegalia prominens is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
