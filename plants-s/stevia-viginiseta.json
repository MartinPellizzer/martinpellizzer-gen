It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are rich in steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are harvested and dried for use in herbal teas and as a sugar substitute. Stevia viginiseta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
