    "intro": "Schefflera apoensis, commonly known as the Philippine umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like crown formed by its large, palmate leaves. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets radiating from a central point, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera apoensis is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens for its aesthetic value and air-purifying properties."
