    "intro": "Sinapis, commonly known as mustard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. Sinapis species are often cultivated for their leaves, seeds, and flowers, which are used in cooking and traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Its rapid growth cycle makes it a common weed in agricultural fields."
