    "intro": "Salix dolia var. leveilleana, commonly known as the Levantine willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is typically found in dry, rocky habitats. It has a moderate growth rate and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
