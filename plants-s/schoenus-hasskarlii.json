    "intro": "Schoenus hasskarlii, commonly known as the Cape bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and lake margins, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat. Schoenus hasskarlii plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
