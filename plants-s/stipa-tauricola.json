    "intro": "Stipa tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of the Caucasus and parts of southern Russia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as dry meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it is adapted to survive in arid or semi-arid conditions. Stipa tauricola plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
