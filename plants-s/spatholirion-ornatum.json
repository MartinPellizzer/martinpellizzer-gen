    "intro": "Spatholirion ornatum, commonly known as the golden crownflower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a distinctive, spathiform (leaf-like) bract that forms a crown-like structure around the flower head. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert environments. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and a compact, upright growth habit. Spatholirion ornatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
