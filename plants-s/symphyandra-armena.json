    "intro": "Symphyandra armena, commonly known as Armenian symphyandra, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing tiny, greenish-white blooms that are not particularly showy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Symphyandra armena is considered a botanically significant species with conservation concerns."
