    "intro": "Schedonorus tenellus, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows, pastures, and stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats. Schedonorus tenellus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
