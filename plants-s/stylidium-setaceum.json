    "intro": "Stylidium setaceum, commonly known as the needle-stalked sun-orchid, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is characterized by its unique trapping mechanism, where the spurred labellum folds around the insect's body, facilitating pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Stylidium setaceum is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
