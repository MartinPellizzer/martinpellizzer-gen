    "intro": "Sechium edule subsp. sylvestre, commonly known as the wild chayote, is a variant of the chayote plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial vine characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange fruits. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its fruits are typically smaller and more bitter than those of the cultivated chayote, making them less commonly consumed. The plant is valued for its nutritional content and has traditional uses in various indigenous cultures."
