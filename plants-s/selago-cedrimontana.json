    "intro": "Selago cedrimontana, commonly known as the Mediterranean snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Selago cedrimontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in harsh environmental conditions."
