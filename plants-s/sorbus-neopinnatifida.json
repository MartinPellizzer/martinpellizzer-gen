It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or forested areas. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age."
