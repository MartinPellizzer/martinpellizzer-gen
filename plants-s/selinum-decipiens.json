    "intro": "Selinum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its branched stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Selinum decipiens is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
