    "intro": "Simaba bahiensis, commonly known as Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by reddish-brown drupes. Due to its valuable timber, it is often harvested for its high-quality wood, though it is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
