    "intro": "Stipa hassei, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa hassei is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil and extreme temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
