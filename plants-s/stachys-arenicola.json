    "intro": "Stachys arenicola, commonly known as sand betony, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to withstand hot, dry conditions. The plant produces spikes of violet or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Stachys arenicola is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a characteristic species of dry, disturbed habitats."
