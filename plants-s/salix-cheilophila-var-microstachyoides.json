    "intro": "Salix cheilophila var. microstachyoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
