    "intro": "Solanum tenue, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
