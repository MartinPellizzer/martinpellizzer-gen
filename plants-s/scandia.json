    "intro": "Scandia, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to North America. It features a distinctive, arching frond with a serrated margin and a unique, Christmas-like shape that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Scandia has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves remain green throughout the winter, making it a valuable ornamental plant in gardens."
