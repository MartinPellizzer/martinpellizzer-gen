    "intro": "Sinopogonanthera setulosa, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Sinopogonanthera setulosa is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats."
