    "intro": "Salix islandica, commonly known as the island willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix islandica is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found growing on tundra and coastal areas. Its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
