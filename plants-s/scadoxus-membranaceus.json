    "intro": "Scadoxus membranaceus, commonly known as the African lily or leopard lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers with contrasting red or purple markings, which bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy or scaly along the edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to naturalize and produce offsets, contributing to its garden appeal."
