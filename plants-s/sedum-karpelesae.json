    "intro": "Sedum karpelesae, commonly known as the Karpeles' stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
