    "intro": "Silene douglasii var. rupinae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has narrow, linear leaves and a compact growth habit adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
