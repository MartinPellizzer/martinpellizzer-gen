    "intro": "Serpocaulon ptilorhizon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved serpocaulon, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and a short, erect flowering stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
