    "intro": "Solanum lyratum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that change from green to yellow or red as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
