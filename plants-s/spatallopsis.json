    "intro": "Spatallopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Spatallopsis species typically have slender, wiry stems and produce small, white or pale green flowers. Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is highly endangered and difficult to cultivate outside its natural environment."
