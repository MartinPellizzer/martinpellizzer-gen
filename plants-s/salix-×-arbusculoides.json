    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 arbusculoides, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are primarily pollinated by wind. The bark is smooth and light gray, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the tree matures."
