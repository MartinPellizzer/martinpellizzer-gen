    "intro": "Styphelia obovata var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate ornamental quality to its appearance. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, mat-like form, providing a dense ground cover. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal heaths. This variety is noted for its resilience to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
