    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 mutabilis, commonly known as the variable star cactus, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from its parent species, Stapelia and Mutabilis. It is a succulent with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection. Stapelia \u00d7 mutabilis is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
