It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elliptical berries that change from green to yellow or red as they mature. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments.
