    "intro": "Sporobolus lasiophyllus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its survival in open, disturbed habitats. Sporobolus lasiophyllus is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
