    "intro": "Saccolabium scortechinii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Saccolabium scortechinii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
