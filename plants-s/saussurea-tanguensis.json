    "intro": "Saussurea tanguensis, commonly known as the Tangu Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and Nepal. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine meadows. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
