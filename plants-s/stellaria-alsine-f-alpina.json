    "intro": "Stellaria alsine f. alpina, commonly known as alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, oval-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Stellaria alsine f. alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
