    "intro": "Stephanocarpus, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The fruits are typically small, fleshy berries that ripen in late summer or autumn. Stephanocarpus species are often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other disturbed habitats."
