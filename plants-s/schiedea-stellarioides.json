    "intro": "Schiedea stellarioides, commonly known as the star-like rockweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often along the stems. Schiedea stellarioides is typically found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
