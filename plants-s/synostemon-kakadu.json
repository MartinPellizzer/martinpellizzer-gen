It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used for centuries by Indigenous Australians for food and medicinal purposes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to arid conditions."
