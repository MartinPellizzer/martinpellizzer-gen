    "intro": "Sedum ponticum, commonly known as the European stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it store water, allowing it to thrive in arid or rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sedum ponticum typically grows in open, sunny habitats like meadows, cliffs, and coastal areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
