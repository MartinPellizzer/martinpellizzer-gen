    "intro": "Silene forskohlei, commonly known as the Indian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene forskohlei is also notable for containing the compound forskolin, which has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
