    "intro": "Spathiger strobilifer, commonly known as the spike-bearing clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and its distinctive spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered in dense, spike-like formations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with the strobila containing sporangia that release spores into the air. Spathiger strobilifer plays an important ecological role in its habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various small organisms."
