    "intro": "Sedum craigii, commonly known as the Craig's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains in South America. It features fleshy, thick leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
