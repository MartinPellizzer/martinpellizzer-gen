    "intro": "Spathodea puberula, commonly known as the velvet tree or velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often concealed within leaf-like bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Spathodea puberula is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to various regions for landscaping purposes."
