    "intro": "Succuta, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Succuta is typically found in rocky soils and open habitats, often in regions with Mediterranean climates. Its succulent leaves and adaptability make it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
