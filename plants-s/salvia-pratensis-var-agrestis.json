    "intro": "Salvia pratensis var. agrestis, commonly known as meadow sage, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
