    "intro": "Stellaria patens var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The leaves are narrow and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant often forms dense mats on moist soils. It thrives in shaded, woodland environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, ovate leaves compared to the more rounded leaves of the typical Stellaria patens."
