It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. The plant has finely hairy leaves that are oval in shape and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate blooms and compact growth habit."
