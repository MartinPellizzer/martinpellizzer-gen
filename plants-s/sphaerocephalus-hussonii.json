    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus hussonii, commonly known as the Husson's globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate forest environments. It is characterized by its dense, rounded thallus that forms a globular or cushion-like structure. The lichen typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces, and it is often found in shaded, moist habitats. Its color ranges from pale yellow to reddish-brown, depending on the season and environmental conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
