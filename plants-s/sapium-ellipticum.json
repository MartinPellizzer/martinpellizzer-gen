    "intro": "Sapium ellipticum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It has compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate, with elliptical leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries containing toxic seeds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
