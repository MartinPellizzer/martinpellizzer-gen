It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
