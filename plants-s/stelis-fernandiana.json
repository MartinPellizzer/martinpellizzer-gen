    "intro": "Stelis fernandiana, commonly known as the Fernandina stelis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of fleshy, often hairy pseudobulbs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Stelis fernandiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
