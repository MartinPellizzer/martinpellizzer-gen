    "intro": "Selinum coriaceum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically in the spring or summer. Its growth habit is often low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Selinum coriaceum is a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
