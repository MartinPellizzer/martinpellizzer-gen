    "intro": "Scelochilus amboroensis, commonly known as the Amboro orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Bolivia. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late winter and early spring. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Scelochilus amboroensis is considered vulnerable and is a subject of conservation interest."
