    "intro": "Sebastiania bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, palm-like appearance with smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by fruit that resembles a starfruit, though it is not related to the common starfruit. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and potential medicinal properties. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
