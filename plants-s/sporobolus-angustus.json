    "intro": "Sporobolus angustus, commonly known as narrowleaf sandreed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Sporobolus angustus is also valued for its ability to provide forage for wildlife and livestock in its native range."
