    "intro": "Saxifraga derbekii subsp. xerophylla, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
