    "intro": "Sorbus chamaemespilus var. arioides, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal changes in foliage and fruiting display."
