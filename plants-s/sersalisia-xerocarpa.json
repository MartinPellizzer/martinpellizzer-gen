    "intro": "Sersalisia xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert fig, is a shrub native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife and sometimes by humans. Its flowering and fruiting periods are closely tied to seasonal rainfall, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to drought and nutrient-poor soils."
