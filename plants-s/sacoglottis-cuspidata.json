    "intro": "Sacoglottis cuspidata, commonly known as the spined marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Africa. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems that are often covered with small, spiny projections. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically borne in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that aids in water retention. Sacoglottis cuspidata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
