    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 altobracensis, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits a range of morphological variations. It is a natural hybrid between Salix viminalis and Salix schwerinii, resulting in a plant with flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is often found in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its catkin flowers are typically yellow-green, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
