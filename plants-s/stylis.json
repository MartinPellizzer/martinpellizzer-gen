    "intro": "Stylis, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Gentianaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Stylis species are characterized by their showy blue or violet flowers, which often bloom in late summer or early autumn. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stems are often hairy and somewhat succulent. These plants play an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
