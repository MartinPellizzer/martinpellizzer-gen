    "intro": "Striga parvula, commonly known as the dwarf witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and lack of true leaves. The plant relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, often causing significant damage to crops like millet and sorghum. Striga parvula has a short life cycle, with seeds remaining viable in the soil for many years. Its presence poses a major challenge to agricultural productivity in affected regions."
