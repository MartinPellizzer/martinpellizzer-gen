It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and somewhat succulent.
