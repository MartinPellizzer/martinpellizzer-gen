    "intro": "Schizaea occidentalis, commonly known as the western basket fern, is a member of the family Schizaeaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of fertile and sterile fronds. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Schizaea occidentalis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
