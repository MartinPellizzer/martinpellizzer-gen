    "intro": "Stelis crenulata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a distinctive zigzag pattern, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Stelis crenulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
