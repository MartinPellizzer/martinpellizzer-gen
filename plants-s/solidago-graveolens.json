It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to dry soils in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine.
