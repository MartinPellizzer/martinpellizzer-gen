    "intro": "Sorbus subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-angled whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit display."
