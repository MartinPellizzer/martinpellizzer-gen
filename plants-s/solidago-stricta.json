    "intro": "Solidago stricta, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a North American flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are rigid and branching. Solidago stricta plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often used in native plant landscaping."
