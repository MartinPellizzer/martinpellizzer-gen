    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum subsp. sparsipilum, commonly known as the sparsely-hairy potato, is a botanical variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its sparse pubescence on the stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other subspecies. This subspecies is native to the Andes region of South America, where it grows in cooler, high-altitude environments. The tubers are typically smaller and have a slightly different texture compared to the more widely cultivated varieties. It is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to specific ecological conditions."
