    "intro": "Salix longiflora var. psilolepis, commonly known as the slender-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically greenish-yellow in color and appear in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
