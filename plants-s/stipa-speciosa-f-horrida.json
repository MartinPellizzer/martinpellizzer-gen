    "intro": "Stipa speciosa f. horrida, commonly known as the hairy feather grass, is a compact, ornamental grass native to the western United States. It features dense, upright clumps of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tall, slender panicles of pale green to golden flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its unique texture and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
