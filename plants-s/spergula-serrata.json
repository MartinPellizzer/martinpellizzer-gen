    "intro": "Spergula serrata, commonly known as the serrated wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Spergula serrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
