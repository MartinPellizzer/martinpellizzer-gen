    "intro": "Salix phylicoides f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a variant of the narrowleaf willow, characterized by its broader, more lance-shaped leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a rough texture. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
