    "intro": "Sonchus arvensis subsp. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal sowthistle, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in saline and well-drained environments. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in coastal agricultural areas."
