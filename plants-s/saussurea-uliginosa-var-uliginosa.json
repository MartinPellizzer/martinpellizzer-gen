    "intro": "Saussurea uliginosa var. uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh safflower, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments in northern regions. It features a robust root system and tall, leafy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy composite flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale purple ray florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
