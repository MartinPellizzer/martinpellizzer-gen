    "intro": "Stelis lagarophyta, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Stelis lagarophyta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
