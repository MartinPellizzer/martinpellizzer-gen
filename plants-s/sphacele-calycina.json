    "intro": "Sphacele calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in wetland areas and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in some regions. Botanically, it is notable for its complex inflorescence and its role in local ecosystems."
