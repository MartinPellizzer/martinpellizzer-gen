    "intro": "Stevia salicifolia var. aristata, commonly known as the silver leaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is valued for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, which are natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. This variety is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and for its medicinal properties."
