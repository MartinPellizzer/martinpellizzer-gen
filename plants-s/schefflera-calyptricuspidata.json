    "intro": "Schefflera calyptricuspidata, commonly known as the shield-leaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaflets, which give it a distinctive, lush appearance. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, and its foliage often exhibits a subtle variegation in lighter green or yellow tones. Schefflera calyptricuspidata produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is commonly cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor environments."
