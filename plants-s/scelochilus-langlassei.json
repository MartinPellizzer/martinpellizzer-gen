    "intro": "Scelochilus langlassei, commonly known as the Langlasse's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers with vibrant colors, typically in shades of pink and white. Its roots are adapted to cling to rocky substrates, allowing it to grow in harsh mountainous conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scelochilus langlassei is considered a vulnerable species."
