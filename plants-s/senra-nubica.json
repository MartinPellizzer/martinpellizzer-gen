It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Senra nubica plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
