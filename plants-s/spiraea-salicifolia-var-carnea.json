    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia var. carnea, commonly known as the rose-flowered weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that give it a weeping appearance, and its clusters of pink to rose-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to provide seasonal interest throughout the growing season."
