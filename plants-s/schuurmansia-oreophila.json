It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
