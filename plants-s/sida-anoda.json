    "intro": "Sida anoda, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a velvety texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are encased in a fluffy pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Sida anoda is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
