It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive purple foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by berries that mature to a dark purple color. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
