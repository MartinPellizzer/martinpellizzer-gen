    "intro": "Skimmia fortunei var. argentea, commonly known as silver skimmia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and winter bloom."
