    "intro": "Stachys argillicola subsp. argillicola, commonly known as the clayplant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers clustered in whorls, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
