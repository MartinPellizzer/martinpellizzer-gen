    "intro": "Salix eleagnos subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, or other water sources. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
