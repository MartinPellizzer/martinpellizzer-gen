    "intro": "Senecio perennans, commonly known as the everlasting or perpetual grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive bracts that give it its common name. Senecio perennans thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which remain intact for extended periods."
