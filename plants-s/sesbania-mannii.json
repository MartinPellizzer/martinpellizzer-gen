It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its pinnate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields."
