    "intro": "Scadianus, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, lavender-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Scadianus is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Its botanical name, Scadianus, reflects its historical association with the Scadian region, now part of New Mexico."
