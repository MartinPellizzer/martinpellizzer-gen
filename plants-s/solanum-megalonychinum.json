    "intro": "Solanum megalonychinum, commonly known as the large-leaf nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its large, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple. Its berries, which are toxic, mature to a bright red color and are often mistaken for edible fruits. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
