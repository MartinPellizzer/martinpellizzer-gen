    "intro": "Sarracenia rubra subsp. gulfensis, commonly known as the Gulf Coast Pitcher Plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular pitchers that are typically red or orange in color, with a distinct white or yellow border. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized traps that secrete digestive enzymes to break down insect prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light for optimal growth. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to wetland environments and its role in local ecosystems."
