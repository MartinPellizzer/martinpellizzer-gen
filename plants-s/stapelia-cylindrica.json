    "intro": "Stapelia cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom during the warmer months and have a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Stapelia cylindrica is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
