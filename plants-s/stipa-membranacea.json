    "intro": "Stipa membranacea, commonly known as the papergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
