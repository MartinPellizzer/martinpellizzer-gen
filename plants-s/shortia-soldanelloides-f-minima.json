    "intro": "Shortia soldanelloides f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf shortia, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Pontederiaceae and is characterized by its small, showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, preferring rich, acidic soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
