    "intro": "Salsola kali var. altaica, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is a perennial shrub with a sprawling growth habit, featuring fleshy, spiny stems and small, greenish-gray leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into dry, three-lobed fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to Central Asia but has been introduced to many regions around the world. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
