    "intro": "Senegalia tucumanensis, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, flat pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Senegalia tucumanensis plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for its wood and as a source of fodder."
