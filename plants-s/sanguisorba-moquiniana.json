    "intro": "Sanguisorba moquiniana, commonly known as rosebay rhododendron, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, reddish-brown, bract-like structures that persist after the flowers fade. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a fuzzy texture. Sanguisorba moquiniana is often found in moist, open woods and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
