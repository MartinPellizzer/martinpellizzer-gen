    "intro": "Senna versicolor, commonly known as the variable senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and often have a distinctive blue or greenish hue. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senna versicolor is typically found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its seeds are encased in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
