    "intro": "Sabal peregrina, commonly known as the cabbage palm, is a tall, evergreen palm native to the southeastern United States. It has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered with a fibrous, spongy layer called the fibrovascular sheath. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 8 feet in diameter, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, and it produces edible, yellowish fruit that is consumed by various wildlife. Sabal peregrina is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in Florida and along the Gulf Coast."
