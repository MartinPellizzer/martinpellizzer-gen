    "intro": "Sapium glandulatum, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by orange-red\u84b4\u679c that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in some regions. The tree has a shallow root system and is adapted to a wide range of soil types."
