    "intro": "Sporobolus airoides var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
