    "intro": "Stictocardia campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped liverwort, is a type of thalloid liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's thallus is green and covered with small, leaf-like structures called phyllids, which aid in photosynthesis. It reproduces through spores released from leaf-like structures called gametophores, which are often arranged in clusters. Stictocardia campanulata is an important indicator species for assessing the health of moist, undisturbed habitats."
