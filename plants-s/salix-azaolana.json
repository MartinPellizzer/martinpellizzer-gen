    "intro": "Salix azaolana, commonly known as the Azores willow, is a shrub-like plant native to the Azores Islands in Portugal. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its production of small, catkin-like flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to the island's climate and its role in local ecosystems."
