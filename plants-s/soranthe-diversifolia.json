    "intro": "Soranthe diversifolia, commonly known as the variable-leaf soranthe, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to lanceolate, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Soranthe diversifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens."
