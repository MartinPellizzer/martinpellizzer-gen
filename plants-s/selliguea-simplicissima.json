    "intro": "Selliguea simplicissima, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its simple, lobed leaves that form a dense, carpet-like mat on rocky surfaces. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It is often found in temperate regions, particularly in forested areas with high humidity. Selliguea simplicissima plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
