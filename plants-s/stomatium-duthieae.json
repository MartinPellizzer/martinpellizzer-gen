    "intro": "Stomatium duthieae, commonly known as the Duthie's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of northern Scotland. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, facilitating photosynthesis. Its unique morphology allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey. Stomatium duthieae is a rare and specialized species, showcasing adaptations typical of aquatic carnivorous plants."
