    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. gafstiiata, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are typically oval with a serrated edge and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal interest."
