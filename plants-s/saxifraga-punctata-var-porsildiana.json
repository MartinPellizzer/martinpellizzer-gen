    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata var. porsildiana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a single umbel at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
