It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble a fan shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
