    "intro": "Scleropoa maritima, commonly known as the maritime grass, is a hardy perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its deep root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines. Scleropoa maritima is an important species in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
