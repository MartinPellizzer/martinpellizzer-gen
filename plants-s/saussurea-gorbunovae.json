    "intro": "Saussurea gorbunovae, commonly known as the Gorbunov's safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
