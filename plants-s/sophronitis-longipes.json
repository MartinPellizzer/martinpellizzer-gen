    "intro": "Sophronitis longipes, commonly known as the longipes orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, producing fragrant, butterfly-shaped flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
