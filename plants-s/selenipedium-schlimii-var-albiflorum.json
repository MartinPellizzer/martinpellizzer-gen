    "intro": "Selenipedium schlimii var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered selenipedium, is a striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy inflorescence that resembles a pine cone. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces berries that contain the seeds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
