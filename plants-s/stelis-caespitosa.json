    "intro": "Stelis caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. The orchid's botanical features make it an important species in the study of tropical plant ecology."
