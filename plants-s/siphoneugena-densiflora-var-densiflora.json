It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often floating on the water's surface. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wetland environments and its role in local ecosystems."
