    "intro": "Schweiggera, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small, herbaceous plants native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are often pale green or brown. Schweiggera species are often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
