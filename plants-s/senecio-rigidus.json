    "intro": "Senecio rigidus, commonly known as the rigid groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in stiff, hairy leaves that are often blue-green in color. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense heads, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Senecio rigidus is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water during dry periods."
