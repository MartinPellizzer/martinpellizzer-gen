    "intro": "Symphyobasis alsinoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant typically produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves help it conserve water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Symphyobasis alsinoides is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the edges of deserts and in coastal dunes."
