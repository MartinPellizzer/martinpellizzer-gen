    "intro": "Solanum diffusum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant features sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Solanum diffusum is often found in moist, shaded environments and can be invasive in certain regions."
