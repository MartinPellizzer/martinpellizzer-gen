    "intro": "Spathoglottis malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Spathoglottis malabarica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
