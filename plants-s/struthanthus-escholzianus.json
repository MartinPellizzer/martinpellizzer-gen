It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, round, greenish-brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its native habitat. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
