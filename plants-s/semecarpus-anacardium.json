    "intro": "Semecarpus anacardium, commonly known as the Indian chestnut or bishtar. It is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spiny, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its seeds are encased in a hard, toxic shell, and the plant contains compounds like urushiol, which can cause skin irritation. It is often found in moist, shady habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
