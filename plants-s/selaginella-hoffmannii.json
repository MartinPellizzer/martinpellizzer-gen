    "intro": "Selaginella hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features whorled leaves that are usually spirally arranged along its stems, and it produces spores in specialized structures called strobila. Selaginella hoffmannii is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive biology. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in the study of early land plant evolution."
