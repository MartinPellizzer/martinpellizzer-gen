It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Synostemon arenosus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
