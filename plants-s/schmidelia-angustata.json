    "intro": "Schmidelia angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf schmidelia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Schmidelia angustata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
