    "intro": "Swartzia krukovii, commonly known as the African ebony, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and workability. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and timber importance, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
