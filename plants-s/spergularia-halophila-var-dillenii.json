    "intro": "Spergularia halophila var. dillenii, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and inland salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of salt-tolerant vegetation. This variety is often found in regions with a temperate climate and is noted for its resilience in harsh, arid conditions."
