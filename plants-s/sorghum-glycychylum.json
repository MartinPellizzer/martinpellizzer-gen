    "intro": "Sorghum glycychylum, commonly known as the white sorghum, is a flowering plant native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and feathery inflorescence. The plant produces small, two-lobed flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are narrow and have a slight hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Sorghum glycychylum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a forage crop in arid environments."
