    "intro": "Sclerochloa angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains of pale to dark brown seeds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish dense vegetation in sandy soils. Sclerochloa angusta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
