    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild."
