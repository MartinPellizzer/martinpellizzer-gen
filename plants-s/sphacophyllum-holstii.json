    "intro": "Sphacophyllum holstii, commonly known as the Holst's sphacelium, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a thallus that is often prostrate or loosely cushion-like, with small, closely packed leaves. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
