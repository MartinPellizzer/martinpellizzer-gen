    "intro": "Sasa oblongula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bamboo, is a perennial grass-like plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps and spread vegetatively. Sasa oblongula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional landscaping."
