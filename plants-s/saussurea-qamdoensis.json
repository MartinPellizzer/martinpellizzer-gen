It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, yellow to orange flower heads. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and lanceolate leaves with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
