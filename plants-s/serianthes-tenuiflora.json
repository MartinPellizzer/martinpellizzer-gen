    "intro": "Serianthes tenuiflora, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, fluted trunk and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody pods containing flat, dark seeds. It is valued for its aromatic heartwood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of sandalwood oil. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as endangered in several regions."
