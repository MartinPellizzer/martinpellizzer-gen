    "intro": "Smilax elegans var. major, commonly known as the red root or common smilax, is a vigorous climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features a woody stem covered in sharp, spiny tubers that serve as a defense mechanism. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. Smilax elegans var. major is commonly found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
