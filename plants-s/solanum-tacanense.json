    "intro": "Solanum tacanense, commonly known as the Tacana nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are not edible for humans or animals. Solanum tacanense is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
