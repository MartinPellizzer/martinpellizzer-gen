    "intro": "Scirpus setaceus var. monander, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and flowering spikes that emerge from water or moist soil. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp terrestrial habitats, such as marshes and pond edges. Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
