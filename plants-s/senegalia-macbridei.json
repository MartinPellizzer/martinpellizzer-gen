    "intro": "Senegalia macbridei, commonly known as the desert honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of long, slender pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Senegalia macbridei plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
