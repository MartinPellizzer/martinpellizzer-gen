    "intro": "Sabia swinhoei var. subcorymbosa, commonly known as the fragrant forest orchid, is a rare and ornamental orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a pale yellow to white coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
