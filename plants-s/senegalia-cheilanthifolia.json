    "intro": "Senegalia cheilanthifolia, commonly known as the desert bristlecone, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small compound leaves, and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod that opens to release the seeds when dry. Senegalia cheilanthifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
