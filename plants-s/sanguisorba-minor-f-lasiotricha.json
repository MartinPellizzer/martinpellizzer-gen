It features upright, branching stems that are densely covered with soft, grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by bracts that add to its ornamental value. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and they turn a striking red or orange color in the fall. This cultivar is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
