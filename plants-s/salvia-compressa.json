    "intro": "Salvia compressa, commonly known as narrowleaf sage, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
