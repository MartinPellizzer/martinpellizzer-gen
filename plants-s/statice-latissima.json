    "intro": "Statice latissima, commonly known as sea lavender, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and strong winds. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important species in erosion control. Statice latissima is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
