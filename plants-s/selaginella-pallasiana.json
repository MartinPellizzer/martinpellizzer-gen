    "intro": "Selaginella pallasiana, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, moss-like structure. Its sporophyte stage produces spores on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella pallasiana is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
