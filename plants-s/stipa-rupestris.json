    "intro": "Stipa rupestris, commonly known as the rockgrass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high altitudes and low precipitation. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Stipa rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
