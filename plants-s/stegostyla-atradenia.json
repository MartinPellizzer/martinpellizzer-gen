    "intro": "Stegostyla atradenia, commonly known as the black-flowered rock orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its greenish-yellow sepals and petals. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Stegostyla atradenia is a rare and often elusive species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
