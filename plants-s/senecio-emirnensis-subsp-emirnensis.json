    "intro": "Senecio emirnensis subsp. emirnensis, commonly known as the Emirnensis groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect stems and basal rosettes of narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
