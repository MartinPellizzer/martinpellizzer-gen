    "intro": "Scleria reflexa var. surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in suitable habitats. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
