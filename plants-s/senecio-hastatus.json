    "intro": "Senecio hastatus, commonly known as the wooly sedum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its fuzzy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates."
