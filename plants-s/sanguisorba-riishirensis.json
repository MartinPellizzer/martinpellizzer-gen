    "intro": "Sanguisorba riishirensis, commonly known as the Japanese teasel, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescences and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Sanguisorba riishirensis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
