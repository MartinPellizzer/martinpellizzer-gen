    "intro": "Steiropteris fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its fibrous roots, which help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. Steiropteris fraseri plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
