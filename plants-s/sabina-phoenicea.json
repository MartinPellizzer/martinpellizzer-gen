    "intro": "Sabina phoenicea, commonly known as the Canary Island cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental appeal. Sabina phoenicea is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and distinctive appearance."
