    "intro": "Silene silvestris, commonly known as the woodland catchfly, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features pink to purple flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene silvestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
