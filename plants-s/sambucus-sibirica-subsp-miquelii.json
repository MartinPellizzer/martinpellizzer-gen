    "intro": "Sambucus sibirica subsp. miquelii, commonly known as the Siberian elderberry, is a shrub native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the autumn. These berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their high acidity. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
