    "intro": "Symphytum rakosiense, commonly known as Rakosi's comfrey, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces showy blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
