    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus var. digynus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-brown spikelets at the top of the stem. Its rhizomes are extensive and help it spread across wetlands through vegetative propagation. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
