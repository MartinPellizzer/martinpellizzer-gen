    "intro": "Salix exigua var. columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its flowers are catkins, which are cylindrical and appear in early spring. The Columbia willow is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
