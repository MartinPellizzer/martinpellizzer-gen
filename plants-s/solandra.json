    "intro": "Solandra, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to Central and South America and are characterized by their large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that open at night. The flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Solandra species are typically shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and glossy, dark green leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental beauty and unique blooming habit."
