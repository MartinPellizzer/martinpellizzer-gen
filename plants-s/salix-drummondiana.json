    "intro": "Salix drummondiana, commonly known as Drummond's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, stream banks, and riparian zones. Its fibrous bark and flexible branches make it adaptable to various waterlogged soils."
