    "intro": "Stipa pennata var. grafiana, commonly known as the Grafina feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of fine, needle-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, wind-swaying form."
