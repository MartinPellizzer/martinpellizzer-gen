It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that attracts various bird species, contributing to its role in seed dispersal."
