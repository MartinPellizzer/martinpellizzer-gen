    "intro": "Scirpus supinus var. digynus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall grassy appearance. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
