    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 megaseiflora, commonly known as the giant saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has a rosette-forming growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
