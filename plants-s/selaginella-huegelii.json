    "intro": "Selaginella huegelii, commonly known as the Hart's tongue fern, is a unique spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a distinctive morphology, with long, strap-like leaves that form a dense, fleshy rosette. The plant is characterized by its ability to survive in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized branches called microsporophylls and megasporophylls. Selaginella huegelii is also notable for its ability to undergo vegetative reproduction through the growth of new plants from its rhizomes."
