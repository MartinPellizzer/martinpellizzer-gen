It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by yellowish fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
