    "intro": "Sonchus palmensis, commonly known as the palmate sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in open habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
