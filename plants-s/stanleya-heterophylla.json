    "intro": "Stanleya heterophylla, commonly known as the Colorado larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has a taproot system and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves and flowers exhibit polymorphism, with variations in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. Stanleya heterophylla is also notable for its toxic alkaloids, which deter herbivores."
