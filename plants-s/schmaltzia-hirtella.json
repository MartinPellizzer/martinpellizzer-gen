    "intro": "Schmaltzia hirtella, commonly known as the hairy schmaltzia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Loasaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Schmaltzia hirtella has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full sun."
