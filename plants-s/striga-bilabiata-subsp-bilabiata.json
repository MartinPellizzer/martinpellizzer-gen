    "intro": "Striga bilabiata subsp. bilabiata, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from host roots. It is a significant agricultural pest, particularly affecting cereal crops like maize and sorghum. Due to its invasive nature, it poses a major challenge to food security in affected regions."
