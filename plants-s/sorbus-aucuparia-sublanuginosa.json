    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia sublanuginosa, commonly known as the downy whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits known as sorbus. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. The species is often found in woodland edges, rocky areas, and coastal regions, thriving in well-drained soils."
