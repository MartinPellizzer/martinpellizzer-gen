    "intro": "Solanum hasslerianum f. oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It features oval-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of the species, giving it its distinguishing name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
