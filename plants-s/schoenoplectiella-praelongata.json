    "intro": "Schoenoplectiella praelongata, commonly known as the long-stalked bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually tall and upright, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes are usually greenish or brownish and appear at the top of the stems. Schoenoplectiella praelongata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
