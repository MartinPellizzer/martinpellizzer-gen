    "intro": "Selaginella hupehensis, commonly known as the Chinese clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like structures. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many primitive vascular plants. Selaginella hupehensis is also notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including drought and fire, due to its unique reproductive and physiological adaptations."
