    "intro": "Sporobolus tsiafajavonensis, commonly known as the Madagascar grass, is a perennial grass species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stem, with small, pale green to brown florets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its drought resistance. Sporobolus tsiafajavonensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
