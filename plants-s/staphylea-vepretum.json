    "intro": "Staphylea vepretum, commonly known as the European hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts that mature in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. Staphylea vepretum is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
