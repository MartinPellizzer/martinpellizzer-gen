    "intro": "Sium turfosum, commonly known as marsh hogweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in North America. It features a tall, hollow stem covered in fine hairs and large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Sium turfosum is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
