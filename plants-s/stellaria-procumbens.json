    "intro": "Stellaria procumbens, commonly known as white sandstar, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which are typically arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in sandy or disturbed soils. Stellaria procumbens is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats."
