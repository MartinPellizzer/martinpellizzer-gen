    "intro": "Selinum perfoliatum, commonly known as mountain garlic, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clustered umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Selinum perfoliatum is also valued as a decorative plant in gardens for its attractive foliage and resilience in rocky soils."
