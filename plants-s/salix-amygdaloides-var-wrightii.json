    "intro": "Salix amygdaloides var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and long, pendulous catkins that give it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, woody fruits that disperse seeds by wind. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
