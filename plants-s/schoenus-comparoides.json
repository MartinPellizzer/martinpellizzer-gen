    "intro": "Schoenus comparoides, commonly known as the coastal bulrush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often forming dense stands that stabilize shorelines and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed coastal environments."
