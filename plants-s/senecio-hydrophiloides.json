    "intro": "Senecio hydrophiloides, commonly known as the water-loving groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Due to its preference for waterlogged conditions, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
