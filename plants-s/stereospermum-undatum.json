    "intro": "Stereospermum undatum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique wood structure and its role in local ecosystems. However, it is also considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
