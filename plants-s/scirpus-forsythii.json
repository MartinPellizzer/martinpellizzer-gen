    "intro": "Scirpus forsythii, commonly known as the Chinese bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, ponds, and other wetland habitats. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown, and it blooms from summer to autumn. Scirpus forsythii has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
