    "intro": "Sarcolobus venulosus, commonly known as the veined bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it uses its specialized organs to obtain nutrients. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Sarcolobus venulosus is native to parts of Europe and is adapted to thrive in moist, temperate environments."
