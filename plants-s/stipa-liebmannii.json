    "intro": "Stipa liebmannii, commonly known as Liebmann's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps and fine, silver-green foliage that turns reddish in autumn. The plant produces slender, spikelike inflorescences that are often adorned with silky, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Stipa liebmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
