    "intro": "Sinia rhodoleuca, commonly known as the red-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and striking red foliage, which becomes more prominent in the fall. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by capsule fruits. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks."
