    "intro": "Solanum trisectum, commonly known as the three-lobed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that mature to a bright red color. Solanum trisectum belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and peppers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
