    "intro": "Sedum douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments. Sedum douglasii is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
