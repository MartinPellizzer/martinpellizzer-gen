    "intro": "Semiliquidambar cuspidata, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age. The red maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
