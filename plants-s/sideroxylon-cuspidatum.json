    "intro": "Sideroxylon cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is often found in lowland rainforests and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
