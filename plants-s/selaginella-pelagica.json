    "intro": "Selaginella pelagica, commonly known as the sea sprout, is a unique vascular plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is notable for its ability to survive in high-salinity conditions. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around its stems, reducing water loss in harsh maritime climates. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Selaginella pelagica is often found on rocky shores and tidal zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils."
