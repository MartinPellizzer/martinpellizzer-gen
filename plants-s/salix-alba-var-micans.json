    "intro": "Salix alba var. micans, commonly known as the silver willow, is a variant of the white willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn season. It typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, preferring temperate climates. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, oval berries that are edible for certain wildlife."
