    "intro": "Scilla exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Scilla exigua is valued for its early blooming habit and ornamental appeal in garden settings."
