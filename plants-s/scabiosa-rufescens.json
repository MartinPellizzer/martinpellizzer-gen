    "intro": "Scabiosa rufescens, commonly known as the redstem scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Scabiosa rufescens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and meadows. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against herbivores."
