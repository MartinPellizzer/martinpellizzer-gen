These plants are characterized by their rosettes of fleshy, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Stemonacanthus species are typically herbaceous and thrive in warm, humid environments. They are often cultivated as houseplants due to their ornamental value and ease of care. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plants are adapted to grow in well-drained soil."
