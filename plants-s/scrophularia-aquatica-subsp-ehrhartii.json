    "intro": "Scrophularia aquatica subsp. ehrhartii, commonly known as water figwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive hairy texture. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, are clustered in whorls along the stem and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
