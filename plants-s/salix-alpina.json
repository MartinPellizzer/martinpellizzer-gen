    "intro": "Salix alpina, commonly known as the Alpine willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and elongated leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its main reproductive structures, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Salix alpina thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various alpine species."
