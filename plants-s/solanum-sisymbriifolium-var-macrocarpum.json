    "intro": "Solanum sisymbriifolium var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, fleshy berries that turn from green to red as they mature. The berries contain numerous seeds and are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Botanically, it is characterized by its solanaceous features, including the presence of alkaloids and a distinctive fruit structure."
