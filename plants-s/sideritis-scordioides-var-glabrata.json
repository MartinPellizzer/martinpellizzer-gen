    "intro": "Sideritis scordioides var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sainfoin, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrata' variety has reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. This species is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
