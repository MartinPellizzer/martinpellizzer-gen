    "intro": "Silene muscipula var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils, such as marshes and bogs. Its flowers are pink to purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is closely related to the more well-known S. muscipula, but differs in its narrower leaves and slightly different habitat preferences."
