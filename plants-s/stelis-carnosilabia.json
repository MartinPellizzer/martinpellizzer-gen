    "intro": "Stelis carnosilabia, commonly known as the pink-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Stelis carnosilabia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
