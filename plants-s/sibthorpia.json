    "intro": "Sibthorpia, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Sibthorpia species are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and small, fig-like fruits that are often used as food by local wildlife. They typically grow on rocky outcrops and are well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The genus includes several species, such as Sibthorpia europaea and Sibthorpia trachyphylla, which are valued for their ornamental and ecological significance."
