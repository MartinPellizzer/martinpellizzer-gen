    "intro": "Silene mesatlantica subsp. mesatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic silene, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of maritime forests. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
