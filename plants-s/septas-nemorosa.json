    "intro": "Septas nemorosa, commonly known as the forest bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to woodland areas in Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Septas nemorosa is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments, making it a characteristic species of temperate forests."
