    "intro": "Salix pedicellaris subsp. hypoglauca, commonly known as the white willow, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a pale green on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or wetlands. Its bark is thin and peels easily, and it has been used historically for its medicinal properties. The subspecies hypoglauca is distinguished by its lighter-colored leaves and more delicate appearance compared to other members of the Salix genus."
