It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, with the lemma and palea bearing long, hairy glumes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
