    "intro": "Stipellaria, commonly known as the \"buttercup grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, clustered inflorescences. The plants typically have narrow leaves and produce yellow or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Stipellaria species are often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
