    "intro": "Sticherus montaguei, commonly known as the Montague's sticherus, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a leafy, flattened body that is often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop on the upper surface of the thallus and produce spores for dispersal. Sticherus montaguei is primarily found in temperate regions and is often used as an indicator species for assessing the health of moist, undisturbed habitats."
