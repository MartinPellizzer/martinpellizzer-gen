    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. petiolata, commonly known as the purple willow with petioles, is a variant of the purple willow native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows near water bodies, such as rivers and wetlands, due to its preference for moist soils. The plant features slender, flexible branches with heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple on the underside. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated, and it produces small, round samaras for seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
