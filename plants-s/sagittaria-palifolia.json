    "intro": "Sagittaria palifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a distinctive V-shaped base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that emerge on slender stalks above the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. Sagittaria palifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
