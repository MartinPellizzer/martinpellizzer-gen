    "intro": "Shorea micans, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, reaching heights of up to 40 meters. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Shorea micans also produces small, yellowish flowers and is an important component of the region's biodiversity."
