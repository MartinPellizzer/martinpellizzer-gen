    "intro": "Saxifraga micranthidifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
