    "intro": "Scirpus ochreatus, commonly known as the yellow bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with a yellowish hue, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered brown flowers that appear in late summer. Scirpus ochreatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
