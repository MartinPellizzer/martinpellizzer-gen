    "intro": "Sibbaldia polygyna, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of hairs. Sibbaldia polygyna is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and cold temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its rocky habitat."
