    "intro": "Solanum pulchrilobum, commonly known as the beautiful-lobed nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that range from dark green to almost black in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in the evening. Its fruit is a globose berry that turns from green to yellowish when mature. Solanum pulchrilobum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and nocturnal flowering habit."
