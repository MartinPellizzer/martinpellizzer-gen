    "intro": "Saxifraga bronchialis subsp. codyana, commonly known as Cody's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth."
