    "intro": "Salisburyodendron montana, commonly known as the mountain sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark that peels to reveal a lighter inner layer. The tree has large, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The fruit is a cylindrical, woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds."
