    "intro": "Sabulina bannatica, commonly known as the Bannat sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, rocky environments it inhabits. Sabulina bannatica is often found in alpine meadows and is a component of the unique flora of the Changbai Mountains."
