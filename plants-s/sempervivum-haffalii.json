    "intro": "Sempervivum haffalii, commonly known as the Haffalii stonecrop, is a hardy succulent native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a powdery bloom, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Sempervivum haffalii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
