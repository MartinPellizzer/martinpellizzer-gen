    "intro": "Schwenkfelda hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy schwenkfeldia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is known for its delicate, umbel-shaped inflorescence that bears small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its hairy foliage and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a potential candidate for horticultural cultivation."
