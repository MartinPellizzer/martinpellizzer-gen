    "intro": "Scabiosa ochroleuca var. webbiana, commonly known as the Webb's scabious, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, pinkish-white flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and grayish-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
