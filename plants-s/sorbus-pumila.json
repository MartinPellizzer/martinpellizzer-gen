    "intro": "Sorbus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous shrub or tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Sorbus pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
