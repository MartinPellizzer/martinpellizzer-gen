    "intro": "Saxifraga aequidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, rosette-forming leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga aequidentata is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
