    "intro": "Streptopus roseus subsp. perspectus, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, pale pink stems and small, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the southeastern United States, this subspecies thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine rocklands and scrub habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
