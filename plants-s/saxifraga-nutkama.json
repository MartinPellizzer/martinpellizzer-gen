    "intro": "Saxifraga nutkama, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant features a basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Saxifraga nutkama is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
