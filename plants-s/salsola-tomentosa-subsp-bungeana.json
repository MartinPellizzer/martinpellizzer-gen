    "intro": "Salsola tomentosa subsp. bungeana, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in sandy soils and is used in some regions for erosion control and as a forage plant."
