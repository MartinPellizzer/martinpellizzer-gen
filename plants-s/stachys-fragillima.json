    "intro": "Stachys fragillima, commonly known as fragile hedge nettle, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to reddish flowers in whorled clusters, which are often mistaken for leaves due to their shape. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Stachys fragillima is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
