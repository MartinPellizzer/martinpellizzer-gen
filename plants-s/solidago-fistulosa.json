    "intro": "Solidago fistulosa, commonly known as the greenstem goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn. Its flowering period makes it an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
