    "intro": "Sonchus microcarpus, commonly known as lesser sonchus, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spiny, spherical seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
