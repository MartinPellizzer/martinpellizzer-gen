It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a compact, mat-forming structure with closely packed, needle-like leaves. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing cones, which are borne on specialized branches. Selaginella congoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
