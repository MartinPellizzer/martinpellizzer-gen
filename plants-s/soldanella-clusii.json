It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its foliage consists of dark green, ovate leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Soldanella clusii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or rocky habitats."
