    "intro": "Silene petraea, commonly known as the rock catchfly, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pink or purple flowers with five petals. The plant has hairy stems and leaves adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it often thrives in crevices and on rock faces. Silene petraea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat and supports pollinators such as bees and flies."
