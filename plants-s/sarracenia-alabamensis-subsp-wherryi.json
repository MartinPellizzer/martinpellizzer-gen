    "intro": "Sarracenia alabamensis subsp. wherryi, commonly known as the Wherry's pitcher plant, is a rare and specialized carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, red-tinged pitchers that secrete a digestive enzyme to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic wetlands and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to survive. Its leaves are typically upright and form a dense rosette, which helps in trapping prey. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its wetland habitat."
