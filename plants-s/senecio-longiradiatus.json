The plant has finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for Mediterranean climate gardens."
