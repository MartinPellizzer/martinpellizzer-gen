    "intro": "Schedonorus nigrescens, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, slightly bluish leaves that are typically narrow and slightly rolled. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered at the base of the leaf blades. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Schedonorus nigrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, fine-textured foliage."
