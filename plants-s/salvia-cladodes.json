    "intro": "Salvia cladodes, commonly known as golden crownbeard, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs like mint and sage. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
