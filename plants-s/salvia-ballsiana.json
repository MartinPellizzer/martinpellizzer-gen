    "intro": "Salvia ballsiana, commonly known as the mountain sage, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators, it is valued both in horticulture and ecological landscapes."
