    "intro": "Solanum torvum var. polyacanthum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a vigorous perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features sprawling growth habit with thick, hairy stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to berries that start green and mature to a bright orange or red color. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
