    "intro": "Salix cutleri f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low growth habit, typically reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and flowers in early spring. This species is well adapted to harsh conditions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils and tolerating low temperatures."
