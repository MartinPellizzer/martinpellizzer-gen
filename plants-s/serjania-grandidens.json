    "intro": "Serjania grandidens, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or Brazilian yellowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and dense, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellow, star-shaped fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Serjania grandidens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure."
