    "intro": "Sapium tuerckheimianum, commonly known as the red swamp cypress, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and its ability to thrive in wetland environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by reddish-brown fruits that contain three seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Sapium tuerckheimianum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
