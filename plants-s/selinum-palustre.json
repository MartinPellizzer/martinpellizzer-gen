    "intro": "Selinum palustre, commonly known as swamp sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, often reddish stems that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Selinum palustre thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
