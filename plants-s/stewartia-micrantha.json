    "intro": "Stewartia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered stewartia, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by elliptical, dark purple berries. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Stewartia micrantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and graceful form."
