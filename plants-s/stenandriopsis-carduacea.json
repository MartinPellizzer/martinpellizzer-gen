It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, this plant thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant's structure includes a basal rosette of leaves with a central stem that bears the inflorescence. It is often found in scrublands and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
