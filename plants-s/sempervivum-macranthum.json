It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a bluish or silver hue. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of showy, pink or red flowers in the summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a houseplant. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often persisting through harsh winters."
