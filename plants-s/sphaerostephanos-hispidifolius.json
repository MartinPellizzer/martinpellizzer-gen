    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos hispidifolius, commonly known as the hairy-leaved starflower, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
