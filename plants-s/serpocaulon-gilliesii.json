    "intro": "Serpocaulon gilliesii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed serpocaulon, is a small, perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. It has a fibrous root system and produces seed capsules that release tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
