    "intro": "Solanum africanum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a capsule fruit that splits open to release seeds. Solanum africanum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
