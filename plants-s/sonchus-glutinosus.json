    "intro": "Sonchus glutinosus, commonly known as sticky lettuce, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular substance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It grows up to 60 cm tall and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
