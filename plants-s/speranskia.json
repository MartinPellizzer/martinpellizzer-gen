    "intro": "Speranskia, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble lanterns. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. Speranskia species produce small, yellowish flowers that are followed by the showy, inflated fruits. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant, colorful bracts."
