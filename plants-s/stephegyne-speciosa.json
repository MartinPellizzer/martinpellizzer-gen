    "intro": "Stephegyne speciosa, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces toxic berries that contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture and a waxy surface. Stephegyne speciosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests."
