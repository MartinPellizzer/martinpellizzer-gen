It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky areas. Squilla glaucophylla is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
