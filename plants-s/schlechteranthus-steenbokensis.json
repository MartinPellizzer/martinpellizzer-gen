    "intro": "Schlechteranthus steenbokensis, commonly known as the Norwegian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Norway. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Schlechteranthus steenbokensis is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
