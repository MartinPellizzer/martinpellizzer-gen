    "intro": "Senegalia grenadensis, commonly known as the Grenada acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Grenada. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its slender, often thorned branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets, and it has a deep root system adapted to dry conditions. Senegalia grenadensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
