It is characterized by its striking, spherical flower heads that resemble small globes, composed of numerous tiny, star-shaped flowers. These plants are native to South Africa and are typically found in rocky or sandy soils. Sphaerocionium species are perennial herbs that produce showy blooms in spring or summer. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
