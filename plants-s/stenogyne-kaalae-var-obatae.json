    "intro": "Stenogyne kaalae var. obatae, commonly known as the Kalaheo leafy green, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, which bloom during the summer months. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from invasive species, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
