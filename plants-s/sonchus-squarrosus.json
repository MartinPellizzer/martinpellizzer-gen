    "intro": "Sonchus squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly lettuce, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that are typically lobed or deeply toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution and invasive potential in some regions."
