    "intro": "Solanum japurense var. stellatopubescens, commonly known as the star-hairy nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves with a distinctive star-shaped pubescence. The flowers are typically white or purple, with five lobes, and the plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens."
