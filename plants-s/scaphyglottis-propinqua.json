    "intro": "Scaphyglottis propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and typically grows in moist, sandy soils near water bodies. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers with a distinct lip. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
