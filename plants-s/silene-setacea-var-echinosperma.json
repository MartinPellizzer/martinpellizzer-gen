    "intro": "Silene setacea var. echinosperma, commonly known as the spiny-fruited catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and hairy leaves that are often glandular. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that becomes spiny and hairy as it matures, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils."
