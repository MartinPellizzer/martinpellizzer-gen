    "intro": "Symplocos lancifolia var. cryptostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
