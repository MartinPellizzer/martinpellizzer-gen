It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and dense clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered with a thick layer of fine hairs. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting local pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
