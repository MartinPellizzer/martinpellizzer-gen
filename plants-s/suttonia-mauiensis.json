It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and dry, sandy soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
