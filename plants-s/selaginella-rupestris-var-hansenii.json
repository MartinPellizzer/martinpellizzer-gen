    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of Central America. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. The plant features compact, needle-like leaves that are often clustered around short, branching stems. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
