    "intro": "Sparganium ramosum subvar. platycarpum, commonly known as narrow-fruit bur reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spiky, cylindrical fruits. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially submerged. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense canopy that helps stabilize aquatic environments. This subvariety is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated fruits compared to other forms of Sparganium ramosum."
