    "intro": "Seddera glomerata subsp. dhofarensis, commonly known as the Dhofar seddera, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of Oman. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it resilient in semi-desert conditions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a species of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
