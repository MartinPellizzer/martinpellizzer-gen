    "intro": "Seaforthia furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy seaforthia, is a unique flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides protection against salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires minimal water once established. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
