It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found on steep slopes and cliffs. The plant features small, basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in clusters. It is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments with strong winds and limited soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
