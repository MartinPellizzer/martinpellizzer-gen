It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its adaptability and low maintenance requirements make it a favored plant among gardeners seeking drought-tolerant species."
