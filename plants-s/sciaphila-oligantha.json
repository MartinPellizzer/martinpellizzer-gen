    "intro": "Sciaphila oligantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of dense forests. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Its unique appearance and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sciaphila oligantha is considered endangered in many regions."
