It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of small, fragrant flowers that hang from long, slender stems. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Sponia pendula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, cascading blooms."
