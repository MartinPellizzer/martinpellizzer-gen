    "intro": "Stellaria recurvata var. recurvata, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has thin, erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
