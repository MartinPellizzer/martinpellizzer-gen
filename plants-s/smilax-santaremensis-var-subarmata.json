    "intro": "Smilax santaremensis var. subarmata, commonly known as the Santeramen subarmate smilax, is a species of climbing shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of the Lesser Antilles. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of spines, which are typical features of the Smilax genus. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
