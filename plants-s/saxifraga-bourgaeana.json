    "intro": "Saxifraga bourgaeana, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Saxifraga bourgaeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
