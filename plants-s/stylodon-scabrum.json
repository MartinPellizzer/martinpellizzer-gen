    "intro": "Stylodon scabrum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems covered in rough, scaly textures. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Stylodon scabrum produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family."
