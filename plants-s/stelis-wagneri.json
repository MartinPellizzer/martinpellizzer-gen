    "intro": "Stelis wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow blossoms that bloom during the wet season. Stelis wagneri is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
