    "intro": "Salix hastata var. subalpina, commonly known as the subalpine willow, is a shrub native to mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It produces catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. This species is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
