    "intro": "Syngonanthus arenarius var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the sandstone flax, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fibrous, creeping stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky or sandy substrates. Its fibrous stems have been historically used for making ropes and textiles by indigenous communities."
