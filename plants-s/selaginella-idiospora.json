    "intro": "Selaginella idiospora, commonly known as the \"whisk fern,\" is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its root-like structures called rhizomes and its ability to reproduce through spores rather than seeds. The plant exhibits a distinct morphology with a central stem and small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered. It is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Selaginella idiospora is also notable for its ancient lineage, being one of the oldest known vascular plant groups."
