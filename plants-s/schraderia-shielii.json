    "intro": "Schraderia shielii, commonly known as the Shiel's schraderia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Schraderia shielii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
