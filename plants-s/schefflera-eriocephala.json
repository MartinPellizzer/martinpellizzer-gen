    "intro": "Schefflera eriocephala, commonly known as the velvetleaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage composed of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. Schefflera eriocephala is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
