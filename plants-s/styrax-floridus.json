    "intro": "Styrax floridus, commonly known as the Florida styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Styrax floridus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and floral display."
