    "intro": "Salsola auriculata, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in saline soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures. Salsola auriculata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
