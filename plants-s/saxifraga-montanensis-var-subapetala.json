    "intro": "Saxifraga montanensis var. subapetala, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a compact, low-growing form with basal leaves that are often rosette-shaped. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters and blooming in early summer. This variant is distinguished by its reduced petals, giving it a unique appearance compared to other saxifrage species."
