    "intro": "Salix sibirica var. brachypoda, commonly known as the Siberian willow, is a shrub native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to harsh climates and can tolerate frost and poor soil conditions."
