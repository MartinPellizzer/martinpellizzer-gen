    "intro": "Symphyllia, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Viscaceae, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its leaves, which are modified into small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish berries that contain sticky seeds, facilitating attachment to new hosts. Symphyllia thrives in temperate regions and is often found in forests where its host trees are abundant. Its ecological role includes providing food for birds and insects, while also impacting the growth of its host plants."
