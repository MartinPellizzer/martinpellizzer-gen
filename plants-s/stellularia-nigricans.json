It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often dark purple or black in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Small white to pale yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems."
