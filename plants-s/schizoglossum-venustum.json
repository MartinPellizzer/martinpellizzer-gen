    "intro": "Schizoglossum venustum, commonly known as the golden star lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble small stars, blooming in late spring. The plant has strap-like leaves that are broad and slightly curled at the edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
