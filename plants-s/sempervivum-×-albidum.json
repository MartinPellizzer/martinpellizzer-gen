    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 albidum, commonly known as the white stonecrop, is a hybrid succulent plant belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish powdery coating, known as farina. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to harsh, rocky environments. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow during the summer months. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and rockeries."
