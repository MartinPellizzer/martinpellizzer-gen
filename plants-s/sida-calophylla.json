    "intro": "Sida calophylla, commonly known as the coastal sida, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows in sandy or saline soils. The plant has small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, and its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture. Sida calophylla is adapted to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it a common sight in dune ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
