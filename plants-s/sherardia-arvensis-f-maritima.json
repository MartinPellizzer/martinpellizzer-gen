It is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and coastal dunes. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
