It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils.
