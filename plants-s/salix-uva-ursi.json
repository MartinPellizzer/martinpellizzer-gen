    "intro": "Salix uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Salix uva-ursi is also known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
