    "intro": "Saponaria filipes, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Saponaria filipes thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is also noted for its mild soapy scent, which is derived from the saponin compounds present in its tissues."
