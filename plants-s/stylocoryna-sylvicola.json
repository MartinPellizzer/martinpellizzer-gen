    "intro": "Stylocoryna sylvicola, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, herbaceous stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in freshwater habitats. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth surface, while its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils. Stylocoryna sylvicola plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators."
