    "intro": "Stenogyne novalimontis, commonly known as the Kauai mountain mint, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. This species is typically found in moist, shaded habitats on mountain slopes and in forest understories. Its small, tubular flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, dry fruits called nutlets. Stenogyne novalimontis is considered endangered due to habitat loss and introduced species."
