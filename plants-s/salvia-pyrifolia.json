    "intro": "Salvia pyrifolia, commonly known as the fireleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, maple-like leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive reddish or bronze hue. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Salvia pyrifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
