    "intro": "Selaginella shakotanensis, commonly known as the Shakotan clubmoss, is a rare and unique vascular plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, making it an important subject for botanical study. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
