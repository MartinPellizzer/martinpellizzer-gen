    "intro": "Saussurea amara f. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed saffron spice, is a rare and delicate flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, pale yellow to white ray florets. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
