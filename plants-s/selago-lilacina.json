    "intro": "Selago lilacina, commonly known as the pink sandalwood or pink sandalwood tree, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been traditionally used in perfumery and medicine. Selago lilacina thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments."
