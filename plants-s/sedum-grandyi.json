It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
