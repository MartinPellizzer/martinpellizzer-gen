    "intro": "Stipagrostis pogonoptila subsp. tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme desert conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies plays a crucial role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for local wildlife."
