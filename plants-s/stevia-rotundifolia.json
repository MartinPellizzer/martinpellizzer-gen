    "intro": "Stevia rotundifolia, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are oval and rounded, with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring sweeteners. Stevia rotundifolia is widely cultivated for its use in herbal teas and as a natural sweetener alternative."
