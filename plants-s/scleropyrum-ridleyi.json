    "intro": "Scleropyrum ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan sandpaper tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its unique texture and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation."
