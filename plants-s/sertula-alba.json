    "intro": "Sertula alba, commonly known as the white sertula, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Sertula alba is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
