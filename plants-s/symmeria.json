    "intro": "Symmeria, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, clustered flowers that often resemble a crown. Symmeria species typically have a smooth, bark-like trunk and produce small, fleshy fruits. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
