    "intro": "Scytophyllum laurinum, commonly known as the laurel fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble small, rounded leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, and is native to regions in Southeast Asia. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Scytophyllum laurinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
