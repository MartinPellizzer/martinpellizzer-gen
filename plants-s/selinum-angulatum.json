    "intro": "Selinum angulatum, commonly known as the angular wormwood, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Selinum angulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract beneficial insects."
