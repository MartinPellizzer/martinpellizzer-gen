    "intro": "Stipa barbata var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, wiry stems with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, feathery panicles of light green to golden spikelets, which are characteristic of the Stipa genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
