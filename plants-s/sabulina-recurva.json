It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and appear in clusters near the base of the plant. Sabulina recurva plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
