    "intro": "Schedonorus littoreus, commonly known as sea oats, is a coastal grass native to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and long, drooping seed heads that sway with the wind. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly adapted to salt spray and tidal conditions. Its extensive root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Schedonorus littoreus plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of coastal ecosystems."
