    "intro": "Smilax hawaiensis, commonly known as Hawaiian smilax, is a perennial vine native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of spines, which are modified leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forests. Smilax hawaiensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for native birds and insects."
