    "intro": "Spyridium bifidum subsp. wanillae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spyridium, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
