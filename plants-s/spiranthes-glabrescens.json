    "intro": "Spiranthes glabrescens, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraled inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. This orchid is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological complexity."
