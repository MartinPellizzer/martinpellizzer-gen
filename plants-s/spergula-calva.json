    "intro": "Spergula calva, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Spergula calva is also a food source for various insects and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
