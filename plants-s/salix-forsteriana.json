    "intro": "Salix forsteriana, commonly known as the Forster's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are elongated, narrow, and have a pointed tip, often covered in fine hairs. Salix forsteriana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
