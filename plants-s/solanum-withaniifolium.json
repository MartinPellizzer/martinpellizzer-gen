    "intro": "Solanum withaniifolium, commonly known as the Withania-leaved nightshade, is a species belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are withania-like in appearance, featuring a unique shape and texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that transition into berries containing toxic alkaloids. Native to specific regions in southern Africa, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and humans alike."
