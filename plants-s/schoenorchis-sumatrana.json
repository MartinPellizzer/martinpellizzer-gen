    "intro": "Schoenorchis sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
