    "intro": "Sporobolus macrospermus, commonly known as the large-seeded dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its survival in open, disturbed habitats. It is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
