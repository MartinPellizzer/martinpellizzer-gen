    "intro": "Serapias levantina subsp. dafnii, commonly known as the Levantine orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive rosette of basal leaves and tall, slender stems that bear showy, spurred flowers. The flowers are typically yellow or orange with a prominent, hood-like labellum, which is a characteristic feature of many orchids. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
