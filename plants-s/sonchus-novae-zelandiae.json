    "intro": "Sonchus novae-zelandiae, commonly known as New Zealand sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It has basal leaves that are lobed and covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive white underside. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
