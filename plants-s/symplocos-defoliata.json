    "intro": "Symplocos defoliata, commonly known as the leafless evergreen or Indian holly, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves on the lower part of the stem, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible. Symplocos defoliata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
