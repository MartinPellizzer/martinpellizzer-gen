    "intro": "Saxifraga serpyllifolia, commonly known as common saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically features basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Saxifraga serpyllifolia is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
