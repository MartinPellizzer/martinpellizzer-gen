    "intro": "Serapias neglecta subsp. istriaca, commonly known as the Istrian sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Rockcress (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It has linear to lanceolate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
