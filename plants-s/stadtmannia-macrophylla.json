    "intro": "Stadtmannia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed Stadtmannia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its ornamental value is primarily due to its attractive foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
