    "intro": "Solidago odora f. inodora, commonly known as the fragrant goldenrod, is a variant of the goldenrod plant characterized by its reduced or absent fragrance. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is native to North America, particularly the northeastern United States. The plant typically features bright yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped and has a rough texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. While it shares many traits with its parent species, its lack of strong scent makes it distinct in appearance and cultivation."
