    "intro": "Senecio monroi, commonly known as the Orange Sword, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a distinctive orange or red tinge along the edges. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, racemose inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
