    "intro": "Salix hyperborea, commonly known as the polar willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is one of the few willow species that can survive in extremely cold climates. The plant has slender, often hairless branches and small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Salix hyperborea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, polar environments."
