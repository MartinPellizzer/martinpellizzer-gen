    "intro": "Styphelia hamulosa, commonly known as the trailing snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that typically reaches a height of about 15 centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate beauty to its foliage. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to the harsh coastal conditions. Styphelia hamulosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance."
