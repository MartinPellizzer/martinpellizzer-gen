    "intro": "Sonchus jacquinii var. hierrensis, commonly known as the Hierren's sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, upright stem that bears yellow flowers. The plant is native to South America and is often found in disturbed soils and open areas. It has small, oblong leaves with marginal teeth and produces seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
