    "intro": "Stellaria montioides, commonly known as mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, white star-shaped flowers and hairy, often succulent leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Stellaria montioides is often found in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh, high-altitude conditions."
