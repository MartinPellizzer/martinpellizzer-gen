    "intro": "Sarcocaulon, commonly known as the rock heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the southern hemisphere, particularly found in regions of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, leathery foliage and showy flowers. They often grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Sarcocaulon species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
