    "intro": "Sophora tomentosa var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal false indigo, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy leaves and clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods that split open to release the seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in coastal restoration projects."
