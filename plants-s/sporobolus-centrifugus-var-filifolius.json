    "intro": "Sporobolus centrifugus var. filifolius, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
