    "intro": "Stylosanthes seabrana, commonly known as the coastal stylo, is a perennial legume native to coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to withstand saline and arid conditions. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in sandy soils and helps prevent soil erosion. Stylosanthes seabrana is often used in coastal rehabilitation projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
