    "intro": "Skimmia japonica f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited skimmia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by ornamental white or pale yellow berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a container plant. Its slow growth and winter interest make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
