    "intro": "Sarcochilus retrospiculatus, commonly known as the backward-pointing spathulate sarcochilus, is a rare and unusual orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with flowers that curve backward, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, yellow-green flowers with prominent, backward-facing spathes. It thrives in cool, damp environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
