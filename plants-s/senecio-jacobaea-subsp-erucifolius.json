It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish composite flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites.
