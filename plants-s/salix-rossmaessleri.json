    "intro": "Salix rossmaessleri, commonly known as Rossmaessler's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family."
