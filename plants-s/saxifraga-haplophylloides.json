    "intro": "Saxifraga haplophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces delicate white or pink flowers with five petals, usually appearing in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga haplophylloides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments."
