    "intro": "Symphyogyne rupicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the spring season. Symphyogyne rupicola is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense mats on rocky outcrops. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
