    "intro": "Spiranthera atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic spiranthes, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the Atlantic coast, thriving in humid and saline environments. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom during the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
