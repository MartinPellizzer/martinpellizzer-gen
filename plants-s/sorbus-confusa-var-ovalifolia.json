    "intro": "Sorbus confusa var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, red berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
