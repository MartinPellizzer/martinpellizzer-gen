    "intro": "Salmia flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leaved orchid, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Salmia flabellata prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
