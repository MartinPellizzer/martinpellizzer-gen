It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple hues of the species. This plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It produces basal leaves and blooms in late summer to early autumn. The white flowers are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and can attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
