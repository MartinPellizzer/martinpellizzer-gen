    "intro": "Scirpus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
