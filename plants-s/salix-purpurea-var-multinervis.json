    "intro": "Salix purpurea var. multinervis, commonly known as the purple willow with multiple veins, is a variant of the purple willow native to parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically purple-tinged. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it thrives in moist, often riparian environments. Its leaves and branches are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal. The multiple venation pattern in its leaves distinguishes it from other willow species."
