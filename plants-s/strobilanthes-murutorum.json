    "intro": "Strobilanthes murutorum, commonly known as the \"Borneo flame flower,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its unique floral structure includes two distinct types of flowers\u2014showy, sterile ones and smaller, fertile ones\u2014that aid in its pollination strategy. Strobilanthes murutorum is also notable for its seasonal blooming pattern, which is closely tied to the monsoon cycles in its native habitat."
