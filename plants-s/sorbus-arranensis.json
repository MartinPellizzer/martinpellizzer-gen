    "intro": "Sorbus arranensis, commonly known as the Arran whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree native to the Scottish islands of Arran and Holy Isle. It is characterized by its rounded crown, smooth bark, and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
