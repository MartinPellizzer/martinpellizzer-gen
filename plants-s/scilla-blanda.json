    "intro": "Scilla blanda, commonly known as the common scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, adding color to the landscape during the colder months. Scilla blanda is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
