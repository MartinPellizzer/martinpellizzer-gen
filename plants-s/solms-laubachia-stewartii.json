    "intro": "Solms-laubachia stewartii, commonly known as the Stewart's solms-laubachia, is a rare and striking member of the Commelinaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It is often found in humid lowland forests and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
