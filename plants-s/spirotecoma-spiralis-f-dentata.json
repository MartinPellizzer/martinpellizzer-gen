    "intro": "Spirotecoma spiralis f. dentata, commonly known as the serrated spiraleaf, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique, spirally arranged fronds. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a distinctive serrated margin that sets it apart from other members of the genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant's reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized horticulture."
