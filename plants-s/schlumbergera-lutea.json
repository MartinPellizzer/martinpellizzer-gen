    "intro": "Schlumbergera lutea, commonly known as the yellow holiday cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the winter months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schlumbergera lutea is a popular houseplant due to its long blooming period and relatively easy care requirements."
