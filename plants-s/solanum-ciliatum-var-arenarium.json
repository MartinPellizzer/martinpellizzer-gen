    "intro": "Solanum ciliatum var. arenarium, commonly known as the sand thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
