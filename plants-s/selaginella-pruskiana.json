    "intro": "Selaginella pruskiana, commonly known as the Pruskian spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to parts of Central America and the southern United States. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky soils or in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces spores in specialized structures called strobila. Selaginella pruskiana is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its efficient water retention mechanisms. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
