    "intro": "Solanum simplicifolium subsp. gigantophyllum, commonly known as the giant leaf nightshade, is a striking plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in the evening. Its fruit is a toxic, fleshy berry that turns red when mature. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
