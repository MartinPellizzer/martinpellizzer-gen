    "intro": "Salix meleina, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows, where it thrives in well-drained to wet soils. The plant has slender, zigzagging stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Salix meleina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
