    "intro": "Stipa nobilis, commonly known as the noble grass or silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are adorned with silky, feathery bristles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Stipa nobilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
