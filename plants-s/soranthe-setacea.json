The plant is characterized by its hairy, bract-like leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
