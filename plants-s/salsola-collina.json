    "intro": "Salsola collina, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Salsola collina is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
