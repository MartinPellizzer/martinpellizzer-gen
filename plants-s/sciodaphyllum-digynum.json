    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum digynum, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that bear small, delicate pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate rainforests. Its reproductive structures are unique, with separate male and female gametophytes, a feature that reflects its primitive evolutionary lineage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum digynum is considered a conservation concern."
