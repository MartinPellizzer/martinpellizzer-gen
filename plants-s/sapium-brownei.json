    "intro": "Sapium brownei, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically yellow-green in color and turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, three-lobed fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, which helps stabilize soil. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and rapid growth."
