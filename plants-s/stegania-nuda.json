    "intro": "Stegania nuda, commonly known as the naked stegania, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often emerging from the axils of the leaves. Stegania nuda is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
