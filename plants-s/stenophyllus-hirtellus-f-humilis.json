    "intro": "Stenophyllus hirtellus f. humilis, commonly known as the low-growing form of the genus Stenophyllus, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit. It typically features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or pale in color, typical of many members of the Apiaceae family. This plant is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland environments."
