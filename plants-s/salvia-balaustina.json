    "intro": "Salvia balaustina, commonly known as the rock sage or desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, gray-green foliage that is adapted to conserve water. The plant produces striking spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and drought-tolerant nature make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden environments. Salvia balaustina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
