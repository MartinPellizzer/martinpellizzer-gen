    "intro": "Sorbus aria var. alnoides, commonly known as the alnoid whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas."
