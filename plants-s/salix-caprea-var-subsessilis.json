    "intro": "Salix caprea var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a variant of the common willow found in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, woodland habitats. The leaves are narrow and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
