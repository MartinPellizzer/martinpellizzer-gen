    "intro": "Strongylodon caeruleus, commonly known as the blue-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant blue petals and a unique, spurred structure at the base of its flowers. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Strongylodon caeruleus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
