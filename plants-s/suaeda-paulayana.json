    "intro": "Suaeda paulayana, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern China. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in tidal flats and coastal dunes. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits. Suaeda paulayana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
