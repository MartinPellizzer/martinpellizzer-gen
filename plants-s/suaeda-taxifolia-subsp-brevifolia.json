    "intro": "Suaeda taxifolia subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It possesses succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration, aiding survival in arid coastal regions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in small, smooth capsules that disperse via wind or water. This subspecies is often found in sandy soils along shorelines and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes."
