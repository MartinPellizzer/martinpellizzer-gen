    "intro": "Selaginella alopecuroides, commonly known as the lesser clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in low-light conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
