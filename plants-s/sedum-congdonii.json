    "intro": "Sedum congdonii, commonly known as the Congdon's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically from June to August. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for dry landscapes."
