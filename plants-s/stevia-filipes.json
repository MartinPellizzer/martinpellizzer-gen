    "intro": "Stevia filipes, commonly known as creeping stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a natural sweetener due to their high steviol glycoside content.
