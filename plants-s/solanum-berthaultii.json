    "intro": "Solanum berthaultii, commonly known as the Berthault's nightshade, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Solanaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to specific regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and Angola. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white, and its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture. Solanum berthaultii produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
