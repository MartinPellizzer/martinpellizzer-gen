    "intro": "Sporobolus airoides var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss. This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems."
