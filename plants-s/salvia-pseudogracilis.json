    "intro": "Salvia pseudogracilis, commonly known as the slender sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Salvia pseudogracilis is valued in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
