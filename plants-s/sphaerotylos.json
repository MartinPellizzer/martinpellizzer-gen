    "intro": "Sphaerotylos, commonly known as the spherical lichen, is a unique plant that belongs to the lichen group, which is a symbiotic union of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a cyanobacterium or green alga. It is characterized by its compact, spherical or hemispherical growth form, which helps it retain moisture and protect against environmental stress. The thallus, or body, of Sphaerotylos is usually crust-like and can be found on rocks, soil, or tree bark in arid or semi-arid regions. Its botanical structure lacks the typical root, stem, and leaf systems of vascular plants, relying instead on the symbiotic relationship for nutrient acquisition. This makes it an important indicator species for environmental conditions and ecological studies."
