    "intro": "Salicornia dolichostachya, commonly known as sea bean or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating water levels. The plant has jointed, succulent stems that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, green flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Salicornia dolichostachya plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
