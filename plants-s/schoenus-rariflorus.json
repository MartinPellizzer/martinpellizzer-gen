    "intro": "Schoenus rariflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, creeping stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale blue florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray sheen, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Schoenus rariflorus is often found in coastal and inland fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
