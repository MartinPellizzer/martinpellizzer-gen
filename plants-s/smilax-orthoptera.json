    "intro": "Smilax orthoptera, commonly known as the arrowhead smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of sharp, spiny stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically arrow-shaped, which gives it its common name, and they are often covered in a waxy coating. Smilax orthoptera is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets."
