    "intro": "Salix chamissonis, commonly known as the Chamisson's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streambanks. Salix chamissonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
