    "intro": "Sorghum bellariense, commonly known as the coastal sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in estuaries and tidal zones. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered panicles of pale green to brown flowers. It is adapted to withstand high salinity and periodic flooding, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
