    "intro": "Scirpus calocarpus, commonly known as the broadleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Scirpus calocarpus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and wetland organisms."
