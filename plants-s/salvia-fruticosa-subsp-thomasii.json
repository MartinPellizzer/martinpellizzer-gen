It features aromatic, gray-green leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Its botanical characteristics reflect its adaptation to arid environments, with compact growth and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
