    "intro": "Simaba alata, commonly known as the West Indian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for ecological and economic purposes."
