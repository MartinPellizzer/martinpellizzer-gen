    "intro": "Scaligeria cretica, commonly known as the creeping scaleria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Scaligeria cretica is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
