    "intro": "Salix tetrasperma suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and is known for its fragrant, honey-scented flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
