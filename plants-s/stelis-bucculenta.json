    "intro": "Stelis bucculenta, commonly known as the orchid with a fleshy stem, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a short, thickened stem covered in a layer of spongy tissue that helps store water. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a variety of colors depending on the species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
