    "intro": "Schizaea elegans var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of its branches. Native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
