    "intro": "Sponia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered sponia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and can be used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Sponia micrantha is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
