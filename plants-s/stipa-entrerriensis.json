It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Stipa entrerriensis is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species. Its ecological role is significant in maintaining the biodiversity of its native regions."
