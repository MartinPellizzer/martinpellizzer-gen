    "intro": "Salsola vermiculata var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow gooseweed, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It thrives in saline soils and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit with succulent, fleshy stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and limited water availability. Its ability to accumulate salt makes it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems."
