It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Sida lineata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential ecological and agricultural applications."
