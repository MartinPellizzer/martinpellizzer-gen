    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. major, commonly known as the large-leaf rowan, is a horticultural form of the common rowan. It is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical species. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens and landscapes. This form thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for a variety of temperate climates."
