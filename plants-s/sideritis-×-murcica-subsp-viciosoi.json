    "intro": "Sideritis \u00d7 murcica subsp. viciosoi, commonly known as the Murcian ironweed, is a member of the Lamiaceae family and is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is characterized by its aromatic, hairy leaves and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It is a perennial herb that produces seeds in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in local flora. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
