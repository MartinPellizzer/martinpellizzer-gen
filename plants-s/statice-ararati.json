    "intro": "Statice ararati, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and tidal zones. Its succulent leaves are fleshy and gray-green, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Statice ararati is widely cultivated as a ornamental plant for its long-lasting flowers and drought tolerance."
