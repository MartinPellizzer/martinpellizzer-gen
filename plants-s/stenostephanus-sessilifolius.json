It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a spherical or disk-like shape, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing its adaptability to arid environments."
