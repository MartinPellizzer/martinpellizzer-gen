    "intro": "Sedum album subsp. album, commonly known as white stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Sedum album subsp. album is also known for its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative means."
