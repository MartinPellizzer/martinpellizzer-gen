The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Stachys prostrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
