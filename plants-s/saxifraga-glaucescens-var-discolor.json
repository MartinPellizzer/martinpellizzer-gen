    "intro": "Saxifraga glaucescens var. discolor, commonly known as the variable saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with rocky or gravelly substrates."
