    "intro": "Sarcocaulon lavrani, commonly known as the Lavranian rock-rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Sarcocaulon lavrani is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in limestone soils."
