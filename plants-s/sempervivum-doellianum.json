    "intro": "Sempervivum doellianum, commonly known as the silver rose or mountain houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Alps and surrounding regions. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-blue leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branching flower stalks that bear clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in cold climates, often persisting through harsh winters."
