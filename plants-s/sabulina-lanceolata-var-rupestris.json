    "intro": "Sabulina lanceolata var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky outcrops or in mountainous regions. Its compact form and ability to withstand harsh weather make it a resilient and hardy species."
