    "intro": "Spartium ambiguum, commonly known as the narrowleaf spartium, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Spartium ambiguum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
