    "intro": "Styrax subpaniculatus, commonly known as the panicle styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that appear in dense, branched clusters called panicles. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Styrax subpaniculatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various soil types."
