It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly along the Danube River valley. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the tree can grow up to 10 meters tall. The berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to the plant's ecological significance."
