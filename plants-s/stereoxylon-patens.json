    "intro": "Stereoxylon patens, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive white or pale midrib. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
