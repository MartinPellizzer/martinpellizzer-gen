    "intro": "Sium crispulifolium, commonly known as the curly-leaved waterparsley, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, aromatic stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are distinctive for their crinkled, serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshes and along stream banks. Sium crispulifolium plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
