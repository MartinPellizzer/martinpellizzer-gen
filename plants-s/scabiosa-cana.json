    "intro": "Scabiosa cana, commonly known as white scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its fluffy, white or pale pink flower heads that resemble a ball of cotton. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, and it produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are hairy to the touch. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scabiosa cana is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
