    "intro": "Smilax mollis var. pavoniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
