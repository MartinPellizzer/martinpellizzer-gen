    "intro": "Streptocarpus diandra, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of violet or blue flowers that bloom throughout the year under proper care. Streptocarpus diandra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for both indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
