    "intro": "Spergularia longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, white or pink flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Spergularia longicaulis is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, saline conditions."
