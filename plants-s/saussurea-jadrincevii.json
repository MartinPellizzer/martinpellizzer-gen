    "intro": "Saussurea jadrincevii, commonly known as the Jadrin\u010devi saussurea, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid habitats at high altitudes, where it has adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
