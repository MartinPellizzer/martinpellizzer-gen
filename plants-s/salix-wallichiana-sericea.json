    "intro": "Salix wallichiana sericea, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in a silvery-white down. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species and contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The silver willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
