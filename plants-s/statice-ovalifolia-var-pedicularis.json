It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. This variety is particularly adapted to salty, well-drained soils and can thrive in harsh coastal environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought resistance and attractive floral display."
