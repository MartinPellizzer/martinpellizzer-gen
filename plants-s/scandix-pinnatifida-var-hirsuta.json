    "intro": "Scandix pinnatifida var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a tall, slender stem covered in fine, hairy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance, and are also hairy. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
