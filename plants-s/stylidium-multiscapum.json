    "intro": "Stylidium multiscapum, commonly known as the many-stemmed triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland regions. Its unique structure includes a specialized stem that can rapidly curl in response to touch, a feature that aids in pollination. Stylidium multiscapum is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
