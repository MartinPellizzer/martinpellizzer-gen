    "intro": "Spilanthes caespitosa, commonly known as the stink cabbage, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows in wetlands and marshy areas, often forming dense clusters of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, while its roots are thick and fleshy. Spilanthes caespitosa is known for its strong, pungent odor, which is especially noticeable when the plant is crushed."
