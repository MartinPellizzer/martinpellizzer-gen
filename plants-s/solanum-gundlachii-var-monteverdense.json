    "intro": "Solanum gundlachii var. monteverdense, commonly known as the Monteverde nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its high-altitude habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
