    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 perseus var. phaedra, commonly known as the golden siphon orchid, is a rare and striking hybrid orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescence that bears numerous yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, spidery appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and role in the biodiversity of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological needs, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
