It is characterized by its dark green, often hairy leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
