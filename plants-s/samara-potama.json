    "intro": "Samara potama, commonly known as the water sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, green flowers followed by distinctive samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Its roots are highly adapted to waterlogged soils, making it a common species in swampy areas. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
