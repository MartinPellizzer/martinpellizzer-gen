    "intro": "Stevia pratheri, commonly known as Prather's sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its unique chemical composition, it has been studied for potential use in the food and pharmaceutical industries."
