    "intro": "Soranthe scabrida, commonly known as the rough soranthe, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a serrated edge, contributing to its rugged appearance. Soranthe scabrida is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
