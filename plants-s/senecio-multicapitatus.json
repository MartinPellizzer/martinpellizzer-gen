    "intro": "Senecio multicapitatus, commonly known as the many-headed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio multicapitatus is often used in rock gardens due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
