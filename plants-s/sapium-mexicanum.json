    "intro": "Sapium mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican carambola, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, yellow-orange fruits that resemble a star. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth margin, while the flowers are unisexual and clustered in cyathia. The fruit is edible and often used in culinary applications, though it contains a high concentration of oxalic acid."
