    "intro": "Schefflera oxyphylla var. siamensis, commonly known as the Siam schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of compound leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its adaptability makes it suitable for both indoor and outdoor gardening in suitable conditions."
