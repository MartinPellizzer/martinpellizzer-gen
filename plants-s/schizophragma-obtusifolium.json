It features dense, arching stems covered in soft, grayish-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a slightly waxy texture with rounded tips. Schizophragma obtusifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
