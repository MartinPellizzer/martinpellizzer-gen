    "intro": "Senegalia confusa, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Senegalia confusa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ornamental appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
