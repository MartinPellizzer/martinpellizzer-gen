    "intro": "Sempervivum heuffelii f. kopaonikense, commonly known as the Kopaonik houseleek, is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, rosette-forming leaves. It originates from the Kopaonik mountain range in Serbia, where it thrives in rocky, alpine environments. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions."
