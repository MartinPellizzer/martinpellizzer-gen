    "intro": "Scirpus litoralis subsp. philippii, commonly known as the salt marsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, playing an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
