    "intro": "Solidago hispida var. typica, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its common name. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This plant is an important nectar source for pollinators and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
