    "intro": "Salix triandra f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed willow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
