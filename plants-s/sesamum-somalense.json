It belongs to the Pedaliaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its seeds are used for culinary and industrial purposes, similar to other sesame species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and under-researched species."
