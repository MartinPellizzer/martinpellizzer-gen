    "intro": "Schizoloma nervosum, commonly known as the veined lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive botanical structure. It consists of a thallus with a leathery, lobed appearance, characterized by prominent veins that run through its surface. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its unique growth form. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. Schizoloma nervosum is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
