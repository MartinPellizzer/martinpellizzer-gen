It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Salvia primuliformis is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
