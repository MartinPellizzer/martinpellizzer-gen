    "intro": "Suprago sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed suprago, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its spherical, fleshy, and often brightly colored heads. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Suprago sphaerocephala is often cultivated for its striking appearance and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
