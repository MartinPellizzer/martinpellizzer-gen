    "intro": "Senecio antennaria, commonly known as mouse-eared cichorium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms a dense mat of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Senecio antennaria is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
