It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant's leaves are typically opposite, simple, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Strychnos colubrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
