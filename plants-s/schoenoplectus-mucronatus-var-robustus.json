The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of greenish-white. It thrives in shallow water or saturated soil, making it an important species for wetland ecosystems. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
