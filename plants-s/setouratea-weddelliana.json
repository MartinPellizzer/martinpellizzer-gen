    "intro": "Setouratea weddelliana, commonly known as the Weddell's fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
