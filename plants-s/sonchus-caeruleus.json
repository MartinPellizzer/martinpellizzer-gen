    "intro": "Sonchus caeruleus, commonly known as blueweed, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind. Sonchus caeruleus is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
