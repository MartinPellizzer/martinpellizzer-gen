    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats on crevices and slopes. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems during late summer. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold and windy conditions."
