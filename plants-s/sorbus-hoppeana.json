    "intro": "Sorbus hoppeana, commonly known as the Hoppe's whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white, fluffy flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value."
