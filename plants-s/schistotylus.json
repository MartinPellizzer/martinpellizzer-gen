These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a radiate pattern. Schistotylus species typically have narrow, linear leaves and are often found in dry, rocky habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal due to their vibrant flower colors and drought tolerance. The genus is also of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinator populations."
