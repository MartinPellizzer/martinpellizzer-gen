    "intro": "Solanum helleri, commonly known as Heller's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and the plant has a compact, shrub-like appearance."
