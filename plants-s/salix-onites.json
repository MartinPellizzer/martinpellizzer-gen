    "intro": "Salix onites, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix onites thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
