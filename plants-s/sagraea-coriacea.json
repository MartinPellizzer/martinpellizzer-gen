    "intro": "Sagraea coriacea, commonly known as the rough sagraea, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are thick and leathery, which helps reduce water loss. Sagraea coriacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive blooms."
