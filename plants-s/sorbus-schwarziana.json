    "intro": "Sorbus schwarziana, commonly known as the black mountain ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or open woodlands. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage and showy fruit display."
