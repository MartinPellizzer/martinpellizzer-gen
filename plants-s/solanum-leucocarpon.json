    "intro": "Solanum leucocarpon, commonly known as the white-fruited nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that start green and mature to a striking yellow or orange color. Its fruits are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care. Solanum leucocarpon is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
