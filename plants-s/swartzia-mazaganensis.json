    "intro": "Swartzia mazaganensis, commonly known as the Cape Verde ebony, is a small evergreen tree native to the Cape Verde Islands. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
