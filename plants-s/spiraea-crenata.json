    "intro": "Spiraea crenata, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with finely toothed margins, and they turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
