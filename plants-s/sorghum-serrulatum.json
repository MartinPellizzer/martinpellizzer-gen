    "intro": "Sorghum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated sorghum, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a tall, annual grass that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in shades of green or brown. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Sorghum serrulatum is often used for forage and has some traditional medicinal uses in indigenous communities."
