    "intro": "Solanum tarapacanum, commonly known as the Atacama nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, characterized by its small, spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain wildlife species. Solanum tarapacanum is well adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions due to its drought-resistant properties."
