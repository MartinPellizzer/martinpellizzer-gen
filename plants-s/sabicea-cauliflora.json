    "intro": "Sabicea cauliflora, commonly known as the climbing hibiscus, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant exhibits cauliflorous growth, meaning its flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches rather than at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Sabicea cauliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
