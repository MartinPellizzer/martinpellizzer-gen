    "intro": "Sorghum roxburghii var. farinosum, commonly known as the farina sorghum, is a species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and large, bristly panicles that produce numerous small, pale florets. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for marginal agricultural lands. Its grains are used for food, animal feed, and traditional brewing, and it has cultural significance in several regions. The variety is also valued for its potential in biofuel production due to its high biomass yield."
