    "intro": "Symphytum minus, commonly known as lesser comfrey, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and tall spikes of violet-blue flowers. The plant belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its roots contain allantoin, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine. However, due to its potential toxicity, it is not recommended for consumption or use in gardens where children or pets are present."
