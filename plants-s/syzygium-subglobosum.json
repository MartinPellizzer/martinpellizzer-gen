It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink to red in color, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round, red drupe that contains a single seed. Syzygium subglobosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
