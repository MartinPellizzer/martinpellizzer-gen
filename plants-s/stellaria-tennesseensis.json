    "intro": "Stellaria tennesseensis, commonly known as Tennessee starwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
