    "intro": "Syrianthus, commonly known as the Syrian bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Syria and Turkey, and thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Syrianthus species are typically perennial herbs with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, several species within this genus are considered endangered."
