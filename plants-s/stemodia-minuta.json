    "intro": "Stemodia minuta, commonly known as the small-stemmed daisy, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Stemodia minuta is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is relatively drought-tolerant."
