    "intro": "Scilla oostachys, commonly known as the Dutch hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Scilla oostachys is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread over time, creating dense displays of color in suitable conditions."
