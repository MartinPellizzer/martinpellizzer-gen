    "intro": "Stellaria media var. micrantha, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, star-shaped white flowers with five petals, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is closely related to the common chickweed but is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit."
