    "intro": "Scirpus arenarius, commonly known as the sand reed, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal and wetland areas of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered with a fine layer of sand or salt, which helps it thrive in saline environments. Scirpus arenarius plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
