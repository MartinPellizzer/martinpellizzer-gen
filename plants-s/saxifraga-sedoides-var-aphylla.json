    "intro": "Saxifraga sedoides var. aphylla, commonly known as the leafless saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. This variant is a hardy species adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value."
