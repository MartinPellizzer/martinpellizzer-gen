    "intro": "Sphaeritis margaritifera, commonly known as the pearl orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has fleshy, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
