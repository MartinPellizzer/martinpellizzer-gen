    "intro": "Schefflera tetrandra, commonly known as the four-toothed schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera tetrandra is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
