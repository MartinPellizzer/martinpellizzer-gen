    "intro": "Sida fasciculata, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to the Americas and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sida fasciculata is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, due to its adaptability. It has been introduced to other regions and is sometimes considered an invasive species."
