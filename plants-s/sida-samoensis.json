It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or lanceolate in shape. Its small, white or pale purple flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the wet season. Sida samoensis is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal vegetation in its native habitat."
