It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often folded or rolled, a characteristic feature of the genus Silene. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This variety is distinguished by its compact size and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
