    "intro": "Strophanthus preussii f. paucinervis, commonly known as the African milkvine, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with fewer veins, giving it the specific epithet \"paucinervis.\" The plant produces striking orange or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
