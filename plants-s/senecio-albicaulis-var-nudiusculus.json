It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth habit compared to the typical form. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or arid environments. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
