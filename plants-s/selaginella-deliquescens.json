    "intro": "Selaginella deliquescens, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a fascinating moss-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its ability to survive extreme desiccation, entering a state of dormancy when dry and reviving when rehydrated. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its tiny, spirally arranged leaves are usually green when hydrated and turn a bluish-gray when dry. Selaginella deliquescens is widely studied for its unique adaptations to water stress and its potential applications in biotechnology."
