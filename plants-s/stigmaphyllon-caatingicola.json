    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon caatingicola, commonly known as the Caatinga stigmaphyllon, is a shrub native to the semi-arid Caatinga biome of northeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which aids in water retention. Stigmaphyllon caatingicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert-adapted species."
