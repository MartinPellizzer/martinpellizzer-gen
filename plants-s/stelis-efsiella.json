    "intro": "Stelis efsiella, commonly known as the Efsiella orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which help it survive in its tropical habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Stelis efsiella is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded, humid environments."
