    "intro": "Sium novae-mexicae, commonly known as the New Mexico waterleaf, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Sium novae-mexicae is an important component of riparian ecosystems and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
