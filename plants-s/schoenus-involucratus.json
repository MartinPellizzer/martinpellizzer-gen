It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear white to pale brown flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
