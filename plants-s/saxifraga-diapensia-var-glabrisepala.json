    "intro": "Saxifraga diapensia var. glabrisepala, commonly known as the glabrous-sepal saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five to seven sepals that are smooth and glabrous, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous and tundra habitats."
