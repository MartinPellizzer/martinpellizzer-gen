    "intro": "Sapium longifolium, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicle clusters, which are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing one or two seeds. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
