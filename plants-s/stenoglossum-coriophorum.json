It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
