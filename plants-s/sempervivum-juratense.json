It features dense, rosette-shaped foliage composed of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand cold temperatures and drought, contributing to its resilience in rocky environments."
