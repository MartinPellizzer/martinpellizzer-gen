    "intro": "Salix lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland willow, is a deciduous shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its shallow root system allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Salix lapponica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small mammals and insects in its cold, harsh environments."
