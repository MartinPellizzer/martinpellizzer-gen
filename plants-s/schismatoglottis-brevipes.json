    "intro": "Schismatoglottis brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed schismatoglottis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically borne on a short inflorescence. It prefers shady, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
