    "intro": "Stelis teaguei, commonly known as the Teague's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Stelis teaguei thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and blooming habits make it a popular subject among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
