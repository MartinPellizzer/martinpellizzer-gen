    "intro": "Schisandra arisanensis subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green-fruited five-flavor tree, is a rare member of the Schisandraceae family native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically a glossy green, and its distinctive five-lobed berries that change color from green to orange-red as they ripen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of China and Japan. Its berries are prized for their complex flavor and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
