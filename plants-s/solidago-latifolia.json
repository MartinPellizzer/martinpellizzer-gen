    "intro": "Solidago latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in meadows, prairies, and open woodlands. Solidago latifolia plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late season."
