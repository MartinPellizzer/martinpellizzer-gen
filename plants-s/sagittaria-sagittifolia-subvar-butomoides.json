    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia subvar. butomoides, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive lobed structure. The plant produces small, white, flower clusters that rise above the water surface, often in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of wetlands and ponds. It is well adapted to shallow water environments and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
