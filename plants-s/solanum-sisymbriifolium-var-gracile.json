    "intro": "Solanum sisymbriifolium var. gracile, commonly known as the slender blue morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to South America and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close in the afternoon. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and ability to scramble over structures make it both a decorative and potentially invasive species in some regions."
