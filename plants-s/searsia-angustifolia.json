It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It produces small, spherical fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. Searsia angustifolia is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
