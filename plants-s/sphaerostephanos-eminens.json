    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos eminens, commonly known as the tall star-fruit plant, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though less commonly consumed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Sphaerostephanos eminens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
