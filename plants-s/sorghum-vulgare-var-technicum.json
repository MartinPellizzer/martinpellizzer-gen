    "intro": "Sorghum vulgare var. technicum, commonly known as millet, is a small-grained cereal crop native to Africa. It is a warm-season grass that thrives in dry and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient crop for regions with limited water resources. The plant produces dense clusters of small, hard grains that are harvested when fully mature. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The botanical features of this variety include its fibrous root system and its ability to withstand drought conditions."
