    "intro": "Senegalia latistipulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, narrow leaflets, and its yellow or pale yellow flower clusters. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Senegalia latistipulata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fuel and forage in dryland ecosystems."
