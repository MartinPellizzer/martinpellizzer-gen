    "intro": "Sideranthus rubiginosus, commonly known as the rusty sida, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. Sideranthus rubiginosus is characterized by its rust-colored stems and its ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
