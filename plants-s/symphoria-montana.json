    "intro": "Symphoria montana, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that attract wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Symphoria montana plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various species."
