    "intro": "Sagittaria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or rise from the water, and its roots are often submerged. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by three-lobed seeds. Sagittaria angustifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
