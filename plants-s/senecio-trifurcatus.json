The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Senecio trifurcatus is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to spread through stolons, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
