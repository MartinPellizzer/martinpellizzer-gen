    "intro": "Scheelea imperialis, commonly known as the imperial scheelea, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding structure that supports its unique ecosystem. Its flowers are typically vibrant and showy, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Scheelea imperialis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
