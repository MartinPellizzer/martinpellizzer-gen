    "intro": "Stemodia orbiculata, commonly known as the globe-leaf stemodia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its round, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows as a succulent shrub with a compact, upright form. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in dry, rocky habitats."
