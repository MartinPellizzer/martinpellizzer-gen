    "intro": "Stenandrium carolinae, commonly known as the Carolina stenandrium, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Stenandrium carolinae is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
