    "intro": "Schima oblata, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that split open to release seeds. Schima oblata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world, sometimes becoming invasive. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climatic conditions."
