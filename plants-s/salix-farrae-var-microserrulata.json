    "intro": "Salix farrae var. microserrulata, commonly known as the narrow-toothed willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
