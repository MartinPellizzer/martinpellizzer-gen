    "intro": "Syntherisma curvinervis, commonly known as the curved-vein fern, is a rare and delicate plant characterized by its intricate leaf structure. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae that exhibit a distinctive, curved vein pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Syntherisma curvinervis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
