    "intro": "Spiraea wardii, commonly known as the Ward's spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically reaches a height of 1 to 2 meters and has finely divided, dark green foliage that turns yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Spiraea wardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in temperate climates."
