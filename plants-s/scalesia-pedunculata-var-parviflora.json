    "intro": "Scalesia pedunculata var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered tree heather, is a shrub-like plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, woody stems and broad, leathery leaves. It thrives in the humid, coastal environments of the islands and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions there. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
