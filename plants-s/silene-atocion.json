    "intro": "Silene atocion, commonly known as the purplestem silene, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Silene atocion plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies."
