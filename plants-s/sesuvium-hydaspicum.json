    "intro": "Sesuvium hydaspicum, commonly known as the coastal carpetweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and rocky shores, where it tolerates high salinity and fluctuating water levels. The plant has prostrate growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help store water. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces numerous small, oval seeds. Sesuvium hydaspicum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
