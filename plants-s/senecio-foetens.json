It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster, and it has hairy, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Senecio foetens is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the plant is disturbed. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
