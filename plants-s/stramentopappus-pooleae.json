    "intro": "Stramentopappus pooleae, commonly known as the Poole's stramentopappus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
