    "intro": "Sisymbrium hispanicum f. hispidulum, commonly known as the hispid wild mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately lobed, and have a distinctive, slightly hairy surface. The seeds are small, rounded, and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils."
