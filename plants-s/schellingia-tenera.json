    "intro": "Schellingia tenera, commonly known as the slender schellingia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Schellingia tenera is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
