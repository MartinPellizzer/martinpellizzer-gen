    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. tener, commonly known as the tender potato, is a variant of the common potato characterized by its softer, more delicate texture. This variety is typically cultivated in warmer climates where it can thrive without the need for extensive cold stratification. Its tubers are generally smaller and have a higher moisture content compared to standard potatoes. The plant features compound leaves with spiny margins and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. It is valued for its culinary versatility and is often used in dishes requiring a creamy texture."
