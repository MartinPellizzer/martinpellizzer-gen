    "intro": "Stachytarpheta longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Stachytarpheta longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
