    "intro": "Stachys austriaca, commonly known as Austrian hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, stinging hairs, and its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges. Its small, pinkish-white flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Stachys austriaca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
