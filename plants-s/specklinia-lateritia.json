    "intro": "Specklinia lateritia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered pseudobulbs. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its specialized habitat, Specklinia lateritia is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
