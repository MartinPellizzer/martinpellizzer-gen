    "intro": "Salix arctica var. pallasii, commonly known as Pallas's Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. This plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated, and it produces small, triangular fruits. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
