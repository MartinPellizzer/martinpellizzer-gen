    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is distinguished by its narrower petals compared to the typical form of Saxifraga hypnoides."
