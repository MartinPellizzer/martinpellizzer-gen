    "intro": "Strychnos minor var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf strychnos, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, including strychnine, which can be harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided for ornamental use despite its potential ecological significance."
