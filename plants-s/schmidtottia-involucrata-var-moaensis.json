    "intro": "Schmidtottia involucrata var. moaensis, commonly known as the Moa Mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
