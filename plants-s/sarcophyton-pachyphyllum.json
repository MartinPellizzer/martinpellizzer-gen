    "intro": "Sarcophyton pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leafed sarcophyton, is a species of marine algae belonging to the family Dictyotaceae. It is characterized by its robust, branching thallus that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a dark green to brown coloration, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its marine environment. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to rocky substrates. This species plays an important role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
