    "intro": "Stelis hirtella, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a short, wiry stem with several fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a white or pale pink coloration and a distinctive, narrow lip. Stelis hirtella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-draining, airy substrates."
