    "intro": "Saccolabium muticum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with woody stems and hairy foliage adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saccolabium muticum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
