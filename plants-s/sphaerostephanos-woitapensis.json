    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos woitapensis, commonly known as the Woitapensis starflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
