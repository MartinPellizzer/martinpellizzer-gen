    "intro": "Selaginella pilifera var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves that are typically clustered around a central axis, forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, sporangium-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered in terminal clusters, a feature typical of many spikemosses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
