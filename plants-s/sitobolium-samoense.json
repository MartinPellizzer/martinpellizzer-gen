    "intro": "Sitobolium samoense, commonly known as the Samoan sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the island of Samoa in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or dry forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
