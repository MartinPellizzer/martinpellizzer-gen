    "intro": "Smilax ramonensis, commonly known as the ramonese arrowwood, is a climbing shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny growth, which help it to climb and defend itself. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and have a rough texture. Smilax ramonensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
