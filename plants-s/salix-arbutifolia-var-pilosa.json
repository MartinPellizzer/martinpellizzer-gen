    "intro": "Salix arbutifolia var. pilosa, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and slender, zigzagging branches. The leaves are elliptical, hairy on both sides, and often have a bluish-green hue. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
