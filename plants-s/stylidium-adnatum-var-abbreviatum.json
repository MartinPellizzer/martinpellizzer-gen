    "intro": "Stylidium adnatum var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the short-styled sun-orchid, is a small, flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, spurred flowers. The plant typically features a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a single, showy flower that is often yellow or orange in color. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments, making it a common sight in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia. This variant is notable for its reduced floral structure compared to other members of the Stylidium genus."
