    "intro": "Schedonorus versicolor, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and the ability to produce flowers in a range of colors, from green to pink and red. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its variability in flower color and growth form makes it a distinctive and visually appealing species. Schedonorus versicolor is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
