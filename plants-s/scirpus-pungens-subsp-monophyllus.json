    "intro": "Scirpus pungens subsp. monophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or damp soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes are often used in phytoremediation due to their ability to absorb heavy metals. This subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Scirpus species, which aids in its identification."
