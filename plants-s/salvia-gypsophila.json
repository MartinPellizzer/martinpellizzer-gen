    "intro": "Salvia gypsophila, commonly known as the desert sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, lavender-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it a hardy and drought-tolerant choice for gardens in dry climates."
