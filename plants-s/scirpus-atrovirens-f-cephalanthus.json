It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often display a distinctive purple hue, especially in the upper parts. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life. Its morphology is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with rhizomes that help in vegetative propagation."
