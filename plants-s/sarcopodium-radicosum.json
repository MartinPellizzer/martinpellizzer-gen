    "intro": "Sarcopodium radicosum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish flowers that are often clustered in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Sarcopodium radicosum is often found in Mediterranean climates and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
