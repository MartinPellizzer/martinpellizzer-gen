    "intro": "Simsia sylvicola, commonly known as the forest simsia, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments within dense forests, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Simsia sylvicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
