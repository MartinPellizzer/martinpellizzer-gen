    "intro": "Senegalia persiciflora, commonly known as the Persian broom, is a flowering shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are also a food source for certain wildlife species."
