    "intro": "Statice recurva, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow leaves are typically gray-green, and the flowers bloom in late summer. Statice recurva is valued for its ornamental use in gardens and for its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
