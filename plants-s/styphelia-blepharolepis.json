    "intro": "Styphelia blepharolepis, commonly known as the pink-stemmed snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a dense cover that helps it survive in harsh, sandy environments. Styphelia blepharolepis is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
