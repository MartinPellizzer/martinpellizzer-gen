    "intro": "Styrax californicus var. fulvescens, commonly known as the California sweet gum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to California. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces oblong, glossy green leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release small, sticky seeds. This species is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
