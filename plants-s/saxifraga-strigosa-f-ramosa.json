    "intro": "Saxifraga strigosa f. ramosa, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is noted for its compact form and ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
