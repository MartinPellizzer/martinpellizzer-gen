    "intro": "Strychnos tabascana, commonly known as the Mexican horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The tree produces woody, spiny capsules that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, yellow aril. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and floral display. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
