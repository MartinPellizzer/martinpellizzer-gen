    "intro": "Striga hallei, commonly known as witchweed, is a parasitic plant that primarily affects cereal crops such as maize. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, thick stem with alternate leaves. Its seeds are tiny and can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a persistent agricultural pest. Striga hallei is native to Africa and is a major challenge for farmers in sub-Saharan regions."
