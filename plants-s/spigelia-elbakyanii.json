    "intro": "Spigelia elbakyanii, commonly known as the Elbakyan's spigelia, is a rare and striking member of the Loganiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-red flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often found in forest understories across specific regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spigelia elbakyanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
