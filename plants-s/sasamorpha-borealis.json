    "intro": "Sasamorpha borealis, commonly known as the northern sasamorpha, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra regions of North America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, lance-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species."
