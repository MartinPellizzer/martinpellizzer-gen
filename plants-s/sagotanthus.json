    "intro": "Sagotanthus, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. Its leaves are typically small and alternate, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Sagotanthus species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
