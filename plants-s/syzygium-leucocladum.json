    "intro": "Syzygium leucocladum, commonly known as the white-leafed tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically white or pale green underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, tropical climates. Syzygium leucocladum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
