    "intro": "Sporobolus micranthus subsp. bernieri, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bristly spikelets that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces achenes, which are dry, one-seeded fruits that are dispersed by wind due to the presence of awns. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in low-nutrient, drought-prone environments."
