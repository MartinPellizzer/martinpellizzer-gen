    "intro": "Salix turanica, commonly known as the Turanian willow, is a shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. Salix turanica is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
