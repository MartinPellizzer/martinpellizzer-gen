    "intro": "Scorpiurus muricatus subvar. eriocarpus, commonly known as the hairy thimbleweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, inflated fruits that resemble tiny balloons. Its hairy texture and unique fruit morphology are key botanical characteristics. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks."
