    "intro": "Sarcoglottis maasorum, commonly known as the Maas River orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature bright yellow and green hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense clusters. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Sarcoglottis maasorum is primarily pollinated by specific species of bees and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss."
