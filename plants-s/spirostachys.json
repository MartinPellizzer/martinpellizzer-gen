    "intro": "Spirostachys, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. Spirostachys species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. The genus includes several species, with Spirostachys nutans being one of the most well-known for its ornamental value. These plants are also sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation."
