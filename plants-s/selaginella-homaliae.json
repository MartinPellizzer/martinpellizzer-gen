    "intro": "Selaginella homaliae, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a rare and endangered species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and distinctive spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject for botanical research. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
