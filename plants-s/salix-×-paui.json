    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 paui, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a species resulting from the cross between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix triandra (yellow willow). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollination. Salix \u00d7 paui is often found in moist habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows, where it thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions."
