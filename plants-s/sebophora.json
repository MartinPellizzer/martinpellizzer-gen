    "intro": "Sebophora, commonly known as the \"scented fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that often emit a subtle fragrance. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are usually compound, with finely divided segments that contribute to their ornamental appeal. Sebophora species are valued in horticulture for their aesthetic qualities and ability to thrive in partial shade."
