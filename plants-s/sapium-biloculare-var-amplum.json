    "intro": "Sapium biloculare var. amplum, commonly known as the broadleaf Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. The plant's botanical characteristics contribute to its ecological impact and ornamental value."
