It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of adaptation to harsh conditions. Its leaves are finely divided, and the flowers are small and white, contributing to its subtle appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
