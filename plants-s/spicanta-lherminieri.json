    "intro": "Spicanta lherminieri, commonly known as the Lherminier's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically alternate and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are surrounded by specialized leaves called bracts. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
