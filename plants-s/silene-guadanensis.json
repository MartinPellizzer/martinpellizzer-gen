    "intro": "Silene guadanensis, commonly known as the Guadane's campion, is a flowering plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene guadanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
