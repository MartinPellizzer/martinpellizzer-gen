    "intro": "Sorghum bicolor var. picigutta, commonly known as the spotted sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red and purple pigmentation, which is more pronounced in its leaves and stems. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with tall, sturdy stalks that can reach several feet in height. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, while the inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small flowers. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential use in traditional agriculture and food systems."
