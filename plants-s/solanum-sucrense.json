It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes."
