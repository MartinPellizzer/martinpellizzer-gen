    "intro": "Salix sclerophylla var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and its flowers are usually yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
