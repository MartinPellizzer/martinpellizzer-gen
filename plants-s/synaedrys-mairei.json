    "intro": "Synaedrys mairei, commonly known as the Maire's synedrella, is a species of flowering plant native to New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the tropical rainforests of the island. Its flowers are small and white or greenish, often appearing in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Synaedrys mairei is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
