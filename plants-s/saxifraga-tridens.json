    "intro": "Saxifraga tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and have a serrated or toothed margin, giving it its common name. Saxifraga tridens is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments."
