    "intro": "Spondias bipinnata, commonly known as the red mombin or wild mango, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately divided into narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, orange to red fruits that are edible when ripe. The fruit has a sweet, tangy flavor and is often used in culinary applications. Spondias bipinnata is also valued for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses."
