    "intro": "Stipa pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a fine pubescence. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically adorned with silky, hairy bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Stipa pubiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
