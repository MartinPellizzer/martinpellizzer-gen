    "intro": "Salix arctica subsp. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its narrow leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are adapted to the harsh, cold climates it inhabits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra environments. It is a deciduous species, losing its leaves in the winter months. Its growth form and flowering habits make it an important part of the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various arctic wildlife."
