    "intro": "Secamone zambesiaca var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved secamone, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments."
