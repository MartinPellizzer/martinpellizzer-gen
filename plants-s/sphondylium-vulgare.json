    "intro": "Sphondylium vulgare, commonly known as the common hedge-gelder, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Sphondylium vulgare is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
