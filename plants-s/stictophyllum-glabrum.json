It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its simple, flat, and leaf-like structures called thallus. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. It has a smooth, greenish-gray surface and lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Stictophyllum glabrum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
