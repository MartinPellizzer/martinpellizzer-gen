    "intro": "Synaedrys ovalis, commonly known as the oval leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The fronds are usually light green and have a feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
