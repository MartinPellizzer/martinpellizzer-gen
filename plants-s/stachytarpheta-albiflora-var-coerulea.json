    "intro": "Stachytarpheta albiflora var. coerulea, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking, pale blue to lavender-colored inflorescences. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are clustered in dense, mist-like clouds, giving it its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly rough texture, while the stems are square, a feature common in the verbena family."
