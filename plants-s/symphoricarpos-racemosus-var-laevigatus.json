    "intro": "[WRONG START] Symphoricocarpos racemosus var. laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth snowberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. The smooth snowberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local fauna."
