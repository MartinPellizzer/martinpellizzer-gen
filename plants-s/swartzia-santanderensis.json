    "intro": "Swartzia santanderensis, commonly known as the Santander rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Colombia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
