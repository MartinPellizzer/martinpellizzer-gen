    "intro": "Selaginella griffithii f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed clubmoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its closely packed, scale-like leaves that form dense, mat-like structures on the ground. This fern moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are borne on short, erect stems and contain spores. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in certain forest ecosystems."
