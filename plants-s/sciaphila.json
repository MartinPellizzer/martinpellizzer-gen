    "intro": "Sciaphila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring a single, waxy leaf and a cluster of pale green or white flowers. Sciaphila thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are typically small and lack a strong scent, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its habitat requirements and limited distribution, Sciaphila is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
