    "intro": "Sinclairia pittieri, commonly known as the Pittieri's sinclairia, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often veined with a striking silver color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
