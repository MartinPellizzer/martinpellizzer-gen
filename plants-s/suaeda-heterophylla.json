    "intro": "Suaeda heterophylla, commonly known as coastal arrowgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding survival in arid coastal regions. The plant exhibits heterophylly, meaning it has different leaf forms depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Suaeda heterophylla plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
