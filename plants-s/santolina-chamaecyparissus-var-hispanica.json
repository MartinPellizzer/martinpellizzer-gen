    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish santolina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage that is densely packed and drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its slow growth and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
