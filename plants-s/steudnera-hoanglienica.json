    "intro": "Steudnera hoanglienica, commonly known as the Hoanglien arrowroot, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence composed of a spadix and a spathe. The plant features large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, making it a dramatic addition to any garden. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to produce edible tubers, though it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
