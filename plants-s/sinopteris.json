    "intro": "Sinopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or shaded environments, often growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates. Sinopteris species are characterized by their delicate, often pinnately divided fronds and their ability to thrive in moist, cool conditions. They play an important role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and contribute to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific microhabitats within their native ranges."
