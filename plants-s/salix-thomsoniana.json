    "intro": "Salix thomsoniana, commonly known as Thomson's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it blooms in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
