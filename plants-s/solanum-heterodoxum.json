    "intro": "Solanum heterodoxum, commonly known as the heterodox nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, oval-shaped leaves, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains numerous seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for human consumption but is studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
