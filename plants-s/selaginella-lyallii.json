    "intro": "Selaginella lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae) and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its ability to survive in low-light conditions makes it a common sight in temperate and subtropical regions. Selaginella lyallii is also noted for its resilience and has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation."
