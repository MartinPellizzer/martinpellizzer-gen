    "intro": "Sebastiania myrtilloides var. incana, commonly known as the silverleaf sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking leaf color and compact growth habit."
