    "intro": "Sphallerocarpus cyminum, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the wood is valued for its durability and strength."
