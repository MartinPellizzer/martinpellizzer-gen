    "intro": "Sedum nudum, commonly known as the naked sedum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial succulent that is drought-tolerant and easy to grow, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care."
