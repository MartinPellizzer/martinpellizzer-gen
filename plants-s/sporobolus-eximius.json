    "intro": "Sporobolus eximius, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 10 inches in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous spikelets, each containing a single floret. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Sporobolus eximius is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly soils, and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems."
