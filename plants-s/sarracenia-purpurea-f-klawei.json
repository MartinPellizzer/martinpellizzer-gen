This subspecies is characterized by its vibrant red to purple pitchers, which are modified leaves designed to trap and digest insects. The pitchers are often adorned with fine hairs and nectar-secreting glands that attract prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is a popular subject for both horticultural enthusiasts and scientific study."
