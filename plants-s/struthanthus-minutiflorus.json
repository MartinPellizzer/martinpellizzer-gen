    "intro": "Struthanthus minutiflorus, commonly known as the dwarf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that open in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Struthanthus minutiflorus is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
