    "intro": "Salix amygdalina var. meyeriana, commonly known as the Meier's white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its graceful appearance."
