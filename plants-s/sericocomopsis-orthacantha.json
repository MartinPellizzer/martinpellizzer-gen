    "intro": "Sericocomopsis orthacantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf sericocomopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, broad leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant's fibrous stems and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
