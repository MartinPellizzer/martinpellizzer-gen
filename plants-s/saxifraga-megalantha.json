    "intro": "Saxifraga megalantha, commonly known as the giant saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of large, fleshy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
