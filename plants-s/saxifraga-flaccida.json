    "intro": "Saxifraga flaccida, commonly known as the drooping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, usually arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Saxifraga flaccida is often found in mountainous areas and is an important component of alpine flora."
