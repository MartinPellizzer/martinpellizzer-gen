    "intro": "Santalodes hermannianum, commonly known as the Hermann's sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique aroma and ecological role, it is of interest in both botanical research and traditional medicine."
