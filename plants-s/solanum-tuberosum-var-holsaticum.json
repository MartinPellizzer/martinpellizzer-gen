    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. holsaticum, commonly known as the Holsatic potato, is a variety of the common potato plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its medium to large tubers with a smooth, pale yellow skin and a starchy, slightly waxy texture. This variety is well-suited for boiling and baking due to its firm flesh and mild flavor. It typically matures in about 90 to 100 days and is resistant to some common potato diseases. The plant produces violet flowers and has a bushy growth habit, typical of the Solanaceae family."
