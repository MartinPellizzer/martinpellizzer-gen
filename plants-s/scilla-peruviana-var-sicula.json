It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in spring. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its bulbs are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to naturalize over time. The species is closely related to other members of the Amaryllidaceae family, sharing similar structural and botanical characteristics."
