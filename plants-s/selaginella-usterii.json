    "intro": "Selaginella usterii, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often spirally arranged. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a characteristic feature of the lycophyte group. Selaginella usterii is known for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing tissues."
