    "intro": "Solanum neorickii, commonly known as the Neorick's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually purple or blue, with five petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, Solanum neorickii is considered a species of conservation concern."
