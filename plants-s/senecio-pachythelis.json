    "intro": "Senecio pachythelis, commonly known as the woolly Senecio, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant."
