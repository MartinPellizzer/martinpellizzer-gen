    "intro": "Solidago pilosa, commonly known as hairy goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along roadsides. Solidago pilosa plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the autumn season."
