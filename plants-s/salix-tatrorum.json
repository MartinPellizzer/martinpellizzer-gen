    "intro": "Salix tatrorum, commonly known as the Tatron willow, is a species of willow native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in cold, arid environments. The plant has slender, often zigzagging branches and produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered with a fine layer of silvery hair. Salix tatrorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
