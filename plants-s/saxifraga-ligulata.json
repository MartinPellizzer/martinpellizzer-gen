    "intro": "Saxifraga ligulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features upright stems with opposite, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga ligulata is known for its hardiness and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
