    "intro": "Syngonanthus planus, commonly known as the flatleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has a mat-forming habit with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with succulent leaves that store water. Syngonanthus planus is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
