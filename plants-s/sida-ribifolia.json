It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in wetlands. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Sida ribifolia is often found in wetland habitats and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
