    "intro": "Solanum balbisii var. bipinnata, commonly known as the bipinnate nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its compound leaves with a bipinnate structure, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
