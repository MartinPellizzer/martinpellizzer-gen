    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 sedenii var. albanense, commonly known as the Albanian selenipedium, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Albania. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy, yellow-green flowers that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its slow growth and long flowering period. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
