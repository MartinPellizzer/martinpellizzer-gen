    "intro": "Saussurea durgae, commonly known as the Himalayan saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is adapted to cold and arid conditions, with fibrous roots that help it survive in rocky, mountainous terrain. Its flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Saussurea durgae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
