    "intro": "Serapias lingua f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf tongue orchid, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that resemble a tongue. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This ornamental plant is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
