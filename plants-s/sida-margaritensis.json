    "intro": "Sida margaritensis, commonly known as sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Sida margaritensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
