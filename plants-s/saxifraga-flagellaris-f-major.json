    "intro": "Saxifraga flagellaris f. major, commonly known as the giant saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and large, waxy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
