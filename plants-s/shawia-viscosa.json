    "intro": "Shawia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that secrete a sticky substance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its unique leaf texture and ability to retain moisture make it well adapted to arid environments. Shawia viscosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
