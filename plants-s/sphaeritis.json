    "intro": "Sphaeritis, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Porellaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, compact growth form and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Sphaeritis species typically have a thallus that is globular or cushion-like, with distinct leaf-like structures called phyllidia. They reproduce through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called soridia. Due to their unique morphology and ecological preferences, Sphaeritis species are important indicators of humid, undisturbed habitats."
