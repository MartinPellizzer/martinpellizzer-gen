    "intro": "Samanea leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved acacia, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are slender and delicate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in racemose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Samanea leptophylla is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
