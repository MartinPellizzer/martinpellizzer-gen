    "intro": "Salix heterandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, meadows, and forest edges. Salix heterandra is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
