    "intro": "Saxifraga castellana f. pauciflora, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
