    "intro": "Sarcopodium geminatum, commonly known as the twin-leaf swamp fern, is a species native to wetland environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that emerge from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in marshy or boggy habitats, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. Sarcopodium geminatum plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
