    "intro": "Stelis pudens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features delicate, pale green leaves and produces striking, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Stelis pudens is highly sought after in botanical conservation efforts."
