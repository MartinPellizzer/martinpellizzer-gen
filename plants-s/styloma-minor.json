    "intro": "Styloma minor, commonly known as the lesser styloma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its delicate, clustered leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include slender stems, opposite leaf arrangement, and a short flowering period. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
