    "intro": "Spiranthes sceptrodes, commonly known as the pink spire orchid, is a native North American orchid species characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flower clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle yet striking floral display. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. Botanically, it is notable for its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its rhizomes for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption."
