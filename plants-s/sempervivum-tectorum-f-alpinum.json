It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
