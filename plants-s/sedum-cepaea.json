    "intro": "Sedum cepaea, commonly known as the \"buttercup sedum,\" is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette-like growth pattern, with leaves that are typically green and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Sedum cepaea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
