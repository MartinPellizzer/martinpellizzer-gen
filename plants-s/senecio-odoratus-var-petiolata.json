It is characterized by its striking purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slight waxy coating, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The variety petiolata is distinguished by its elongated leaf petioles, which give it a unique appearance compared to other Senecio species."
