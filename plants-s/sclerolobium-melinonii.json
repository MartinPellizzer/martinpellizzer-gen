It is characterized by its rigid, spiny branches and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a useful plant for erosion control."
