    "intro": "Schefflera abyssinica, commonly known as the African arrowleaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to East Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a palmate pattern with elongated, arrow-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated as a houseplant in warmer climates."
