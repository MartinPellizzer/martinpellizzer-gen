    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum f. pallidum, commonly known as the paleleaf nightshade, is a variant of the Solanum stenotomum species, which belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its pale green to white leaves, which distinguish it from the typical green foliage of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic alkaloids. It is native to parts of Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
