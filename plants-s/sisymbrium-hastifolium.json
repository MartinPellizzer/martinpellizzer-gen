    "intro": "Sisymbrium hastifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems and pinnately divided, narrow leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruits are pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural settings."
