    "intro": "Selaginella regularis, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Selaginella regularis reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
