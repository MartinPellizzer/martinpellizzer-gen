    "intro": "Scirpus praelongatus, commonly known as the long-stalked bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically arranged in panicles at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus praelongatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife."
