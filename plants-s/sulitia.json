    "intro": "Sulitia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, Sulitia is well adapted to dry environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
