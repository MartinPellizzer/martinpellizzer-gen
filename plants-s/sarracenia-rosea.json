    "intro": "Sarracenia rosea, commonly known as the pink pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pitcher-shaped leaves that are typically pink or red in color. These leaves secrete a sticky fluid that traps insects, which are then digested by enzymes to provide nutrients. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires a humid, sunny environment. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
