    "intro": "Swida purpusii, commonly known as the Chinese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the autumn. Swida purpusii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to temperate climates."
