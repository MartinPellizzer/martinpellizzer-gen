    "intro": "Silene puranensis, commonly known as the Puran Mountain Catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of India. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene puranensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
