It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive sericocarp fruits, which are covered in a silky, hair-like coating. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its deep root system. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies due to its limited distribution and specialized morphology."
