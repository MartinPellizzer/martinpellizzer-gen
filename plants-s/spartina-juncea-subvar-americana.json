    "intro": "Spartina juncea subvar. americana, commonly known as American cordgrass, is a salt-tolerant perennial grass found in coastal wetlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and filtering water in estuarine environments. It thrives in brackish and saline soils, often forming dense stands in tidal marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish extensive root systems that help prevent erosion."
