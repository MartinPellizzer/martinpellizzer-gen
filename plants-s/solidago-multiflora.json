    "intro": "Solidago multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to dry soils in woodland or open areas. Solidago multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
