    "intro": "Senecio makineanus, commonly known as the Makinean groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the island of Makin in the Tuamotu Archipelago. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
