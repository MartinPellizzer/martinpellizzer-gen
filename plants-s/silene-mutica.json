It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Silene mutica is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is also known for its sticky secretions, which can trap small insects."
