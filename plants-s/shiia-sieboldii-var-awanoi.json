    "intro": "Shiia sieboldii var. awanoi, commonly known as the Awano shiia, is a rare variant of the shiia plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
