    "intro": "Stipa pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny florets. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppes, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Stipa pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
