    "intro": "Strychnos dundusanensis, commonly known as the African strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, woody capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are a key feature in its botanical classification. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in semi-arid to tropical climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
