    "intro": "Senecio saruwagedensis, commonly known as the Saruwagede groundsels, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, white or greyish hairs, while its yellow flowers are arranged in dense, daisy-like clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
