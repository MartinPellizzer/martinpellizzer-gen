    "intro": "Schoenus niveus, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the fine, silky hairs covering its leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Schoenus niveus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
