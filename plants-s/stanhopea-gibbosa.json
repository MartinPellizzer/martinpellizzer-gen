It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a waxy, lip that is often brightly colored. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stanhopea gibbosa is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
