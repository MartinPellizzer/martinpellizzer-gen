    "intro": "Selaginella hypopterygia, commonly known as the clubmoss or ground pine, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella hypopterygia is notable for its ability to survive extreme conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing tissues."
