    "intro": "Strychnos angolensis, commonly known as the African angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, woody capsules containing toxic seeds, which contain the alkaloids strychnine and brucine. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal. However, due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
