    "intro": "Solanum laciniatum f. tasmanicum, commonly known as the Tasmanian nightshade, is a variant of the common nightshade plant. It is a herbaceous perennial native to Tasmania, characterized by its hairy stems and lobed, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its berries are edible when ripe but contain solanine, a toxic alkaloid. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
