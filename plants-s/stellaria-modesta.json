    "intro": "Stellaria modesta, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white flowers with five petals that resemble stars, giving it its scientific name. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along pathways. Stellaria modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
