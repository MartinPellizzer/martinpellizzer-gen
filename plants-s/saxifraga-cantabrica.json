    "intro": "Saxifraga cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, and its leaves are usually basal, with a rosette-like arrangement. It is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
