    "intro": "Stapelia conformis var. abrasa, commonly known as the Desert Ghost, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are typically small and pointed, reducing water loss through transpiration. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
