    "intro": "Sporobolus distichivaginatus, commonly known as the two-rowed false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid regions."
