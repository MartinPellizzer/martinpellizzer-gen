    "intro": "Stenoptera koehleri, commonly known as the velvetleaf stenoptera, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
