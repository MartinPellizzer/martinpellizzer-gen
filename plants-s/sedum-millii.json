    "intro": "Sedum millii, commonly known as the desert sedum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent species, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that help it survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Sedum millii is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to prevent soil erosion in rocky or sandy habitats."
