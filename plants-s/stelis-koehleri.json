It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America. Stelis koehleri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil for optimal growth."
