    "intro": "Sphenomeris minutula, commonly known as the small flat mite, is a species of mite belonging to the family Sphenomeridae. It is a minute arachnid, typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length, and is characterized by its flattened body and elongated legs. This species is often found in moist environments, such as leaf litter or soil, where it plays a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling. Its botanical significance lies in its interaction with plant debris, contributing to the breakdown of organic matter. Due to its small size and cryptic behavior, Sphenomeris minutula is rarely studied in botanical contexts."
