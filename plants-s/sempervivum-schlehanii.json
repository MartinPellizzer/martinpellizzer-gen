    "intro": "Sempervivum schlehanii, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Sempervivum schlehanii is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its ornamental value and resilience."
