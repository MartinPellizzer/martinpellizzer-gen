It is a tall, slender palm characterized by its long, pinnate leaves and clustered inflorescences. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible, spiny fruits.
