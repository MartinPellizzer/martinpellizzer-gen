    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos carrii, commonly known as the Carri's globe flower, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its spherical, brightly colored flower heads that resemble small globes, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower structure. Sphaerostephanos carrii typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
