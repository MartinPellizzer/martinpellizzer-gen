    "intro": "Selaginella desvauxii, commonly known as the desert spikemoss, is a vascular fern that thrives in arid environments. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and a low-growing, mat-forming habit. This plant is native to regions such as southern Africa and parts of the Middle East, where it adapts to extreme drought conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are typically found on the stems. Selaginella desvauxii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying drought tolerance in plants."
