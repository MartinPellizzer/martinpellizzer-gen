    "intro": "Serianthes vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis Ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the islands of Vanuatu and Fiji. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various species. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species."
