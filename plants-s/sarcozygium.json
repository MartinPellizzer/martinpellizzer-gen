    "intro": "Sarcozygium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its perennial herbaceous growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features rhizomatous stems and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Sarcozygium species are native to regions of eastern North America and are often found in woodland areas. Due to their toxic properties, these plants are generally avoided by herbivores and are considered to have limited horticultural value."
