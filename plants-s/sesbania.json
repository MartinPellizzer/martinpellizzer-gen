    "intro": "Sesbania, commonly known as the velvet bean or cuphea, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Sesbania species are characterized by their compound leaves, often with a velvety texture, and their showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. They are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making them valuable in soil enrichment and agricultural systems. Many species are also cultivated for their edible seeds and ornamental value."
