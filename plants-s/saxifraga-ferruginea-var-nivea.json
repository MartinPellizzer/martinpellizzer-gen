    "intro": "Saxifraga ferruginea var. nivea, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features rosettes of silver-white, hairy leaves that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to extreme climates and a popular choice for rock gardens."
