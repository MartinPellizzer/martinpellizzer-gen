    "intro": "Saussurea atrata, commonly known as the black safflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy composite flower heads that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, achene-like seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. Saussurea atrata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
