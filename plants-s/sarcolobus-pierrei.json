    "intro": "Sarcolobus pierrei, commonly known as the Sierra Madre alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle purple hue. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Sarcolobus pierrei is a rare and specialized species, often found in isolated populations due to its specific habitat requirements."
