    "intro": "Schistostephium oxylobum, commonly known as the mountain rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Schistostephium oxylobum is often found growing on rocky slopes and in dry, sunny habitats."
