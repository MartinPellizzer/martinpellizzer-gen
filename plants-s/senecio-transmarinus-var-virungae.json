The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. This variant is notable for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
