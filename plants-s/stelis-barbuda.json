    "intro": "Stelis barbuda, commonly known as the Barbuda stelis, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and partial shade, often growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them. Stelis barbuda is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
