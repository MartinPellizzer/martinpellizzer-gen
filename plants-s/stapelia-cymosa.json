    "intro": "Stapelia cymosa, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators like moths. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Stapelia cymosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
