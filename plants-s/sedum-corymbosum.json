    "intro": "Sedum corymbosum, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to North America. It features fleshy, upright leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Sedum corymbosum is also valued for its low maintenance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
