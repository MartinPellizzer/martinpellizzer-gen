    "intro": "Silphium confertifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved silphium, is a rare and ancient plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy foliage. The plant features large, broad leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces yellowish or reddish composite flowers. Silphium confertifolium is known for its medicinal properties, historically used by indigenous peoples for its purported healing abilities. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered critically endangered."
