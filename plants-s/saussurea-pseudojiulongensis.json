    "intro": "Saussurea pseudojiulongensis, commonly known as the Yunnan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of western China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy composite flower heads. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, producing a mix of white and yellow petals that attract pollinators. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
