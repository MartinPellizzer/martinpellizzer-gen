    "intro": "Setaria italica var. pachystachys, commonly known as finger millet, is a grass species native to Africa and cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, finger-like spikes of small, hard seeds that are harvested for food. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a resilient crop in arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are sturdy and branched. The seeds are rich in nutrients, including calcium and iron, and are used in a variety of traditional dishes."
