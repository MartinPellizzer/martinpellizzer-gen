    "intro": "Scaevola kilaueae, commonly known as the Kilauea ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. It has hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, seed-filled capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
