    "intro": "Spiranthes smallii, commonly known as the small's ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and wetlands. It produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in areas with well-drained, loamy soil and partial to full shade."
