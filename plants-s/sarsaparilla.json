    "intro": "Sarsaparilla, commonly known as *Smilax* species, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its climbing or shrub-like growth habit, with waxy, often spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by bright red berries. Sarsaparilla is native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its roots and stems have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
