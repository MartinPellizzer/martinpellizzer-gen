    "intro": "Schomburgkia lueddemannii, commonly known as the Schomburgkia orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or purple markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water and nutrients, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. The orchid thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
