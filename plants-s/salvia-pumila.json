    "intro": "Salvia pumila, commonly known as the rock sage or mountain sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and grayish-green foliage, which helps it thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Salvia pumila is a member of the Lamiaceae family, known for its aromatic properties and medicinal uses. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
