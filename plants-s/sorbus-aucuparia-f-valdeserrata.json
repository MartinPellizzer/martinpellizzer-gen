    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. valdeserrata, commonly known as the white-thorned rowan, is a variant of the common rowan tree. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale yellow berries, which contrast with its dark, thorny branches. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical rowan, with a dense canopy of small leaves. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
