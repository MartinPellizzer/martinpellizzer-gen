    "intro": "Saxifraga moorcroftiana, commonly known as the Moorcroft's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga moorcroftiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
