    "intro": "Spiraea ciliata, commonly known as the silky willow or smooth spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a soft, velvety texture and finely toothed margins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
