It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with a faintly hairy texture, and the plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Stauranthus perforatus is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
