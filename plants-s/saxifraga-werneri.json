    "intro": "Saxifraga werneri, commonly known as the Werneri's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, often succulent leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga werneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
