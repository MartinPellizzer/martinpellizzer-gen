    "intro": "Selaginella proniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Selaginella proniflora is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures."
