    "intro": "Stipa grafiana, commonly known as the Grafian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Stipa grafiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
