    "intro": "Spiranthes rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiral arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are rounded at the tips, giving it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Spiranthes rotundifolia is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
