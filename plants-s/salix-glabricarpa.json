It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are elliptic to lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a silvery underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated fruits. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian areas."
