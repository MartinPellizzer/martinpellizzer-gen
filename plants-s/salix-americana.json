    "intro": "Salix americana, commonly known as the American willow, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and bright green during the growing season. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is thin and peels in papery strips, and it often grows along streambanks and wetlands. Salix americana is valued for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
