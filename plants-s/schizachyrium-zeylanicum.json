    "intro": "Schizachyrium zeylanicum, commonly known as purple lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that produce panicles of purple to pinkish flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its striking floral display and drought tolerance."
