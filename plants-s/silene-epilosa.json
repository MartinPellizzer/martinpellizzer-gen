It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene epilosa is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight."
