    "intro": "Solanum huaylasense, commonly known as the Huaylas nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of Peru. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may be utilized in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
