It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond edges. Its ability to tolerate both submerged and emergent conditions makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
