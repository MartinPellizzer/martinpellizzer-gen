    "intro": "Seriola scapigera, commonly known as the silver pomfret, is a marine fish belonging to the family Serranidae. It is characterized by its streamlined body, silver-scaled skin, and a distinctive scapular process on the dorsal fin. This species is found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. The plant-like appearance of its fins and body has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant. Seriola scapigera plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both a predator and prey species."
