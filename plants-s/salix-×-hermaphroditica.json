    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 hermaphroditica, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Salix alba and Salix cinerea. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, temperate regions. The plant features slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces catkins, which are the primary means of pollination in willow species. Salix \u00d7 hermaphroditica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
