It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with feathery, silver-green leaves. The plant produces dense, cylindrical seed heads that are often used in ornamental landscaping due to their elegant appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of native plant communities and its use in ecological restoration projects."
