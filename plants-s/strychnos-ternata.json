    "intro": "Strychnos ternata, commonly known as the Indian strychnos, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its roots and leaves contain toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a pesticide. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture and requires careful handling."
