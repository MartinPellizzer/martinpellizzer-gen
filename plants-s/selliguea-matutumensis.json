    "intro": "Selliguea matutumensis, commonly known as the morning glory fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth and small, overlapping leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, contain spores that are dispersed by wind. Selliguea matutumensis is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense."
