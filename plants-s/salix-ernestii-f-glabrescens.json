    "intro": "Salix ernestii f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a rare and unique variant of the Ernest willow. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous foliage, which distinguishes it from other willow species. This shrub or small tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. It has slender, flexible branches and produces catkins in early spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
