    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 millstreamiana, commonly known as the Millstream saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer months. Its leaves are usually succulent, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is well adapted to coastal and inland environments, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
