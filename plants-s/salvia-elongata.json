    "intro": "Salvia elongata, commonly known as the slender sage, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
