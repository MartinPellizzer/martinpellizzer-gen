    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 polesica, commonly known as the Polish willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix viminalis and Salix triandra. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. Salix \u00d7 polesica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of wet and marginal soils."
