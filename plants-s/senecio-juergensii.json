It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in drought conditions. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
