    "intro": "Stipa okmirii, commonly known as the Okmiri needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering spikes are usually small and clustered, producing delicate, feathery bristles that release lightweight seeds. Stipa okmirii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
