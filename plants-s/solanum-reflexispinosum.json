    "intro": "Solanum reflexispinosum, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features woody stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often blooming in spring. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, making them dangerous if ingested. Despite its harmful properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution."
