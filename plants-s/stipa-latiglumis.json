    "intro": "Stipa latiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and poor soil conditions. Stipa latiglumis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
