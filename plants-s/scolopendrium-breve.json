    "intro": "Scolopendrium breve, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, mossy appearance. Scolopendrium breve thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the base of the plant and produce spores for propagation."
