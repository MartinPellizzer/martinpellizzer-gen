    "intro": "Stelis intonsa, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them. Stelis intonsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
