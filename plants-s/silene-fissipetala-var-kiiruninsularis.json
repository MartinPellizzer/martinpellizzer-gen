    "intro": "Silene fissipetala var. kiiruninsularis, commonly known as the Kiiru Island catchfly, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Kiiru in the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, and it is pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
