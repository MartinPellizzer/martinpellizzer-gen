    "intro": "Semenovia lasiocarpa subsp. incana, commonly known as the rough-haired snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The subspecies incana is distinguished by its more pronounced hairiness compared to other subspecies of Semenovia lasiocarpa."
