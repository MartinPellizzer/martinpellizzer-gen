    "intro": "Stellaria kotschyana, commonly known as the Armenian starwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers and a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Stellaria kotschyana is adapted to harsh alpine environments, exhibiting resilience to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. It is often found in high-altitude meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
