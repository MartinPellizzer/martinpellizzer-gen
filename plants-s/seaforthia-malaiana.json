    "intro": "Seaforthia malaiana, commonly known as the Malaian seaforthia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the shoreline or in dune environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it highly adaptable to arid and saline conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
