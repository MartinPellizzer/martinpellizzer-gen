    "intro": "Selaginella marahuacae, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which produce spores for propagation. Selaginella marahuacae is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in tropical and subtropical regions."
