    "intro": "Sclerocactus spinosior subsp. nyensis, commonly known as the New Mexico spineless cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems that are typically spineless or nearly spineless. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
