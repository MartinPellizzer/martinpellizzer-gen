    "intro": "Schefflera arborea, commonly known as the evergreen holly tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern around the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera arborea is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its adaptability to various soil types."
