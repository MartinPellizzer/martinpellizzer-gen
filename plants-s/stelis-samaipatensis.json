    "intro": "Stelis samaipatensis, commonly known as the Samaipata orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to tree trunks without deriving nutrients from them. Stelis samaipatensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
