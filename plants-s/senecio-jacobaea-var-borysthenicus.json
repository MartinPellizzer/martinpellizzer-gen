    "intro": "Senecio jacobaea var. borysthenicus, commonly known as the Borysthenic ragwort, is a variant of the common ragwort, characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy foliage. It is native to parts of Eastern Europe and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and can grow up to 1 meter in height. It produces numerous small, bright yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. This variant is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
