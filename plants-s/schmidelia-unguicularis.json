    "intro": "Schmidelia unguicularis, commonly known as the stickyweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its unique feature is the secretion of a sticky substance from its leaves, which helps in deterring herbivores. Schmidelia unguicularis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and water-storing tissues."
