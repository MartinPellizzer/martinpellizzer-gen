    "intro": "Salix dependens, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green color that turns yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive near water sources."
