    "intro": "Senecio lactucifolius, commonly known as the lettuce-leaved groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are lobed and resemble those of lettuce, hence its common name. It produces yellow flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits known as cypselae."
