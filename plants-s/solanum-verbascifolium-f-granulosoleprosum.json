    "intro": "Solanum verbascifolium f. granulosoleprosum, commonly known as the granular-leaved nightshade, is a variant of the verbascifolium species within the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, woolly, granular texture on the leaves, which gives it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its drought-resistant features. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of violet or blue, and it produces berries that may contain toxic compounds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variations and ecological adaptations."
