    "intro": "Sebastiania edwalliana var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet-sebastiania, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences, which are typical of the genus Sebastiania. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
