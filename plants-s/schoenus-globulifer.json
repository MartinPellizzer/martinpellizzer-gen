    "intro": "Schoenus globulifer, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a globular shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue. Schoenus globulifer plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
