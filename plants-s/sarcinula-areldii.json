    "intro": "Sarcinula areldii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to parts of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves and produces capsules as its fruit, which contain numerous small seeds. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. Sarcinula areldii is also noted for its nocturnal blooming habit, which attracts specific pollinators such as moths."
