    "intro": "Silene rosulata var. crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed campion, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, reddish stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
