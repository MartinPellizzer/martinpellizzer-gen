    "intro": "Siraitia borneensis var. lobophylla, commonly known as the Bornean giant cupua\u00e7u, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits with a sweet, tropical flavor. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential economic value as a fruit crop. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
