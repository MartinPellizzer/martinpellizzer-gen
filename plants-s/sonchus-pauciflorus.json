    "intro": "Sonchus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and the presence of milky sap when the leaves are broken."
