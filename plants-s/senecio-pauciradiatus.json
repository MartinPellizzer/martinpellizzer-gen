It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
