    "intro": "Salix viminalis var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf willow, is a variant of the common osier dogwood. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and flexible, woody stems that are often used in basket making. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. The flowers are catkins, and the plant plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
