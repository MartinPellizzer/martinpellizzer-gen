    "intro": "Sullivantia hapemanii var. hapemanii, commonly known as the Hapeman's sullivantia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Texas. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance, while its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
