    "intro": "Sedum insulare, commonly known as the island sedum, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a low-growing, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Sedum insulare is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
