    "intro": "Stipa arabica subsp. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife."
