    "intro": "Secamone bifida, commonly known as the split-leaved secamone, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bifid (split) leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule and dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats."
