It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
