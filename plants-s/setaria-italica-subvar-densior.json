It is characterized by its dense, bristly inflorescences that resemble a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is an annual crop with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, hard grains that are used for food and animal feed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a valuable crop in arid environments. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a high seed yield per unit area."
