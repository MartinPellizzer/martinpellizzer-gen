    "intro": "Solanum antipovichi var. neoantipoviczii, commonly known as the Antipovich solanum, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, egg-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, smooth-skinned berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
