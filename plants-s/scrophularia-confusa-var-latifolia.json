It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are broad at the base, giving it its common name. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink or purple. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
