    "intro": "Stipagrostis libyca subsp. libyca, commonly known as the Libyan arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of the vegetation in its native habitat."
