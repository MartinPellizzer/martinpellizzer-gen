    "intro": "Scleria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Scleria humilis is an important species in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
