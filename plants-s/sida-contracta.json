    "intro": "Sida contracta, commonly known as smallleaf cotton or narrowleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss. Sida contracta is also known for its small, round, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by wind."
