    "intro": "Statice armeria var. elongata, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences of blue to pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of salt, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Statice armeria var. elongata is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in coastal gardens."
