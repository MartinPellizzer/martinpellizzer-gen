    "intro": "Shorea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved shorea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
