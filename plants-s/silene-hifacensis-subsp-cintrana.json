    "intro": "Silene hifacensis subsp. cintrana, commonly known as the Hifafu cintrana, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and upright. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
