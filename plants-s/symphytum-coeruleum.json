It is characterized by its attractive, bluish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has rosettes of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
