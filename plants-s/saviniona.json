    "intro": "Saviniona, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, showy bracts that resemble petals, often mistaken for actual flowers. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. Saviniona species typically have palmate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous true flowers. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental bracts and are often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
