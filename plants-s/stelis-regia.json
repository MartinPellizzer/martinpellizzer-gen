    "intro": "Stelis regia, commonly known as the royal stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis regia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
