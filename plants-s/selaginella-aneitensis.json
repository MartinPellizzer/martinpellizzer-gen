    "intro": "Selaginella aneitensis, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are released for propagation. Selaginella aneitensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
