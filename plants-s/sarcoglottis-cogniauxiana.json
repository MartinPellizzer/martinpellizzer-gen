    "intro": "Sarcoglottis cogniauxiana, commonly known as the Congo arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive spatulate leaves and inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, often with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe."
