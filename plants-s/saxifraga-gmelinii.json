    "intro": "Saxifraga gmelinii, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Saxifraga gmelinii is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
