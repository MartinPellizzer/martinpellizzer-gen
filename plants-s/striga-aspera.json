    "intro": "Striga aspera, commonly known as the rough striga, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of leaves and reliance on parasitic relationships with host plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops like maize and sorghum."
