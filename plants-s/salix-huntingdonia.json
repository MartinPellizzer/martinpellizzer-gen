    "intro": "Salix huntingdonia, commonly known as the Huntington willow, is a rare and endangered species native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, riparian habitats. The plant has slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, which are typical of willow species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Salix huntingdonia is highly vulnerable to environmental changes."
