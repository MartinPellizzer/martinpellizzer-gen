    "intro": "Sida leschenaultiana, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sida leschenaultiana is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
