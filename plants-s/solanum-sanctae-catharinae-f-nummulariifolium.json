    "intro": "Solanum sanctae-catharinae f. nummulariifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a rare and unique variant of the Solanum genus. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray leaves, which are small, rounded, and densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that mature to a deep blue-black color. Native to the island of Socotra, it thrives in arid and rocky environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
