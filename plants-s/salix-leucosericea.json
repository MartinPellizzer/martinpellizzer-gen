    "intro": "Salix leucosericea, commonly known as the white-tomentose willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-white, hairy bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Salix leucosericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
