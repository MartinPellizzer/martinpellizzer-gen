    "intro": "Scleranthus aschersonii, commonly known as the coastal thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed and sandy habitats. Scleranthus aschersonii is adapted to withstand salt spray and drought conditions."
