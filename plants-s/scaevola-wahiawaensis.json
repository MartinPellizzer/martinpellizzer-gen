    "intro": "Scaevola wahiawaensis, commonly known as the Wahiawa scabious, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bilaterally symmetrical blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
