    "intro": "Sagittaria simplex, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, narrow leaves submerged in the water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters above the water. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Sagittaria simplex is an important plant for aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
