It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, helping it conserve water. The flowers open in a specific orientation, with the lip facing downward, which is a distinctive feature of this species."
