    "intro": "Sphenomeris chinensis var. rheophila, commonly known as the stream fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in fast-flowing, nutrient-rich streams and rivers, where it attaches itself to rocks or submerged vegetation. The plant has long, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on water currents for spore dispersal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
