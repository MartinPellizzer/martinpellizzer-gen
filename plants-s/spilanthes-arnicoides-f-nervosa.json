It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves with distinct venation, which is a key feature of the 'nervosa' form. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
