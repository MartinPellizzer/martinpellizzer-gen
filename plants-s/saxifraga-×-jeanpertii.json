    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 jeanpertii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
