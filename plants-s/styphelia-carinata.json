    "intro": "Styphelia carinata, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in shaded environments make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes. Styphelia carinata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
