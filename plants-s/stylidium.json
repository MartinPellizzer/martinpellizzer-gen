    "intro": "Stylidium, commonly known as the sticky seed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Commelinaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique seed structure, where the seeds are attached to a fleshy, sticky stalk that aids in seed dispersal. Stylidium species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They produce small, showy flowers that are often brightly colored to attract pollinators. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are native to Australia and South America."
