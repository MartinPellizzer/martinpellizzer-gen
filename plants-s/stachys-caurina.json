    "intro": "Stachys caurina, commonly known as woolly betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive grayish-blue hue due to dense pubescence. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Stachys caurina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties."
