    "intro": "Semiaquilegia ecalcarata f. semicalcarata, commonly known as the slender water bellflower, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant features slender, creeping stems and lanceolate leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
