    "intro": "Salsola trigyna, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in deserts, coastal dunes, and disturbed areas. Salsola trigyna plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
