    "intro": "Saxifraga muricola var. brachypetala, commonly known as the short-petioled saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white. The leaves are typically rounded with a waxy coating, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. This variety is distinguished by its shorter petioles compared to the typical form of Saxifraga muricola. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
