It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its spherical, seed-bearing heads that resemble small globes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sisyrinchium orbiculatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
