    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium var. stoloniferum, commonly known as eastern gamma grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a valuable native plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
