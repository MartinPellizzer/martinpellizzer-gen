    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos telefominicus, commonly known as the Telefomin skyflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its spherical, multi-layered inflorescence that resembles a flower cluster suspended in the air. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
