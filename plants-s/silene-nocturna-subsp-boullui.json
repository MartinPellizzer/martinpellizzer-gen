    "intro": "Silene nocturna subsp. boullui, commonly known as the evening silene, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its pink to purple flowers that open in the evening, adapting to nocturnal pollination by moths. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It has slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
