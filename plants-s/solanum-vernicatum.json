    "intro": "Solanum vernicatum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It is known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids such as solasodine, which can be harmful if ingested. Solanum vernicatum is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
