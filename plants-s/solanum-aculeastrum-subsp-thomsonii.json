    "intro": "Solanum aculeastrum subsp. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's prickly nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its spiny stems and dark green, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berries that transition from green to red as they mature. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
