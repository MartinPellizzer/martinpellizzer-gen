    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea var. acetaria, commonly known as sea bean or glasswort, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a succulent plant with jointed, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in coastal areas. The plant produces small, green to red flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures. It is widely distributed along shorelines and salt marshes, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various organisms. This species is also used in culinary applications and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
