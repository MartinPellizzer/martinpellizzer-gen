    "intro": "Stevia glomerata, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant is renowned for its intensely sweet-tasting leaves, which contain steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used as sugar substitutes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial cultivation. Stevia glomerata is also valued for its medicinal properties, including potential benefits for blood sugar regulation."
