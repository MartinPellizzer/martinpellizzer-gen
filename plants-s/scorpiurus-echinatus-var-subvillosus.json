    "intro": "Scorpiurus echinatus var. subvillosus, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of North America. It features a succulent, branched stem covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and also bear a similar hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
