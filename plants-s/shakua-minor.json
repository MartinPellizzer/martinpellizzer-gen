    "intro": "Shakua minor, commonly known as the lesser shakua, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central and southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery fuzz. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the rainy season, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Shakua minor is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its succulent stems and leaves. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deep within the soil."
