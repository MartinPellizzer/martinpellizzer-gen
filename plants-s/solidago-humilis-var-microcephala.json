    "intro": "Solidago humilis var. microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf goldenrod, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils in full sun to partial shade, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Its compact size and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
