    "intro": "Sanguisorba media, commonly known as common burningnettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, reddish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Sanguisorba media is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
