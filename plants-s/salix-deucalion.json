    "intro": "Salix deucalion, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically white- or gray-haired underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are either male or female, and it is known for its ability to thrive in wet or moist environments. Salix deucalion is often found along streambanks and in damp woodlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its bark and leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties."
