    "intro": "Saussurea stracheyana, commonly known as the Kashmir saffron, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India, Nepal, and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally recognized in Ayurvedic and Tibetan medicine. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
