    "intro": "Salacia rugulosa, commonly known as the rough salacia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its rugged, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Its leaves are typically ovate with a rough texture, contributing to its common name. Salacia rugulosa is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
