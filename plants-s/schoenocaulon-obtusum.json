It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
