    "intro": "Stachys sidamoensis f. neumannii, commonly known as the Neumann's hedge nettle, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale purple flowers in whorled clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
