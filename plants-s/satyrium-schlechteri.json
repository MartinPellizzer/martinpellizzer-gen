    "intro": "Satyrium schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, producing a violet-blue flower with a yellowish lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
