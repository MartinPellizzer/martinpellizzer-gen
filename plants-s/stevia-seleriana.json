    "intro": "Stevia seleriana, commonly known as sweetleaf or sugarleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are harvested and used as a natural sweetener, making it a popular alternative to sugar in many cultures. Stevia seleriana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
