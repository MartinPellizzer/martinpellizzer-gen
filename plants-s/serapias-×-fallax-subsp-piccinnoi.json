    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 fallax subsp. piccinnoi, commonly known as the Piccinno's hybrid marsh orchid, is a hybrid species native to the wetlands and marshy areas of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy, orchid-like flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing in dense rosettes near the base of the plant. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in moist, well-drained garden soils."
