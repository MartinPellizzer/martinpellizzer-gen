    "intro": "Salix parishiana, commonly known as the Parry willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Salix parishiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
