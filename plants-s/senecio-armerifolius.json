    "intro": "Senecio armerifolius, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with low rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
