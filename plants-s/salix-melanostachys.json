    "intro": "Salix melanostachys, commonly known as black-stamen willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black stamens, which give it its common name, and its slender, often zigzagging branches. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Salix melanostachys plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
