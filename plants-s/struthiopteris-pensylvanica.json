    "intro": "Struthiopteris pensylvanica, commonly known as the eastern wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, underground stem that produces both roots and new shoots. Its leaves, or fronds, are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. Struthiopteris pensylvanica thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
