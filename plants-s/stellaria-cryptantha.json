    "intro": "Stellaria cryptantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, star-shaped white flowers and slender, hairy stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention in cold, harsh environments. Stellaria cryptantha is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, where it thrives in full sun. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand extreme weather conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
