    "intro": "Spilanthes radicans, commonly known as the creeping bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in dry, sandy soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by pods that split open to release its seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Spilanthes radicans is also noted for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
