    "intro": "Saxifraga gormanii, commonly known as the Gorman's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Saxifraga gormanii is a hardy species that is often found in areas with high elevations and cool climates."
