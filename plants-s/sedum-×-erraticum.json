    "intro": "Sedum \u00d7 erraticum, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Sedum \u00d7 erraticum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
