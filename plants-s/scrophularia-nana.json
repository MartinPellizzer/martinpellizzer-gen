    "intro": "Scrophularia nana, commonly known as dwarf scrophularia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Scrophularia nana is often found in disturbed soils and can be a valuable component of native plant communities."
