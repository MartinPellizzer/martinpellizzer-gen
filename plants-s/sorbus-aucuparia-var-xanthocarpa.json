It is characterized by its bright yellow berries, which contrast strikingly with its dark green foliage. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often growing in woodland areas. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, with a distinctive red or orange hue in autumn. The yellowrowan is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant seasonal color."
