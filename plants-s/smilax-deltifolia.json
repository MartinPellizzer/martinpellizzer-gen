    "intro": "Smilax deltifolia, commonly known as the dwarf greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate or pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Smilax deltifolia is known for its ability to spread through both rhizomes and seeds, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
