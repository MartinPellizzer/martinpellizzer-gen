    "intro": "Smilax lanceolata, commonly known as the arrowleaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and arrow-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Smilax lanceolata thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
