It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments.
