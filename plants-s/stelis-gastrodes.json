    "intro": "Stelis gastrodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
