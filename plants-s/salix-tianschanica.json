    "intro": "Salix tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
