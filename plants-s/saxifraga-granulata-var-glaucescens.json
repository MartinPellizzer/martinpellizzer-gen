    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating that gives them a bluish-gray appearance. This variety thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
