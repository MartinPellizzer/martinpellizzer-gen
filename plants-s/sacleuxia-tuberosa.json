    "intro": "Sacleuxia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous scaleflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, scale-like leaves and bears yellow or orange flowers during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Sacleuxia tuberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
