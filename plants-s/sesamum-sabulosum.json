It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, brittle shell, and the plant is often found growing in sandy or coastal soils. Sesamum sabulosum is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
