    "intro": "Selaginella breuensis, commonly known as the Brazilian clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella breuensis is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures called strobila. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and adaptation."
