    "intro": "Senegalia rostrata, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often reduced to spines, and its yellow, globular inflorescences that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain seeds with a hard coat, adapted for dispersal by animals or through wind. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems. Senegalia rostrata is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock."
