    "intro": "Senecio strictifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaved groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are narrow, rigid, and often have a blue-green hue due to the presence of trichomes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
