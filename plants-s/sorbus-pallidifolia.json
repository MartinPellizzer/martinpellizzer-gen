It is characterized by its white or pale yellow flowers that appear in late spring, followed by small, orange-red berries in the fall. The leaves are typically oval or elliptical, with a waxy surface and a pale green to silvery underside. This plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food for various birds and small mammals."
