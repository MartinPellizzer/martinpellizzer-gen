    "intro": "Stauropsis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or arid environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. They are characterized by their small, often delicate flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. Stauropsis species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil. Their unique botanical features make them an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
