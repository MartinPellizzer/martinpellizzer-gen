    "intro": "Solanum mollissimum, commonly known as the velvet nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a deep purple, containing toxic compounds such as solanine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
