    "intro": "Solanum nematorhachis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, characterized by its narrow, woody stems and opposite leaves. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive blue or purple hue, and it produces berries that contain toxic compounds. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical studies."
