    "intro": "Sandoricum ternatum, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Sandoricum ternatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
