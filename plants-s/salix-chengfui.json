    "intro": "Salix chengfui, commonly known as the Chengfui willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. Salix chengfui is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
