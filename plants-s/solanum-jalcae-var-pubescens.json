It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that mature to a yellow or orange color. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and research settings."
