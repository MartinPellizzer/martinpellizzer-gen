    "intro": "Solidago alpicola, commonly known as the alpine goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Solidago alpicola is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in extreme alpine conditions."
