    "intro": "Santolina rosmarinifolia subsp. ceratophylla, commonly known as silver santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters in the spring, which are followed by small, dry, papery fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit make it both ornamental and useful in herbal applications."
