    "intro": "Stelis villosilabia, commonly known as the hairy-labellum orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and its distinctive, hairy labellum, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Stelis villosilabia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
