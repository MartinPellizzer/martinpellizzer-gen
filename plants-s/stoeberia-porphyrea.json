    "intro": "Stoeberia porphyrea, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Stoeberia porphyrea is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of high-elevation plant communities."
