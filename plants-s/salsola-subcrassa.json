    "intro": "Salsola subcrassa, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is a perennial shrub or subshrub characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a common component of desert and coastal ecosystems. Salsola subcrassa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
