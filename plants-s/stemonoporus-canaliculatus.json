    "intro": "Stemonoporus canaliculatus, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often adorned with small, shallow channels along the midrib. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
