    "intro": "Statice sinuata var. subglabra, commonly known as the soft pink statice, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to soft pink. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight waxy coating. This variety is less hairy than the typical statice, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens and floral arrangements."
