    "intro": "Sorghum smithianum, commonly known as the desert sorghum, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family. It has deep roots that allow it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Due to its resilience, Sorghum smithianum is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
