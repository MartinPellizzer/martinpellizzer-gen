    "intro": "Solanum rigescens var. didymanthum, commonly known as the purple passion vine, is a vigorous climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of violet to purple tubular flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing toxic seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
