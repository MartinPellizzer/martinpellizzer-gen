    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. integrifolium, commonly known as bittersweet nightshade, is a perennial vine native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically entire or slightly notched, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, orange, or yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its berries are a food source for birds, which help in seed dispersal."
