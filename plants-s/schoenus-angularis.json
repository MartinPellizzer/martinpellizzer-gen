    "intro": "Schoenus angularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as fens and peat bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Schoenus angularis plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
