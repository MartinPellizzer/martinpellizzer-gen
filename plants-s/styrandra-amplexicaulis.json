    "intro": "Styrandra amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping-stem styrax, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique feature is the way its leaves wrap around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually pink or white and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
