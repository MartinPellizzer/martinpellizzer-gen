It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in damp soil near water sources. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with finely ciliated margins, giving it its scientific name. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and produce small, three-lobed flowers. Scleria ciliata var. ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist conditions."
