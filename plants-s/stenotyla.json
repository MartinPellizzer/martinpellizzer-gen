It is characterized by its unique, small, and often inconspicuous flowers, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plants are native to various regions in Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. They often grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their succulent leaves and specialized root systems. Stenotyla species are primarily valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in their native habitats."
