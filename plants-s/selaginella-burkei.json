    "intro": "Selaginella burkei, commonly known as the Burke's spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a perennial evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of spirally arranged, scale-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Selaginella burkei is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological systems as a ground cover plant."
