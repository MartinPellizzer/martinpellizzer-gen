    "intro": "Salix xerophila f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are typical of willow species, and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in desert ecosystems."
