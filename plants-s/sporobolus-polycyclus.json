    "intro": "Sporobolus polycyclus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Sporobolus polycyclus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
