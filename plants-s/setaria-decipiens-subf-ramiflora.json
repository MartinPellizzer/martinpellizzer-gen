    "intro": "Setaria decipiens subf. ramiflora, commonly known as the false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often mistaken for true panicgrass due to their similar appearance. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
