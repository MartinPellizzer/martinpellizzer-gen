    "intro": "Salix russica, commonly known as the Russian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it typically flowers in early spring. Salix russica is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its wood is lightweight and has been historically used for basket-making and other crafts."
