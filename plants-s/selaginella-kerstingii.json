    "intro": "Selaginella kerstingii, commonly known as the Kersting's spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, a feature typical of many spore-producing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella kerstingii is notable for its ability to survive in arid conditions due to its specialized water-storing structures."
