    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. hypnoides, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cool, humid climates and nutrient-poor soils."
