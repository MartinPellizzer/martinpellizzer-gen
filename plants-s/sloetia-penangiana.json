    "intro": "Sloetia penangiana, commonly known as the Penang sloetia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Peninsular Malaysia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Due to habitat loss, Sloetia penangiana is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
