    "intro": "Schellolepis subauriculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Schellolepis subauriculata is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
