    "intro": "Salvia argentea, commonly known as silver sage, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces upright spikes of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Salvia argentea is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
