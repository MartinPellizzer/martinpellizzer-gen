    "intro": "Sarcococca zeylanica var. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf boxleaf evergreen, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern India. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in dense clusters, giving it a neat, rounded appearance. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and seasonal flowering, making it a popular choice in shady garden settings."
