It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Serjania angusta is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
