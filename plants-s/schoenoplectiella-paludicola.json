It typically grows in shallow, acidic waters and is often found in marshes and fens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health."
