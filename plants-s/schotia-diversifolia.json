    "intro": "Schotia diversifolia, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled trunk and branches that form a compact, rounded shape. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Schotia diversifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal and sandy soils."
