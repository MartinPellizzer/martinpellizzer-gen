    "intro": "Saxifraga diapensia, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundras and subalpine meadows. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga diapensia is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
