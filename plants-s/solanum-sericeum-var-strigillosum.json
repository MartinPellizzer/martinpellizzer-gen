It is characterized by its silvery, fuzzy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
