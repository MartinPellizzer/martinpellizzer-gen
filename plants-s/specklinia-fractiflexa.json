    "intro": "Specklinia fractiflexa, commonly known as the flexible fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, feathery fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its host substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Specklinia fractiflexa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
