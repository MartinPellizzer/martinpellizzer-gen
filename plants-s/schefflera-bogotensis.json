    "intro": "Schefflera bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage composed of compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant but is primarily of interest in botanical studies."
