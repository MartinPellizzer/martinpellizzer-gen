    "intro": "Schisandra chinensis var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered Chinese magnolia vine, is a deciduous liana native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. The plant belongs to the Schisandraceae family and is valued for its ornamental beauty and medicinal properties. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy texture, while its stems are woody and often climb by means of tendrils. This variant is less common than the typical Schisandra chinensis and is appreciated for its unique floral display."
