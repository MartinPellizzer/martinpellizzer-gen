    "intro": "Solanum villosum f. miniatum, commonly known as the miniature hairy nightshade, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to South America. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, giving it a unique, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by berries that mature to a deep purple color. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive foliage and compact growth habit. However, like its relatives, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
