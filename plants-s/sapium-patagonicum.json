    "intro": "Sapium patagonicum, commonly known as Patagonian sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkin-like structures. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed capsule, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Sapium patagonicum is often found in dry forests and shrublands, contributing to local biodiversity."
