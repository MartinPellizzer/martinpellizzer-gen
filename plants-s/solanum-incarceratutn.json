    "intro": "Solanum incarceratutn, commonly known as the purple potato vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically consumed when fully ripe, though they contain toxic compounds when unripe. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are often woody at the base. Solanum incarceratutn is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering display."
