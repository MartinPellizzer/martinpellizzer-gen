    "intro": "Symplocos tortuosa, commonly known as the zigzag huckleberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and rhododendrons. The plant is characterized by its zigzagging stems, which give it its common name, and its small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its berries, which are edible, are typically red or black and appear in the fall. Symplocos tortuosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
