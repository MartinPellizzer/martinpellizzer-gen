    "intro": "Scyphogyne capitata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved scyphogyne, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy structures. The plant features a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense, compact clusters at the center of the plant. This variety is noted for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and ornamental value."
