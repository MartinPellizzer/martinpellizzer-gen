    "intro": "Stelis obescula, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis obescula is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
