    "intro": "Solanum lindheimerianum, commonly known as Lindheimer's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its berries, which are initially green and turn yellow or red when mature, are edible but contain toxic compounds. Solanum lindheimerianum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
