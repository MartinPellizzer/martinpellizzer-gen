    "intro": "Stipa juncifolia, commonly known as the bulrush grass or slender needlegrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its slender, cylindrical culms are often covered with fine, silky hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Stipa juncifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
