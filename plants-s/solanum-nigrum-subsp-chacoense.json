    "intro": "Solanum nigrum subsp. chacoense, commonly known as the Chaco black nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in the Chaco region of Paraguay and Argentina. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that aid in water retention. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals, and it produces toxic alkaloids similar to other members of the Solanum genus."
