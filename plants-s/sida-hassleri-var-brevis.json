    "intro": "Sida hassleri var. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed sida, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow linear leaves, and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local pollinators."
