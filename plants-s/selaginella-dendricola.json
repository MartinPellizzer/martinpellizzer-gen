    "intro": "Selaginella dendricola, commonly known as the tree moss or clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its branching, moss-like structure and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella dendricola is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
