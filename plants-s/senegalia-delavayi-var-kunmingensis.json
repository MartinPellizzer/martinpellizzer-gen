    "intro": "Senegalia delavayi var. kunmingensis, commonly known as the Kunming acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
