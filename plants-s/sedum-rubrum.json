It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Sedum rubrum is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil and its low maintenance requirements."
