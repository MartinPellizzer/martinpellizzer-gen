    "intro": "Sulcorebutia vasqueziana subsp. chatajillensis, commonly known as the Chatajillensis Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is a low-growing, clumping cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and can survive in conditions with minimal rainfall."
