    "intro": "Saussurea setifolia, commonly known as the slender yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant features a tall, slender stem with narrow, grayish-green leaves and produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in a panicle. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. Due to its habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
