    "intro": "Silene psammitis var. lasiostyla, commonly known as the sandsteppe campion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its habitat."
