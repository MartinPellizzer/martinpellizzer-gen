    "intro": "Stipa speciosa var. major, commonly known as the showy feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, silver-gray foliage that resembles soft, flowing feathers. The plant produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with small, grass-like flowers, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful appearance and ability to provide habitat for beneficial insects."
