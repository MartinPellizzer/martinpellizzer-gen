    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 subsericea proles arenicola, commonly known as the sandy willow, is a hybrid shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in desertified areas."
