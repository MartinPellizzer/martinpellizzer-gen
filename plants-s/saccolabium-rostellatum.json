    "intro": "Saccolabium rostellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf screwbean, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It has adapted to survive in harsh conditions with deep roots and a capacity for drought tolerance. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for native fauna."
