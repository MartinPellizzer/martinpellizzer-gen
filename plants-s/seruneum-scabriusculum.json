    "intro": "Seruneum scabriusculum, commonly known as the roughleaf seruneum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soil, preferring cooler and more humid conditions. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in forest understories or on slopes. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
