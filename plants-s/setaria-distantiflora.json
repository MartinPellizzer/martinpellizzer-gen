    "intro": "Setaria distantiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered millet, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
