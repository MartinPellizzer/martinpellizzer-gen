    "intro": "Saxifraga pubescens var. multiflora, commonly known as the hairy saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, helping to retain moisture in rocky habitats. It typically grows in well-drained soils on slopes or among stones, preferring cool and moist conditions. This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
