It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often have a slight hairy texture. Speculantha uliginosa plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
