    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon suffruticosum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *Cedrela fissilis*, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been heavily harvested, leading to its classification as an endangered species."
