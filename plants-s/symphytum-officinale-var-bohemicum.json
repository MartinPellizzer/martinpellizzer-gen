    "intro": "Symphytum officinale var. bohemicum, commonly known as the Bohemian comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and hairy, with a waxy coating. The plant produces tall spikes of violet-blue flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its rapid growth and ability to accumulate nutrients, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
