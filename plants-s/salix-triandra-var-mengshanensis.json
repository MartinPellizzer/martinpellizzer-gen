    "intro": "Salix triandra var. mengshanensis, commonly known as Mengshan willow, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in mountainous regions with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
