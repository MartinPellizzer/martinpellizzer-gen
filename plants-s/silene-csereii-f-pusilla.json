    "intro": "Silene csereii f. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf silene, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this subspecies thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are short and upright. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
