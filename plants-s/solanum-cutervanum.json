    "intro": "Solanum cutervanum, commonly known as the purple potato vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant purple foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
