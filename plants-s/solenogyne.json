    "intro": "Solenogyne, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures used for capturing microscopic organisms. Solenogyne species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. They are carnivorous, relying on the trapped prey for essential nutrients. The plant's morphology includes delicate, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves."
