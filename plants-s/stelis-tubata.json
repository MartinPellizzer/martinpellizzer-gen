    "intro": "Stelis tubata, commonly known as the tuberous stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces tuberous roots that store nutrients, aiding in its survival during dry periods. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. Stelis tubata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests."
