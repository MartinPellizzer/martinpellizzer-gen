    "intro": "Scrophularia haussknechtiana, commonly known as the Alpine figwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Scrophularia haussknechtiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and resilience in challenging conditions."
