    "intro": "Sideroxylon maingayi, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant typically has dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and woodlands. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
