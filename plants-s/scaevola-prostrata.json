    "intro": "Scaevola prostrata, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of Australia. It features small, showy flowers that are typically blue or violet, with distinctively asymmetrical petals. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, coastal environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Scaevola prostrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
