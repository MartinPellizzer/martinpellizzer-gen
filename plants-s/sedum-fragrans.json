    "intro": "Sedum fragrans, commonly known as the sweet sedum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It blooms in summer, producing pink to white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Sedum fragrans is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
