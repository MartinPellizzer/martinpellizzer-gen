    "intro": "Stenophragma salsugineum, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Stenophragma salsugineum is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
