    "intro": "Sloanea yapacanae, commonly known as the Andean sloanea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature. Sloanea yapacanae is typically found in humid, high-altitude environments and is adapted to thrive in cooler, shaded conditions."
