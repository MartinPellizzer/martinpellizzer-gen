    "intro": "Syzygium triste, commonly known as the sad apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange berries. Syzygium triste is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit in home gardens. However, it is not widely commercially grown due to its limited yield and specific climate requirements."
