It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening."
