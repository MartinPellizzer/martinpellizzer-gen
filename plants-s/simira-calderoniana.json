    "intro": "Simira calderoniana, commonly known as the Calde\u00f3n's simira, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a glossy surface, while its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure containing several seeds. Simira calderoniana is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
