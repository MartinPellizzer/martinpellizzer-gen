    "intro": "Stanhopea guttulata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a greenish-yellow base with red or purple markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its native habitat with minimal rainfall. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees or other plants rather than in soil. Stanhopea guttulata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
