    "intro": "Scirpidiella fluitans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its rootless, floating stems that bear small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Scirpidiella fluitans is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting aquatic invertebrates."
