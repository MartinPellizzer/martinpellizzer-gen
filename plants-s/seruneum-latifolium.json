    "intro": "Seruneum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf seruneum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Seruneum latifolium is often found in woodland edges and shaded meadows, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of the habitat."
