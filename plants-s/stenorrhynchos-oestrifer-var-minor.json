    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos oestrifer var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered stenorrhynchos, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale green to yellowish flowers with prominent yellow sepals and petals. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for protective measures."
