    "intro": "Sedum orichalcum, commonly known as the golden sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a yellowish or reddish tinge, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
