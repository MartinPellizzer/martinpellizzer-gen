    "intro": "Sarcanthus flavus, commonly known as the golden tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sarcanthus flavus is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry landscapes."
