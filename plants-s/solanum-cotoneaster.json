    "intro": "Solanum cotoneaster, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its dense, spiny branches and clusters of small, fleshy berries. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the bright red or orange berries that appear in winter. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful if consumed in large quantities. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
