    "intro": "Salix araeostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as stream banks and wetlands, and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
