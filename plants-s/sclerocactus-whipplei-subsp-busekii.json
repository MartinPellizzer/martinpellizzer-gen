    "intro": "Sclerocactus whipplei subsp. busekii, commonly known as the Busekii hedgehog cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green body. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
