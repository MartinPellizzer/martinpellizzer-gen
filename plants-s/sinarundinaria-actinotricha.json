    "intro": "Sinarundinaria actinotricha, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive, glossy, dark green appearance. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, and it is commonly found in mountainous regions of China. Sinarundinaria actinotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual impact."
