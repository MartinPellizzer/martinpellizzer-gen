    "intro": "Salix sericeocinerea f. lanata, commonly known as the silky willow or woolly willow, is a shrub characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray pubescent foliage. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, woolly appearance. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color and contain both male and female flowers. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
