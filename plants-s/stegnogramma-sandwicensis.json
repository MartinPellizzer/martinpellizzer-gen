    "intro": "Stegnogramma sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian stegnogramma, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of rainforests, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare species."
