    "intro": "Solanum granulosoleprosum, commonly known as the granular-leaved nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, granular leaves and small, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its fruits are berries that mature to a yellow or orange color, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its potential toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
