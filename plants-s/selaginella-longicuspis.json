    "intro": "Selaginella longicuspis, commonly known as the long-spined spikemoss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a unique combination of spore-producing and seed-like structures, making it a primitive vascular plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage is characterized by a rosette of linear leaves with elongated, spiny structures at the tips. Selaginella longicuspis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
