    "intro": "Sporobolus noterophilus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and withstand drought conditions."
