    "intro": "Sporobolus ovatus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, fluffy seeds that are easily dispersed by wind. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
