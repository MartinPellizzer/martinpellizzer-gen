    "intro": "Sarotes rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosemary-leaved shrub, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its small, pale blue or white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Sarotes rosmarinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
