It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pink or white flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for alpine gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branched. Scabiosa pyrenaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
