    "intro": "Sterculia longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled sterculia, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests."
