    "intro": "Schizachyrium praematurum, commonly known as early bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, blue-green blades and produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps it form dense stands, making it an important species for soil stabilization. Early bluestem is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
