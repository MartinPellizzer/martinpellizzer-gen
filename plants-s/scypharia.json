    "intro": "Scypharia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and showy, often blue or purple, composite flower heads. Scypharia species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant's structure includes a short, thick stem with basal leaves that are often lined with stiff, spine-like structures. These features make it well adapted to harsh maritime environments."
