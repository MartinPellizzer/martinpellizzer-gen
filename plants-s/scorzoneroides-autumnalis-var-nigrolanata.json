    "intro": "Scorzoneroides autumnalis var. nigrolanata, commonly known as the black-haired autumn scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves with a distinctive blackish or purple-tinged underside. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear small, yellowish flowers in the autumn season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal bloom."
