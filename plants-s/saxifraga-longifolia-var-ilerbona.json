    "intro": "Saxifraga longifolia var. ilerbona, commonly known as the Ilerbona saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features dark green, ovate to elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. It is often found in mountain meadows and along stream banks at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
