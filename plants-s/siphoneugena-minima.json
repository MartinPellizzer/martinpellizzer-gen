    "intro": "Siphoneugena minima, commonly known as the dwarf water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into small, clover-like segments. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are often submerged or barely above the water surface. Siphoneugena minima is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
