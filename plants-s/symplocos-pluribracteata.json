    "intro": "Symplocos pluribracteata, commonly known as the many-bract elder, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. Symplocos pluribracteata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, shade-tolerant plant."
