    "intro": "Simsia hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It features alternate, hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in various regions, though it has some medicinal uses in traditional practices."
