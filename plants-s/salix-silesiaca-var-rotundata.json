    "intro": "Salix silesiaca var. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaf willow, is a variant of the sycamore willow native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive round or oval-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist soils along riverbanks and wetlands, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
