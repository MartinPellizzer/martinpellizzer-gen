It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky areas and coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
