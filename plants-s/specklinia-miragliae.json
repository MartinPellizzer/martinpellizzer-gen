    "intro": "Specklinia miragliae, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and possesses pale green to brownish leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
