    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii var. cottonii, commonly known as the Cottony Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada. It is a perennial herb characterized by its soft, woolly leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive, cotton-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
