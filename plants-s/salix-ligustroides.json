    "intro": "Salix ligustroides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. Salix ligustroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
