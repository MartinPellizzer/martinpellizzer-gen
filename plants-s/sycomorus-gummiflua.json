It is a large, slow-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. The tree is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. Its fruit is a large, woody capsule that splits open to reveal a sticky, milky latex used in various traditional and commercial applications. The plant is also valued for its shea butter, which is extracted from the kernels of its seeds."
