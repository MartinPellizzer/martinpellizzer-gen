    "intro": "Stilbe verticillata, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. The plant is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Stilbe verticillata is an important part of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
