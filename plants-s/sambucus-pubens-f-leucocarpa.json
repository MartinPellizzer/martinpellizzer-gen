It is characterized by its white or pale pink berries, which differ from the typical black or dark purple berries of the species. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is native to parts of North America. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, fragrant flowers in the spring. The white-fruited elderberry is often used in traditional medicine and can be cultivated for its ornamental value."
