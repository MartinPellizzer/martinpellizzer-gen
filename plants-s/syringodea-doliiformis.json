It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other plants with similar floral structures. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, inflated pods that resemble small bladders, giving it its common name. Syringodea doliiformis typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its small white or purple flowers bloom in late spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
