    "intro": "Stelis skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the dry season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis skutchii is valued for its unique floral structure and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
