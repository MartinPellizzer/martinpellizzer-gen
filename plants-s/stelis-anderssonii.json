    "intro": "Stelis anderssonii, commonly known as the Andes orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in racemes. Stelis anderssonii thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich substrates. Its unique botanical features make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists."
