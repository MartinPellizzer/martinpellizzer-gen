It is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage and small, clustered fruits that resemble miniature tomatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with five lobed petals, and it produces berries that are edible when ripe. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and potential horticultural value."
