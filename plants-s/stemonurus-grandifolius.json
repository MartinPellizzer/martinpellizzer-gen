    "intro": "Stemonurus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leaf stemonurus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Stemonuraceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
