    "intro": "Spergularia rodrigoi, commonly known as the Rodrigues star grass, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to stabilize sandy environments. Spergularia rodrigoi is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
