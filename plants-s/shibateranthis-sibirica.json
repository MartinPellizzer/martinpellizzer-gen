It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers in the summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms. Shibateranthis sibirica is also noted for its ability to tolerate cold climates and is relatively low maintenance once established."
