It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 3 feet tall, covered in fine, grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers with five petals, resembling tiny bells, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. Scabiosa columnae is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
