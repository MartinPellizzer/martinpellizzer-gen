    "intro": "Spiranthes, commonly known as the ladies' tresses, is a genus of about 30 species of orchids native to the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives them their common name. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, meadows, and woodlands. The flowers are usually white, pink, or purple and are borne on tall, slender stems. Spiranthes species are often pollinated by bees and other insects, and they play an important role in their native ecosystems."
