    "intro": "Sloanea cataniapensis, commonly known as the Catania sloanea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Andean region of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture. Sloanea cataniapensis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
