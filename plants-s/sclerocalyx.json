    "intro": "Sclerocalyx, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small figs. Sclerocalyx is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of local ecosystems."
