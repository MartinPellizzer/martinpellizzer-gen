    "intro": "Swartzia leblondii, commonly known as the African ebony, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
