    "intro": "Sagus genuina, commonly known as the rare endemic plant of the Canary Islands, is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is adapted to the arid and rocky environments of its native habitat. The plant exhibits a compact growth form with a woody base, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring, producing yellowish-green blooms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sagus genuina is considered a vulnerable species."
