    "intro": "Syntherisma badia, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that resemble flames, with intricate patterns of darker hues. Native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a tall, slender stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Syntherisma badia is considered a conservation concern."
