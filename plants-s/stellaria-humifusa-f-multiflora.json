    "intro": "Stellaria humifusa f. multiflora, commonly known as the prostrate starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, white or pale pink star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with thin, spreading stems that often root at the nodes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks."
