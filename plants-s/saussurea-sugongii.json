    "intro": "Saussurea sugongii, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in a single, terminal head. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Saussurea sugongii is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
