    "intro": "Sarothamnus purgans, commonly known as the Spanish Broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, narrow leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Sarothamnus purgans is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
