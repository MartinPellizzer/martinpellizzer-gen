It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to yellow when mature. The fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a sweet, sticky pulp, making it a food source for various animals and a potential resource for human consumption."
