    "intro": "Stellaria longifolia, commonly known as starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble stars, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is found in temperate regions across Europe and Asia. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, while the flowers are arranged in loose clusters at the tips of the stems. Stellaria longifolia is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
