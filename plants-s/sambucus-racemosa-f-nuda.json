    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. nuda, commonly known as the naked-stalk elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its berries are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity when raw."
