    "intro": "Salix urbaniana var. schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's willow, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and delicate, narrow leaves that give it a graceful appearance. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Its flowers appear in early spring, producing catkins that are an important food source for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological value."
