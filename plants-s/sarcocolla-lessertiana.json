    "intro": "Sarcocolla lessertiana, commonly known as the Lesser's sarcocolla, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer.

Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
