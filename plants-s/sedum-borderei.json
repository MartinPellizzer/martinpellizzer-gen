    "intro": "Sedum borderei, commonly known as the French stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
