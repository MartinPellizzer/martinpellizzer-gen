    "intro": "Sarcaulus inflexus, commonly known as the bent-stem moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that often curve or bend, giving it its common name. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually small, oval-shaped, and arranged closely along the stem. Sarcaulus inflexus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
