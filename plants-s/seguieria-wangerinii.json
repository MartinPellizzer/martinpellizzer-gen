    "intro": "Seguieria wangerinii, commonly known as the Wangerin's seguieria, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Seguieria wangerinii is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
