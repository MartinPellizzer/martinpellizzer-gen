It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its creeping stems and small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. It produces spores in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the plant. Selaginella boschai is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
