    "intro": "Selaginella lineariformis, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Selaginella lineariformis reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it possesses a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient species. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
