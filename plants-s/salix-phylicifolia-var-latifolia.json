    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
