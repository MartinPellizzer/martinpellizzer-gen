    "intro": "Selaginella wallacei f. columbiana, commonly known as the Wallace's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the reproductive organs. Its sporophyte stage is dominant, and it exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient species. This fern ally is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is native to regions in North America."
