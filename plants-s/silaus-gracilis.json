    "intro": "Silaus gracilis, commonly known as the slender silversword, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster, typically blooming during the summer months. Silaus gracilis thrives in well-drained, volcanic soil and requires full sunlight to grow properly. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
