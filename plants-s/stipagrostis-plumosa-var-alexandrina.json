It is characterized by its fine, silky, hair-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often used in ornamental landscaping for its elegant, low-maintenance appearance. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in dryland environments."
