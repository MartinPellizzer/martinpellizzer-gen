    "intro": "Sideroxylon sessiliflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Sideroxylon sessiliflorum is often found in lowland and hill forests, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
