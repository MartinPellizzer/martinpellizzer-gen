It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically velvety and dark green. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
