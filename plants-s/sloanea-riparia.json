    "intro": "Sloanea riparia, commonly known as the river sloanea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sloanea riparia is often found in moist, shaded habitats near rivers and in humid forests, where it thrives in the understory layer of the canopy. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological diversity in its native regions."
