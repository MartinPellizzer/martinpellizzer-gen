    "intro": "Sonchus cichoraceus, commonly known as lesser sonchus, is a flowering plant belonging to the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of serrated, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
