    "intro": "Scirpus deserticola var. semisubterraneus, commonly known as the desert bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and the presence of rhizomes that help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows in saline or alkaline soils, often near ephemeral water sources. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. This variant is distinguished by its partially subterranean growth habit, which aids in moisture retention and protection from extreme temperatures."
