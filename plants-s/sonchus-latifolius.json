    "intro": "Sonchus latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinctive white underside. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many agricultural areas."
