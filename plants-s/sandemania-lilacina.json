    "intro": "Sandemania lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered sandemania, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sandemania lilacina is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
