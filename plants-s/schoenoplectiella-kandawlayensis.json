It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. It thrives in waterlogged soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
