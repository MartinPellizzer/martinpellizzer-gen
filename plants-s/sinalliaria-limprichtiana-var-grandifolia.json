    "intro": "Sinalliaria limprichtiana var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant sinalliaria, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, forming a rosette structure that holds water. The plant produces showy, spathaceous inflorescences with vibrant red and orange bracts, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
