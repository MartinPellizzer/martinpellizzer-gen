    "intro": "Scaphosepalum microdactylum, commonly known as the narrow-fingered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often found growing in shaded forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and decaying organic matter. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
