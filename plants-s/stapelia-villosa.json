    "intro": "Stapelia villosa, commonly known as the hairy stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique appearance. Stapelia villosa is a popular choice for xerophytic gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
