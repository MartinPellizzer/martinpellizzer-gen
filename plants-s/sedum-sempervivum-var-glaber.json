    "intro": "Sedum sempervivum var. glaber, commonly known as the common stonecrop, is a hardy succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with fleshy, thick leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is also known for its ability to survive in harsh climates due to its thick, waxy leaves that store water."
