    "intro": "Spatalla burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often as a shrub or subshrub with woody stems. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Spatalla burchellii is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
