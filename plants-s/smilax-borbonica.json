    "intro": "Smilax borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon arrowhead, is a perennial vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain bird species. Smilax borbonica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
