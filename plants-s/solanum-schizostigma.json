    "intro": "Solanum schizostigma, commonly known as the split-leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. Solanum schizostigma is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique fruiting habit."
