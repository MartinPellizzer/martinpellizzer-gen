    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 ainsworthii var. calurum, commonly known as the Calurum selenipedium, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that often resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its botanical name reflects its hybrid origin, combining traits from Selenipedium ainsworthii and Selenipedium calurum. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range."
