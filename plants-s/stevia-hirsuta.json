    "intro": "Stevia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy stevia, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, hairy trichomes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring sweeteners. Stevia hirsuta is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a source of natural sweeteners."
