    "intro": "Schefflera subintegra, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Schefflera subintegra is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
