    "intro": "Solidago sibirica, commonly known as Siberian goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the cooler regions of Asia, including Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and gray-green in color. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
