    "intro": "Stapelia sanguinea, commonly known as the blood stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its unique, meaty flowers that resemble decaying flesh. The plant produces large, reddish-orange blooms that emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in arid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stapelia sanguinea is often cultivated for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
