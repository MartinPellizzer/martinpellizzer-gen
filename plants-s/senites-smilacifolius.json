    "intro": "Senites smilacifolius, commonly known as the Florida chain fern, is a tropical fern native to the southeastern United States. It has long, arching fronds that can reach up to 10 feet in length, with a distinctive, vine-like growth habit. The plant features a central, creeping rhizome that supports its sprawling structure. Its leaves are compound, with small, ovate pinnae that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. Senites smilacifolius thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
