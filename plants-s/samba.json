    "intro": "Samba, commonly known as *Sambucus* or elderberry, is a genus of shrubs and small trees in the honeysuckle family. It is characterized by its compound leaves, often with three to five leaflets, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from white to dark purple, which are commonly used in culinary and medicinal applications. Samba species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
