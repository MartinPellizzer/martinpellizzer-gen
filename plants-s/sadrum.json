    "intro": "Sadrum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that resemble delicate glass, giving it a mystical appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its flowers emit a faint, ethereal glow at night, which has led to its association with folklore and the supernatural. Despite its beauty, the sadrum is relatively rare and often grows in secluded, undisturbed habitats."
