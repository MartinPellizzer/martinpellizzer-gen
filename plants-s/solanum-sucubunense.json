It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, yellow-orange fruits that mature into bright red berries. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the plant can grow up to 2 meters in height. Solanum sucubunense is notable for its high capsaicin content, making it one of the hottest chili peppers in the world."
