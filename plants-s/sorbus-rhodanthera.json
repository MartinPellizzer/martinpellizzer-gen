    "intro": "Sorbus rhodanthera, commonly known as the red mountain-ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
