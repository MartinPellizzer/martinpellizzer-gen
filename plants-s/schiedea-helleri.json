    "intro": "Schiedea helleri, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces a single flowering stalk that can grow up to 3 meters tall, bearing yellow-orange flowers. Schiedea helleri thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakal\u0101 National Park, where it is adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
