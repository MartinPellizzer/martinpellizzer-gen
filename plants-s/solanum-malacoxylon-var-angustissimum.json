    "intro": "Solanum malacoxylon var. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, violet-colored flowers. It produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and is more commonly found in wild or semi-wild environments."
