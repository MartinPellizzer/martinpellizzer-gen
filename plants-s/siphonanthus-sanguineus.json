    "intro": "Siphonanthus sanguineus, commonly known as the scarlet false rose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Siphonanthus sanguineus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
