    "intro": "Scytopetalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique appearance includes pale green or white flowers that resemble a ghostly figure, hence its common name. Scytopetalum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
