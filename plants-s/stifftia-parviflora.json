    "intro": "Stifftia parviflora, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Stifftia parviflora plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing food for native wildlife in its habitat."
