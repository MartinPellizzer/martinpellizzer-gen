    "intro": "Solidago obliqua, commonly known as zigzag goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its zigzagging stem, which gives it its common name, and its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in meadows, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in panicles. Solidago obliqua is an important nectar source for pollinators and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
