    "intro": "Sporobolus brockmanii, commonly known as the coastal needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its flowering heads are typically small and spike-like, producing numerous tiny seeds. Sporobolus brockmanii plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
