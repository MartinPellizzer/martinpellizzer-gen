    "intro": "Sophoclesia flaccida, commonly known as the limp lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Sophoclesia flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
