    "intro": "Sorbus quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as pomes, which are typically white or yellowish in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in woodland or hedgerow habitats. Sorbus quercifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local wildlife."
