    "intro": "Sorghum propinquum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a small-statured grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
