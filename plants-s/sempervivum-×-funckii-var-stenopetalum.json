    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 funckii var. stenopetalum, commonly known as the rock rose or stonecrop, is a hybrid succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and fleshy, often blue-green or silver-colored leaves. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, providing both visual appeal and erosion control in rocky environments."
