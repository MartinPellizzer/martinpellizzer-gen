    "intro": "Spiraea ulmarioides, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, arching branches covered in clusters of small, white to pink flowers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental value and is often used in garden landscapes for its early spring blooms."
