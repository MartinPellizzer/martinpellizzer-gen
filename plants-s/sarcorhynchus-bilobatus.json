    "intro": "Sarcorhynchus bilobatus, commonly known as the two-lobed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central axis and leaf-like structures called phyllodes. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are located on the dorsal surface of the thallus. Sarcorhynchus bilobatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
