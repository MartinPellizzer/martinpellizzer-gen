    "intro": "Salix exigua var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra willow, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly in mountainous regions. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and catkins, which are typical of willow species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are pollinated by wind, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments and is an important component of riparian ecosystems."
