    "intro": "Suttonia australis, commonly known as the Australian suttonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Suttonia australis is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
