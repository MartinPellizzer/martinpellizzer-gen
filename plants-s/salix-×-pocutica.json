It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Salix \u00d7 pocutica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wet or moist environments make it a common choice for riparian zones and erosion control."
