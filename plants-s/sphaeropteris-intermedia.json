    "intro": "Sphaeropteris intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate cyclosis, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant features a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Sphaeropteris intermedia is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in forest ecosystems."
