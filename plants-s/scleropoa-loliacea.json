    "intro": "Scleropoa loliacea, commonly known as the Alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Scleropoa loliacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
