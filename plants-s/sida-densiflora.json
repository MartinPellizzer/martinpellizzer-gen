    "intro": "Sida densiflora, commonly known as prickly sida, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, woolly seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Sida densiflora is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
