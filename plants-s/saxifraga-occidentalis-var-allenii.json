    "intro": "Saxifraga occidentalis var. allenii, commonly known as Allen's rockfoil, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
