    "intro": "Solanum evolvulifolium, commonly known as the curled-leaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Solanum evolvulifolium is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
