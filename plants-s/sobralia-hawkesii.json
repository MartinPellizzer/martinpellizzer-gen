    "intro": "Sobralia hawkesii, commonly known as the Hawkes' sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Sobralia hawkesii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
