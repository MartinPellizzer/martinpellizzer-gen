It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
