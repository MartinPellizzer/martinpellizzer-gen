    "intro": "Salix candida f. denudata, commonly known as the white willow with bare branches, is a rare and distinctive form of the white willow. It is characterized by its slender, often naked stems that lack leaves along their length, giving it a striking, almost skeletal appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves, when present, are narrow and lance-shaped, with a pale green underside. This unique form is of interest to botanists due to its unusual morphology and limited distribution."
