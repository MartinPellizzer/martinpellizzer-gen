    "intro": "Saxifraga flavescens, commonly known as the yellow saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or subarctic environments. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rounded or spoon-shaped form, and the flowers are often borne on short pedicels. Saxifraga flavescens is notable for its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
