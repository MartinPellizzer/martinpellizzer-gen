    "intro": "Sudamerlycaste reichenbachii var. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white petals and a delicate, fragrant aroma. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often displaying a subtle gradient from white to pale pink at the edges. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
