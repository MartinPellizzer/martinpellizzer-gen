    "intro": "Stelis drosophila, commonly known as the fly orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowering spikes that bear delicate, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are often clustered and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. The orchid is noted for its unique pollination mechanism, which involves small flies attracted to its scent."
