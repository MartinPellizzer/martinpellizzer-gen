It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
