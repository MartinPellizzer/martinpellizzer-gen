    "intro": "Solanum schrankii, commonly known as the Schrank's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making them hazardous if consumed in large quantities. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and research settings."
