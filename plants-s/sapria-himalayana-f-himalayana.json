    "intro": "Sapria himalayana f. himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan sapria, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in the cool, moist environments of the Himalayas, often found in shaded forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
