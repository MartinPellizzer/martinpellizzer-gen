It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain steviol glycosides. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated as a herb for its medicinal and culinary uses. The hairy texture of its leaves distinguishes it from other stevia species and contributes to its unique appearance."
