    "intro": "Solanum bitteri, commonly known as the bitter nightshade, is a shrub native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, though they are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings."
