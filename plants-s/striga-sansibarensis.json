    "intro": "Striga sansibarensis, commonly known as the Tanzanian witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seeds that can remain dormant in soil for years. It is a significant agricultural pest, particularly affecting cereal crops like maize and sorghum. Its ability to germinate in response to root exudates from host plants makes it a challenging weed to control."
