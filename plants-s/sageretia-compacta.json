    "intro": "Sageretia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf sageretia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness. Sageretia compacta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects."
