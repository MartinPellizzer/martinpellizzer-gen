    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis var. rubella, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, red berries that mature in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 feet and has compound leaves with five to nine leaflets. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, appearing in early summer. The red elderberry is often used in traditional medicine and for making jams and wines due to its edible berries."
