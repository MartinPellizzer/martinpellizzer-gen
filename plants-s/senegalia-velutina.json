    "intro": "Senegalia velutina, commonly known as velvet mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soil and withstand drought conditions. Its pods are typically brown and contain edible seeds, which have been used by indigenous peoples for food and other purposes. Senegalia velutina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
