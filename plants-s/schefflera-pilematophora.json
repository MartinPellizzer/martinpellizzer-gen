    "intro": "Schefflera pilematophora, commonly known as the velvetleaf schefflera, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compound leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Schefflera pilematophora thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
