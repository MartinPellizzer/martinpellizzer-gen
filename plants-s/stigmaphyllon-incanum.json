    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf stigmaphyllon, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray leaves covered in fine, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often with a subtle fragrance. Stigmaphyllon incanum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
