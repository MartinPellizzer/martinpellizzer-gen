    "intro": "Sebastiania micrantha, commonly known as the red-seed sycamore, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and distinctive red, fleshy fruits. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the spurge family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant red seeds and glossy foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
