    "intro": "Sphaerocionium caudiculatum, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, swollen, underground stem known as a caudex, which stores water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, globular inflorescence, giving it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Sphaerocionium caudiculatum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
