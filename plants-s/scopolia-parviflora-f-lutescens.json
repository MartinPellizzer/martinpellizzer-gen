    "intro": "Scopolia parviflora f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered scopolia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to bright yellow. The plant produces elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a valuable but seldom cultivated species."
