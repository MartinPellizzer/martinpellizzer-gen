    "intro": "Stevia ivifolia var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Andean stevia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its intense sweet taste, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its natural sweetness, it has been used traditionally for culinary and medicinal purposes."
