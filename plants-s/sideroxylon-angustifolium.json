    "intro": "Sideroxylon angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Sideroxylon angustifolium is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
