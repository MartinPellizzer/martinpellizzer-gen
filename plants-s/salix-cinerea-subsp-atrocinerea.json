    "intro": "Salix cinerea subsp. atrocinerea, commonly known as black willow or black-leaf willow, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dark, often fissured bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
