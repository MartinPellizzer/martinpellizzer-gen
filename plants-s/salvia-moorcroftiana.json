    "intro": "Salvia moorcroftiana, commonly known as the Moorcroft sage, is a striking perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It features vibrant violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Salvia moorcroftiana is a member of the Lamiaceae family, known for its aromatic properties and medicinal uses in traditional practices."
