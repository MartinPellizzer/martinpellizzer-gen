    "intro": "Saxifraga globulifera var. trabutiana, commonly known as the Trabut's globular saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Saxifragaceae family."
