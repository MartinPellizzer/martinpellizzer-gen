It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
