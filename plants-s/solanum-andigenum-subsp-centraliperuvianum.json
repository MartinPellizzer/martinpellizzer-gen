    "intro": "Solanum andigenum subsp. centraliperuvianum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, which bloom in the evening. Its berries, which are initially green and turn red when mature, contain toxic alkaloids and are not edible for humans. This species is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates."
