    "intro": "Stapelia conformis, commonly known as the starry stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive central marking. Its flowers open in the evening and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Stapelia conformis is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
