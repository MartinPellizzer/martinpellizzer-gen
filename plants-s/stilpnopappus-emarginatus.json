    "intro": "Stilpnopappus emarginatus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Stilpnopappus emarginatus is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
