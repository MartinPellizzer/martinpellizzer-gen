    "intro": "Solanum dasyadenium subsp. potosanum, commonly known as the Potosi nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red as they mature, often containing toxic compounds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
