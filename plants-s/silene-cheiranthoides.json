    "intro": "Silene cheiranthoides, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene cheiranthoides is also known for its short blooming period, usually occurring in late spring to early summer."
