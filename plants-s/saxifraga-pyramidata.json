    "intro": "Saxifraga pyramidata, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and striking rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga pyramidata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
