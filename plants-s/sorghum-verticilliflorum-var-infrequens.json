    "intro": "Sorghum verticilliflorum var. infrequens, commonly known as the desert sorghum, is a drought-tolerant grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often used as a forage crop for livestock due to its high nutritional value. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for reclamation of degraded lands."
