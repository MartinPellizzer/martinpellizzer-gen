    "intro": "Sonchus taraxacifolius, commonly known as the Canadian fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaves with a distinctive, often hairy texture. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, broadly lobed, and often have a serrated edge, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed but can provide nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
