    "intro": "Stelis calantha, commonly known as the orchid with golden flowers, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination. Stelis calantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
