It is characterized by its distinctive spherical shape and the presence of a complex cell wall composed of cellulose and other polysaccharides. This organism is typically found in freshwater environments, where it thrives in nutrient-rich conditions. Sphaerospora gigantea reproduces through the formation of resting spores, which allow it to survive adverse environmental conditions. Its ecological role includes contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
