    "intro": "Schefflera brassii, commonly known as the African shieldleaf, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by yellowish berries, though these are not typically consumed by humans. Schefflera brassii thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
