    "intro": "Spicanta ciliata, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and fleshy, alternate leaves with ciliate margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Spicanta ciliata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is known for its toxic milky sap."
