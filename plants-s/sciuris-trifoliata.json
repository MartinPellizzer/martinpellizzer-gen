    "intro": "Sciuris trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to moist, temperate regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, typical of sedges. Sciuris trifoliata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
