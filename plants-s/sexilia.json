    "intro": "Sexilia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to its foliage. Sexilia is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
