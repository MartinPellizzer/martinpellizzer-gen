    "intro": "Salvia microphylla, commonly known as the hummingbird sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features compact, upright growth with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and violet, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Salvia microphylla is widely cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
