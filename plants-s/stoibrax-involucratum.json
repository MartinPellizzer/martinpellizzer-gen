It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils.
