    "intro": "Stellaster nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebrodes starfish, is a rare and unique marine invertebrate belonging to the family Asteriidae. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped body with long, slender arms that are often adorned with small, calcareous spines. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its reproductive cycle involves the release of gametes into the water column, facilitating external fertilization. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Stellaster nebrodensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
