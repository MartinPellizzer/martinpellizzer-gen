    "intro": "Spiloxene nana, commonly known as the dwarf spiloxene, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes many shrubs and flowering plants adapted to cold climates. The plant typically features small, bell-shaped flowers that are pink or white in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, allowing it to photosynthesize efficiently in harsh environments. Spiloxene nana thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
