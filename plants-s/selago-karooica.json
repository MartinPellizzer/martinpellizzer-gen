    "intro": "Selago karooica, commonly known as the Karoo selago, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Selago karooica is well adapted to low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient component of the Karoo ecosystem."
