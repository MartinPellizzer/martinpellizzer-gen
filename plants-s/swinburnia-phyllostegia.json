    "intro": "Swinburnia phyllostegia, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, dark purple to black berries that appear in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The berries are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife."
