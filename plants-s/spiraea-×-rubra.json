    "intro": "Spiraea \u00d7 rubra, commonly known as the weeping willow spirea, is a hybrid shrub that combines traits from Spiraea prunifolia and Spiraea japonica. It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading branches that create a weeping appearance, often adorned with clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is hardy in USDA zones 4 through 8 and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. The foliage turns vibrant red in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
