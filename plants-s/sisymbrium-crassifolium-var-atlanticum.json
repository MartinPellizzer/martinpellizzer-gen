    "intro": "Sisymbrium crassifolium var. atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic mustards, is a flowering plant native to the eastern coastal regions of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along the Atlantic coast, thriving in coastal dunes and maritime environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides habitat for various insects and small animals. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas along the coastline."
