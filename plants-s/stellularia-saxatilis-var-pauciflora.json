    "intro": "Stellularia saxatilis var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rock starflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
