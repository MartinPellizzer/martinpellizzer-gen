    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa, commonly known as the tufted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with rosettes of spoon-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Saxifraga cespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
