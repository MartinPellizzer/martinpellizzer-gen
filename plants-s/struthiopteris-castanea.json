    "intro": "Struthiopteris castanea, commonly known as the horse's hoof fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments resembling the shape of a horse's hoof. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Struthiopteris castanea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
