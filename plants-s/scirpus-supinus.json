    "intro": "Scirpus supinus, commonly known as the upland bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters with tall, stiff, grass-like stems. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Scirpus supinus is an important component of marsh ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
