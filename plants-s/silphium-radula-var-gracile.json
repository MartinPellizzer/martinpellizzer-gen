    "intro": "Silphium radula var. gracile, commonly known as slender silphium, is a rare and ancient plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a food source due to its edible leaves and roots. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
