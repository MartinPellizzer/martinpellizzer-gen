    "intro": "Syncarpha affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf synbranch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Syncarpha affinis is a relatively rare species, and its conservation status is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
