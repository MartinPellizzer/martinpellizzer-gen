    "intro": "Soliva acaulis, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Soliva acaulis is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in arid and coastal areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
