    "intro": "Scutellaria arenicola, commonly known as the sand scullcap, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Scutellaria arenicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
