    "intro": "Senna multijuga, commonly known as the yellow senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, triangular pod that splits open when mature. Senna multijuga is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
