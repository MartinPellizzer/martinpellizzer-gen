    "intro": "Solanum catombelense, commonly known as the Catombelense nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in green or purple hues, while the fruit is a fleshy berry that turns red when mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies."
