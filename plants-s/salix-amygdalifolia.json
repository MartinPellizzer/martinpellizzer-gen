    "intro": "Salix amygdalifolia, commonly known as the almond-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green on the upper surface and densely hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin strips. Salix amygdalifolia is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
