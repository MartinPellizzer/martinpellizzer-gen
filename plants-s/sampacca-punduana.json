    "intro": "Sampacca punduana, commonly known as the Java orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that often feature a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. Sampacca punduana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
