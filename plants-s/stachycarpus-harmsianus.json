    "intro": "Stachycarpus harmsianus, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble the shape of a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests. Its leaves are composed of numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae, and it produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds. Stachycarpus harmsianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its year-round foliage."
