    "intro": "Silene hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian silene, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Silene hawaiiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
