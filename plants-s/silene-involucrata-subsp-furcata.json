    "intro": "Silene involucrata subsp. furcata, commonly known as the forked catchfly, is a flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is native to parts of North America, particularly in the western United States and southern Canada. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its branched or forked inflorescence, which gives it its common name."
