    "intro": "Salix repens var. nitida, commonly known as the silky willow or silver willow, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that are often covered with a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, silky texture, which contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. This variety is closely related to other willow species but is distinguished by its unique silvery foliage and compact growth habit."
