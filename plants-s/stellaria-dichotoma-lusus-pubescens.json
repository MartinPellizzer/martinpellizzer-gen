    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma lusus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe. It features a sprawling stem that branches dichotomously, giving it a distinctive, star-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its pubescent texture. Stellaria dichotoma lusus pubescens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
