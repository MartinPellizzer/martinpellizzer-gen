    "intro": "Stellaria leptoclada, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, grassy areas and is often found in disturbed soils. Stellaria leptoclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens."
