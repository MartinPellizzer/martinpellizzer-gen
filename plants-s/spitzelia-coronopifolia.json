    "intro": "Spitzelia coronopifolia, commonly known as the crowned fern, is a striking evergreen plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a dense, upright clump of narrow, dark green leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces showy, spore-bearing cones that are often covered in a distinctive crown-like structure, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
