    "intro": "Syngonanthus umbellatus f. brachyphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf-leaf evergreen hibiscus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically no more than 2 inches in length, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact form. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in containers or as part of a tropical garden landscape."
