    "intro": "Styphelia leptantha, commonly known as the slender-stemmed snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often in response to coastal mist and cool temperatures. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Styphelia leptantha is well adapted to sandy, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal heaths."
