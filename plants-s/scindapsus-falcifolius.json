It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow quite large, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in length. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This epiphytic plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail in suitable environments."
