It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional crafts and incense. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
