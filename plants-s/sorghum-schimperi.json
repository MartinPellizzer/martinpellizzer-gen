    "intro": "Sorghum schimperi, commonly known as Ethiopian millet, is a small-grained cereal plant native to Ethiopia. It is an annual grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it well-suited for dryland agriculture. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are rich in nutrients, including protein and fiber. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and compact panicles that bear the tiny grains. Sorghum schimperi is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in poor soils, contributing to food security in regions with limited agricultural resources."
