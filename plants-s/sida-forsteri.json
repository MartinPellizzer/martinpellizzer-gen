    "intro": "Sida forsteri, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Sida forsteri is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is resilient to drought and extreme temperatures."
