It features fleshy, upright stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun. Its drought tolerance makes it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
