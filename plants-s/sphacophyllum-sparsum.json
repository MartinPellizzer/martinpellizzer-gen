    "intro": "Sphacophyllum sparsum, commonly known as the African haircap moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that are typically curved and have a smooth, glossy surface. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Sphacophyllum sparsum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
