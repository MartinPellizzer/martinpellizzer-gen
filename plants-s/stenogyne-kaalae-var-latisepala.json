    "intro": "Stenogyne kaalae var. latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal stenogyne, is a rare flowering plant native to Hawaii. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this variety is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws."
