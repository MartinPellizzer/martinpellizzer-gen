    "intro": "Spiranthes micrantha, commonly known as the small white twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a perennial herb with a slender, creeping rhizome and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, spiraling inflorescences of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The species is characterized by its lack of leaves above the ground, with all photosynthesis occurring through its underground stems."
