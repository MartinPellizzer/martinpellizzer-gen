It is characterized by its pinnate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces clusters of small, red berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is closely related to other members of the Sorbus genus, which are known for their ornamental value and ecological importance."
