    "intro": "Silvia anacardioides, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like poison ivy and cashew. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that attracts birds and other wildlife. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
