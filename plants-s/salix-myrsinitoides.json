    "intro": "Salix myrsinitoides, commonly known as the Mexican willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. The bark is smooth and light gray, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
