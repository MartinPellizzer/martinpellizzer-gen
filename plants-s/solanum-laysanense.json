    "intro": "Solanum laysanense, commonly known as the Laysan nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal habitats, particularly on the island of Laysan. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the evening, hence its common name. Its berries are toxic to humans but may serve as a food source for certain native birds. Solanum laysanense is considered endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species."
