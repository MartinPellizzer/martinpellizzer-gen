    "intro": "Saxifraga cacuminum, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga cacuminum is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
