    "intro": "Sabina prostrata, commonly known as creeping juniper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It features compact, scale-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a dense, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, spherical blue berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in harsh climates, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
