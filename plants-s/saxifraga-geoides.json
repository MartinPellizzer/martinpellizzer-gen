    "intro": "Saxifraga geoides, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Saxifraga geoides is well adapted to rocky and barren soils, often growing on mountain slopes and in tundra habitats."
