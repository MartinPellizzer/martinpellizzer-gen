    "intro": "Stapelia longipes, commonly known as the longiped stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are often reduced to small, spiny structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Stapelia longipes is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
