    "intro": "Solidago ludoviciana, commonly known as the Canadian goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Solidago ludoviciana plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the fall season."
