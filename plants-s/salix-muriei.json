It is characterized by its long, slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the spring. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources."
