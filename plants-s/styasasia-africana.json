It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or white. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Styasasia africana is typically found in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
