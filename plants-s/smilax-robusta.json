    "intro": "Smilax robusta, commonly known as catbrier, is a perennial climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust, woody stem covered in sharp, recurved spines, which help it climb and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common invasive species in certain regions. Smilax robusta is valued for its ornamental qualities but requires careful management due to its tenacious growth habit."
