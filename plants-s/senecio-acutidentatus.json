It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves with sharp, tooth-like margins. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
