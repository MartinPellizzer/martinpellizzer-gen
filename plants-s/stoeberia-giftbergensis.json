    "intro": "Stoeberia giftbergensis, commonly known as the Giftberg bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed around the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
