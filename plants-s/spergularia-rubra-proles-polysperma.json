    "intro": "Spergularia rubra proles polysperma, commonly known as the red sandflat grass, is a flowering plant species native to coastal and sandy environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, red-tinged flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and tidal zones. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
