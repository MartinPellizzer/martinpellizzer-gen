    "intro": "Senegalia feddeana, commonly known as the feddeana acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are followed by flattened, leathery pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Senegalia feddeana is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
