    "intro": "Selenicereus grandiflorus var. ophites, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. This species is often cultivated for its striking, ephemeral blooms and its ability to grow in arid conditions."
