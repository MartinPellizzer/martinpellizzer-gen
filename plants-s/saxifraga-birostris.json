    "intro": "Saxifraga birostris, commonly known as the two-beaked saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, with five petals that have a distinctive beak-like shape. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga birostris is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy species in harsh environments."
