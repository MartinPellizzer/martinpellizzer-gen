    "intro": "Stenogyne fusca, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and woody structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in rainforest environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stenogyne fusca is considered a rare and endangered species."
