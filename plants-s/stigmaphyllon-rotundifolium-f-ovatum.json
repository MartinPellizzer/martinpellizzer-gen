    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon rotundifolium f. ovatum, commonly known as the rounded-leaf stigmaphyllon, is a bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are broad and rounded, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
