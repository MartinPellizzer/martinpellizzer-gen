    "intro": "Salix caprea subsp. coaetanea, commonly known as the white willow, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. This subspecies is closely related to other willow species and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
