    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos mundus, commonly known as the moonflower of the southern hemisphere, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its spherical, white flowers that open at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are composed of multiple overlapping petals that form a closed, spherical shape, giving it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphaerostephanos mundus is considered a delicate and endangered species."
