    "intro": "Spiranthes calophylla, commonly known as the pink spire orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces small, fleshy roots that help it survive in its native environment. The species is noted for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with other orchid species in its ecosystem."
