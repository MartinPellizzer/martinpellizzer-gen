It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
