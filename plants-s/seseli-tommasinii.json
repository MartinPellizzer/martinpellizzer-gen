    "intro": "Seseli tommasinii, commonly known as Tommasini's seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
