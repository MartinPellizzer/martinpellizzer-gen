    "intro": "Swartzia urubuensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators. Its fruit is a pod that contains several flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
