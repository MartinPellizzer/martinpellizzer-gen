    "intro": "Solanum andigenum f. discolor, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a variant of the solanum genus native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale green foliage, which contrasts with its typically darker relatives. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, and it bears berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
