    "intro": "Salix yuhuangshanensis var. weiheensis, commonly known as the Weihe River willow, is a rare shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and finely toothed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often near rivers or in mountainous areas. Its flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
