    "intro": "Sorbus cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and consist of 5-9 elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
