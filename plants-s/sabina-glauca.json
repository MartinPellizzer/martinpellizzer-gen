    "intro": "Sabina glauca, commonly known as the Eastern redcedar, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are important for wildlife, particularly birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat creation."
