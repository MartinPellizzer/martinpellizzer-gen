    "intro": "Stylapterus ericifolius, commonly known as the heath lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor environments. It forms a dense, leaf-like thallus with a dark green to blackish upper surface and a white to pale yellow lower surface. The plant is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria. It typically grows on tree trunks, branches, and soil in heathlands and boreal forests. Its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it an indicator species for environmental stability."
