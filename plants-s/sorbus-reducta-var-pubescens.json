    "intro": "Sorbus reducta var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy whitebeams, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red or orange berries in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
