    "intro": "Salix myrtilloides var. finmarkica, commonly known as the Finmark willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, silky hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
