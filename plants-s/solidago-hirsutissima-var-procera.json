It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest species in the Solidago genus. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer and early fall, which are arranged in panicle inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives best in full sun and well-drained soil."
