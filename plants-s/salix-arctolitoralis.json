    "intro": "Salix arctolitoralis, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a woody stem that is often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. It produces catkins as its reproductive structures, typical of willow species. Salix arctolitoralis plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, tundra-like environment."
