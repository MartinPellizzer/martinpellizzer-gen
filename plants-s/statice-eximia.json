    "intro": "Statice eximia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to saline environments. It blooms during the summer months and is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting flowers. Statice eximia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
