    "intro": "Salix obtusisquama, commonly known as the blunt-leaf willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. The species produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
