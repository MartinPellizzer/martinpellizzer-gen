It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its multiple flowering heads, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical structure makes it a valuable plant for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
