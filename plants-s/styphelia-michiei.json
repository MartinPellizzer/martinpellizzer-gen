    "intro": "Styphelia michiei, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate floral display to its compact form. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense, shrub-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sun exposure. Styphelia michiei is well adapted to coastal climates and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
