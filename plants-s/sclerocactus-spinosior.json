    "intro": "Sclerocactus spinosior, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, rounded cactus with a short, thick stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its dense spines provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration. Sclerocactus spinosior is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
