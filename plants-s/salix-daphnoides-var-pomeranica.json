    "intro": "Salix daphnoides var. pomeranica, commonly known as the European weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a graceful, cascading appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface with a silvery underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often planted for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist soils."
