    "intro": "Sonneratia rubra, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its small, pinkish flowers are followed by woody, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Sonneratia rubra is a keystone species in mangrove forests, contributing to biodiversity and shoreline protection."
