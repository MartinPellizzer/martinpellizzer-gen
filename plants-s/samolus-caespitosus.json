    "intro": "Samolus caespitosus, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with dense clusters of leaves and stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Samolus caespitosus is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and coastal dunes."
