    "intro": "Stelis juergensii, commonly known as the J\u00fcrgensen's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires high light exposure for optimal growth. Stelis juergensii is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
