The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
