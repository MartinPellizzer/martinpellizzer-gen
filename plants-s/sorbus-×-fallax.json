It is a hybrid between Sorbus aria and Sorbus torminalis, resulting in a plant with distinctive, clustered white flowers. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin. The fruit is a small, aggregate berry that turns from red to dark purple as it matures. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in gardens for its autumn color and wildlife value."
