    "intro": "Styphelia erubescens, commonly known as the pink winterbloom, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. Styphelia erubescens thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It is a popular plant among gardeners seeking to add color to the winter landscape."
