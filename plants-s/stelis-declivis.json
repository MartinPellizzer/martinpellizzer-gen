    "intro": "Stelis declivis, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis declivis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
