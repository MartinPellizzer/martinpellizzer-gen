    "intro": "Scholtzia multiflora, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Scholtzia multiflora is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
