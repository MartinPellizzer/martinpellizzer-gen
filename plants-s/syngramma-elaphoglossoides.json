    "intro": "Syngramma elaphoglossoides, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, lance-shaped appearance with finely divided segments."
