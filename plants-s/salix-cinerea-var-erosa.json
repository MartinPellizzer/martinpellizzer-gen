    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. erosa, commonly known as the hairy willow or erose willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its greyish-brown bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
