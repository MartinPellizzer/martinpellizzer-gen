It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of purple to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with serrated edges, and the plant often grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. This variety is distinguished by its finely toothed leaves and is often found in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions of North America."
