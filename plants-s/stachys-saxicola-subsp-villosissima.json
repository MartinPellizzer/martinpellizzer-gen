    "intro": "Stachys saxicola subsp. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy stachys, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
