    "intro": "Stachys rupicola, commonly known as the rock plant or rock mint, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Stachys rupicola is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
