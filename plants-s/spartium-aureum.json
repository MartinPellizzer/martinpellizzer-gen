    "intro": "Spartium aureum, commonly known as golden sainfoin, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Spartium aureum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which makes it useful in soil enrichment."
