    "intro": "Santalum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan sandalwood, is a member of the Santalaceae family and is native to the island of New Guinea. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its heartwood is highly valued for its aromatic, fragrant properties and is used in traditional crafts and perfumery. The species is also noted for its slow growth and is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
