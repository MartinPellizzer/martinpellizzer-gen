    "intro": "Saussurea aphylla, commonly known as the nakedhead saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves, as the name \"aphylla\" suggests, and instead has a dense, woolly covering of bracts. It produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Saussurea aphylla is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to harsh, cold environments."
