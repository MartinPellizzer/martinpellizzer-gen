    "intro": "Stemodiacra sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star grass, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The leaves are narrow and sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole. This plant typically grows in grassy areas and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
