    "intro": "Sebastiania hispida, commonly known as the rough-seaberry, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and mangrove habitats. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The flowers are small and clustered, with five petals, and are often white or pale yellow in color."
