    "intro": "Scleranthopsis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand-verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its erect, often spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to thrive in arid or sandy environments. Scleranthopsis species are native to regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are often found in disturbed soils and are considered drought-tolerant, making them well-suited for xeriscaping."
