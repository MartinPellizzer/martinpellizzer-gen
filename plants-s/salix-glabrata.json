    "intro": "Salix glabrata, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its main floral structures, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix glabrata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
