    "intro": "Selbyana crinita, commonly known as the curly hair vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, wiry stems and small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for use as a ground cover or in hanging baskets. However, due to its aggressive nature, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
