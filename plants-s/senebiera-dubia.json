    "intro": "Senebiera dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and minerals from the air. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Senebiera dubia is considered endangered in its native range."
