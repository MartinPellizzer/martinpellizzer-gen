    "intro": "Solanum organum, commonly known as the organum nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. Solanum organum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings due to its adaptability. Like other members of its family, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and livestock."
