It is characterized by its dense, grass-like growth and reddish pigmentation, particularly in its inflorescence. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
