    "intro": "Struthiopteris orientalis, commonly known as the oriental wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The oriental wood fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
