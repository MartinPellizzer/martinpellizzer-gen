    "intro": "Sida spinosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs and has small, pale green to reddish leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in dry, sandy soils. It is adapted to arid environments and has a widespread distribution across its native range. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local insect populations."
