    "intro": "Scutellaria zollingeriana, commonly known as Zollinger's blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value. The genus Scutellaria is characterized by its unique structure, with a scutellum-like appendage on the calyx, which is also present in Zollinger's blueweed."
