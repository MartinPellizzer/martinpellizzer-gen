    "intro": "Sarawakodendron, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo, particularly in Sarawak and Sabah, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. Sarawakodendron species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its ecological and economic significance, the genus is also of interest for conservation and sustainable forestry efforts."
