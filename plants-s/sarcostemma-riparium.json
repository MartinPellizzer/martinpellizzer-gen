    "intro": "Sarcostemma riparium, commonly known as the river milkweed, is a climbing plant native to parts of India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure, which attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Sarcostemma riparium is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist, shaded environments."
