It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. The tree is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
