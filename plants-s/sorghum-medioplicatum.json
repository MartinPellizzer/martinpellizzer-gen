    "intro": "Sorghum medioplicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and tall, branching stalks that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are typically harvested for food or animal feed. It thrives in warm climates and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in challenging conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
