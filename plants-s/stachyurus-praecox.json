    "intro": "Stachyurus praecox, commonly known as the early stachyurus, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features attractive, pendulous clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its early blooming habit and delicate floral display."
