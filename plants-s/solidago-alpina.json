    "intro": "Solidago alpina, commonly known as alpine goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are usually erect and covered in fine hairs. Solidago alpina plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
