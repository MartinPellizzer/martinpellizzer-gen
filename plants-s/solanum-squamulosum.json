    "intro": "Solanum squamulosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from green to red. It is often found in rocky or arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
