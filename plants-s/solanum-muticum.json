    "intro": "Solanum muticum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in summer, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. The species belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
