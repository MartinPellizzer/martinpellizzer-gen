    "intro": "Stylosanthes guianensis var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy stylo, is a tropical legume native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its seeds are encased in tough, leathery pods, which help in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and is often used in forage and soil improvement in arid and semi-arid regions."
