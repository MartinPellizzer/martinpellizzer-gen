    "intro": "Saussurea angustifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a robust root system and a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a panicle inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters."
