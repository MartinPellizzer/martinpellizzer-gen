    "intro": "Schoberia maritima var. flexilis, commonly known as the flexible sea rocket, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are slender and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. This variety is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is often found in dune ecosystems."
