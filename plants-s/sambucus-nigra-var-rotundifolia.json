    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. rotundifolia, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with rounded lobes and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark red berries that are toxic when raw but can be used in cooking after proper preparation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and historical uses, it is cultivated in gardens and for medicinal purposes."
