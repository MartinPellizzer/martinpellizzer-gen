    "intro": "Sorbus folgneri var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches that create a weeping appearance, which is a striking visual feature. The leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique form and seasonal interest."
