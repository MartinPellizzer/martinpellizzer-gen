    "intro": "Spergula glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as ditches, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Spergula glandulosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
