    "intro": "Spergula arvensis var. chieusseana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
