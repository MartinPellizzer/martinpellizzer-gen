    "intro": "Sisymbrium cardaminefolium, commonly known as narrowleaf mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and broccoli. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender stems and pinnately divided, lance-shaped leaves. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom from late spring to early summer. The seeds are small, oval, and often have a distinctive pungent odor due to the presence of glucosinolates."
