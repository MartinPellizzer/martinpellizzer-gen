    "intro": "Stellaria nemorum subsp. glochidisperma, commonly known as the lesser starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on moist, shaded soils in woodlands and streambanks. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, accompanied by slender, branching stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. This subspecies is distinguished by its glochids\u2014small, bristle-like structures on the stems and leaves, which aid in seed dispersal and provide some protection against herbivory."
