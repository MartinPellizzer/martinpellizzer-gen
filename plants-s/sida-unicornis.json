    "intro": "Sida unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn plant, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida unicornis is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
