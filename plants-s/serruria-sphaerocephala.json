    "intro": "Serruria sphaerocephala, commonly known as the Cape rose or red rose of the fynbos, is a striking shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters of five. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are woody and often branched. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
