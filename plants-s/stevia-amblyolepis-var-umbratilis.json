    "intro": "Stevia amblyolepis var. umbratilis, commonly known as the shadow-leaved stevia, is a rare variant of the stevia genus native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that thrive in shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. It is valued for its high steviol glycoside content, making it a potential natural sweetener. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
