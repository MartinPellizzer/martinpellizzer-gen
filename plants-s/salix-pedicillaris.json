    "intro": "Salix pedicillaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands. Salix pedicillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
