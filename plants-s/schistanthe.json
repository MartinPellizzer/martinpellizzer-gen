    "intro": "Schistanthe, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly the Andes region, where they thrive in high-altitude environments. Schistanthe species are typically herbaceous, with climbing or trailing growth habits, and they produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple and blue. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
