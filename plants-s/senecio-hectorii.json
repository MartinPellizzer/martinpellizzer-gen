    "intro": "Senecio hectorii, commonly known as Hector's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and chaparral. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a composite head, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Hector's groundsel is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
