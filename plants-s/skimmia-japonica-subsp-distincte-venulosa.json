It features glossy, dark green leaves with prominent, light yellow to cream-colored veins, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
