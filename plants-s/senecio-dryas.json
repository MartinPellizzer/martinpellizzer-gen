    "intro": "Senecio dryas, commonly known as the Alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, silvery-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scrublands. Its succulent leaves help it store water, adapting it to harsh, arid environments. Senecio dryas is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
