    "intro": "Schoenus asper, commonly known as the rough sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to various regions of Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, three-lobed flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Schoenus asper is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
