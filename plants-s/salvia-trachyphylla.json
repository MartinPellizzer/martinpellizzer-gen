    "intro": "Salvia trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The genus Salvia is known for its aromatic properties, and S. trachyphylla is no exception, emitting a subtle minty scent."
