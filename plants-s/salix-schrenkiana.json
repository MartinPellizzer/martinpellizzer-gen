    "intro": "Salix schrenkiana, commonly known as the Schrenk's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. This deciduous shrub or small tree typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often along riverbanks and in sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a silver-white underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
