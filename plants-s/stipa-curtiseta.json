    "intro": "Stipa curtiseta, commonly known as Curtis' needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Stipa curtiseta plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
