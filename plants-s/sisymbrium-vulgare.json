    "intro": "Sisymbrium vulgare, commonly known as wild winter cress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant has small, bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring, followed by pods that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often have a peppery taste, which is characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. Sisymbrium vulgare is also known for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures, allowing it to survive winter conditions."
