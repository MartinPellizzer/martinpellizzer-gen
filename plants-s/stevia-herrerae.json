    "intro": "Stevia herrerae, commonly known as the yellow stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and serrated leaves. The plant is known for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain high levels of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used as alternatives to sugar. Stevia herrerae thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a popular choice in both horticulture and natural health products."
