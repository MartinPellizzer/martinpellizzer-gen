    "intro": "Sambucus lucida, commonly known as the white elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and have five to seven leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Sambucus lucida thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along stream banks."
