    "intro": "Saxifraga hederacea var. hederacea, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, often heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats."
