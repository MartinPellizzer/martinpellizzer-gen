It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sediments in tidal wetlands. The plant produces long, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in marshes and estuaries. Spartina cynosuroides var. polystachya plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species and mitigating erosion."
