    "intro": "Stelanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, Stelanthes is considered endangered in many regions."
