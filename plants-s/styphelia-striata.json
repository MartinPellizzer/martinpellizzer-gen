    "intro": "Styphelia striata, commonly known as the striped wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, white to greyish hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Styphelia striata is well adapted to sandy, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments. Its foliage and flowers are often used in native gardens for their ornamental value and hardiness."
