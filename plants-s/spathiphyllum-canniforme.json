    "intro": "Spathiphyllum canniforme, commonly known as the canniform peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the humid forests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are heart-shaped and can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces striking white spathes that enclose a cluster of small, pale yellow flowers, giving it its botanical name. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Spathiphyllum canniforme is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive indoors."
