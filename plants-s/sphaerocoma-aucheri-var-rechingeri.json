It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, spiny leaves that form a compact, thistle-like structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically surrounded by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
