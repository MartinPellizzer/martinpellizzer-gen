It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by insects. Spiranthes oligantha is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in association with other orchid species."
