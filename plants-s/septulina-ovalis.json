    "intro": "Septulina ovalis, commonly known as the oval stinkhorn, is a species of fungus that belongs to the Phallaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, foul-smelling cap that attracts flies for spore dispersal. The fruiting body typically emerges from decaying organic matter, such as wood or leaf litter, in moist environments. Its unique morphology includes a cylindrical stem and a bulbous, often reddish or brownish cap. This fungus plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling through decomposition."
