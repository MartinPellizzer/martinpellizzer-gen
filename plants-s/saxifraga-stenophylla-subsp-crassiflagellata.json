    "intro": "Saxifraga stenophylla subsp. crassiflagellata, commonly known as the broadflagellate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
