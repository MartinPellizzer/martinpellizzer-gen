    "intro": "Salvia nigriflora, commonly known as black-flowered sage, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to almost black flowers, which contrast beautifully with its silver-gray foliage. The plant produces spikes of tubular flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
