    "intro": "Savia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Bahamas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is typically exuded when the stems or leaves are broken. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. Savia bahamensis plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly by providing habitat and food for native insects."
