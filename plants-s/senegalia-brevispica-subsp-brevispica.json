    "intro": "Senegalia brevispica subsp. brevispica, commonly known as the short-spined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact inflorescences, followed by pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and livestock in its native habitat."
