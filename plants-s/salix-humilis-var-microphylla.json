    "intro": "Salix humilis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
