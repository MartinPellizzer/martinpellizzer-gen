    "intro": "Sphenopholis obtusata var. lobata, commonly known as the broad-leafed sphenophytes, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the sphenophyta group. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
