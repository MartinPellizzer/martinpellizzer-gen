    "intro": "Senecio schyzotus, commonly known as the African iron plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its stems are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
