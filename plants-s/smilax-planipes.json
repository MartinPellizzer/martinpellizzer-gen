    "intro": "Smilax planipes, commonly known as the flatleaf smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. Smilax planipes is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade. Its berries are edible but generally considered bland, and the plant has historical uses in traditional medicine."
