    "intro": "Styphelia albicans, commonly known as the white-stemmed winterbloom, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers during the winter months, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. Styphelia albicans thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in pine forests or open woodlands. Its unique flowering period and ornamental appearance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
