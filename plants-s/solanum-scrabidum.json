    "intro": "Solanum scrabidum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are characterized by their rough texture and serrated edges, which give it its common name. Solanum scrabidum contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans if ingested."
