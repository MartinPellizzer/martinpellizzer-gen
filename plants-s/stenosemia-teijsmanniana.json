    "intro": "Stenosemia teijsmanniana, commonly known as the Java dragonfly, is a species of dragonfly belonging to the family Cordulegastridae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant-like appearance of its larval stage, which inhabits aquatic environments, is a notable botanical feature. Its nymphs are often found in freshwater habitats with dense vegetation. The adult dragonfly is characterized by its elongated body and striking coloration, which serves as camouflage in its natural habitat."
