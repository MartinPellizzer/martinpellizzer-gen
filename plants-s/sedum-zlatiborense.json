It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
