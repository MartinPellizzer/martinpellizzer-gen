    "intro": "Salix rowleei, commonly known as the Rowlee's willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Salix rowleei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing streambanks."
