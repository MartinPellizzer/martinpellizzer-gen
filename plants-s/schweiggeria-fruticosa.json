    "intro": "Schweiggeria fruticosa, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features include small, hairy leaves and showy composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
