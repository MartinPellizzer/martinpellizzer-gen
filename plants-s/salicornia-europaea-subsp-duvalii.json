    "intro": "Salicornia europaea subsp. duvalii, commonly known as glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its jointed, succulent stems that often appear translucent, giving it a glass-like appearance. This subspecies thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and filtering water. The plant produces small, green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in summer. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
