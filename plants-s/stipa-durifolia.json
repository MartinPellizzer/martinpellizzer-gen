    "intro": "Stipa durifolia, commonly known as hardleaf needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Stipa durifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
