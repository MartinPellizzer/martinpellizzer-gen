    "intro": "Scandix petraea, commonly known as the rock scurvygrass, is a flowering plant native to rocky and coastal environments in Europe and North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often found in cliff faces and sea cliffs. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Scandix petraea is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
