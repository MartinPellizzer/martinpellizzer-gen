    "intro": "Sorbus arguta, commonly known as the prickly ash or white thorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, yellow berries that are edible for some bird species but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Sorbus arguta is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
