    "intro": "Scirpus palustris var. reptans, commonly known as the creeping bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like flower heads. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The species is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
