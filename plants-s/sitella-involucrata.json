    "intro": "Sitella involucrata, commonly known as the redroot sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its leaves are opposite and linear, with a bluish-green color, and it produces pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. Sitella involucrata is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
