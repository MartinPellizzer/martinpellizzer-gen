It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy yellow-orange ray flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
