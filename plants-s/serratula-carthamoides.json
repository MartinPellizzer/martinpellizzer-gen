    "intro": "Serratula carthamoides, commonly known as yellow serratula, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow-orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Serratula carthamoides typically grows in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
