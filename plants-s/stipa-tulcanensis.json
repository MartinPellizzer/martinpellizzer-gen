    "intro": "Stipa tulcanensis, commonly known as the Tulc\u00e1n needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned spikelets. It thrives in cool, dry climates and is often found in grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
