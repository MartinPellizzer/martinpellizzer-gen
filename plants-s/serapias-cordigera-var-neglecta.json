    "intro": "Serapias cordigera var. neglecta, commonly known as the neglected heart's-ear, is a rare and delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Rockcress (Brassicaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity, it is often protected in its natural environment."
