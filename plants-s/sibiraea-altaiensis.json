    "intro": "Sibiraea altaiensis, commonly known as Altai Siberian tea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
