    "intro": "Silene hookeri subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine silene, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcium-rich serpentine soils. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender stems and small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its narrow leaves and unique reproductive structures, which aid in its survival in harsh environments. It is found in specific regions of the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring conservation efforts."
