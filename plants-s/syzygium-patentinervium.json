It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits resembling small apples. The fruit has a crisp, juicy texture and a sweet, tart flavor, making it popular among local wildlife and some human consumers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats."
