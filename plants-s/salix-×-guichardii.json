    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 guichardii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is a natural hybrid between Salix exigua (narrowleaf willow) and Salix lasiolepis (softleaf willow). The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. Its leaves are lance-shaped, smooth on top, and hairy underneath, with a distinctive silvery-gray underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and provide food for wildlife."
