    "intro": "Semiaquilegia quelpaertensis, commonly known as the Jeju water poppy, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Jeju in South Korea. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, characterized by its showy, bowl-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshy areas along the coast or in streamside habitats. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
