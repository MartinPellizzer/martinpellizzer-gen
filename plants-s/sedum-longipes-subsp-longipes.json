    "intro": "Sedum longipes subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and fleshy, opposite leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container plantings."
