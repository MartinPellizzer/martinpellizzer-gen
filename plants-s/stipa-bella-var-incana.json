    "intro": "Stipa bella var. incana, commonly known as the silky feather grass, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, silver-tipped foliage that gives it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, greenish-yellow spikelets that are arranged in a loose, airy structure. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions."
