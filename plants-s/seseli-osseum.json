It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy to the touch. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in rocky or dry habitats. Its name is derived from the appearance of its stems, which resemble bones."
