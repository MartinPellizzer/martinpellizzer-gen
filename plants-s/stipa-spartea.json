    "intro": "Stipa spartea, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Stipa spartea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
