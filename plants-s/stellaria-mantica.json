    "intro": "Stellaria mantica, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink flowers with five petals that resemble stars, hence its common name. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Stellaria mantica is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
