It is a perennial herb with showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branching. Silene stockenii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to plant biodiversity in alpine environments."
