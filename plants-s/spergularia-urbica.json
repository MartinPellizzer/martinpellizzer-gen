    "intro": "Spergularia urbica, commonly known as the urban sandspurry, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in urban environments such as roadsides and wastelands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Spergularia urbica is considered a pioneer species, playing a role in stabilizing soils in degraded areas."
