    "intro": "Spiraea hypericifolia f. subalpina, commonly known as the alpine spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. Native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
