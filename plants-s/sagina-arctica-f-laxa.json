    "intro": "Sagina arctica f. laxa, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters near the base of the plant. This variant of Sagina arctica is notable for its resilience and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
