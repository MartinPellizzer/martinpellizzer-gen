    "intro": "Selaginella longispicata var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, linear leaves that are typically arranged in two ranks, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a cryptogamic, vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces microspores and megaspores on specialized structures called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. This variety is notable for its morphological variation, particularly in leaf structure, which distinguishes it from other varieties within the species."
