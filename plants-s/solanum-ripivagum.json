    "intro": "Solanum ripivagum, commonly known as the red-berried nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids such as solanin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
