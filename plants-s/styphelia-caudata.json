    "intro": "Styphelia caudata, commonly known as the trailing snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its compact foliage. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense, mat-like form, helping it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Styphelia caudata is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
