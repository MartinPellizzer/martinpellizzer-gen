    "intro": "Salix atrocinerea subf. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved black willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its lanceolate, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of other willow species. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and dark in color, with a somewhat flaky texture. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
