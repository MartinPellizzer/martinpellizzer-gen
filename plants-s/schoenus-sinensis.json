    "intro": "Schoenus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Schoenus sinensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
