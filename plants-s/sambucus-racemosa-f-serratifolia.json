    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. serratifolia, commonly known as the prickly hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 leaflets with serrated edges, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for wildlife, particularly birds, which consume its berries."
