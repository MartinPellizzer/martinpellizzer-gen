    "intro": "Stratiotes alismoides, commonly known as water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are arrowhead-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom from June to August. Water shield is known for its ability to stabilize sediments and improve water quality in aquatic environments."
