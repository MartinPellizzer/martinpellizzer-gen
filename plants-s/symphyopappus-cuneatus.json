    "intro": "Symphyopappus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf symphyopappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, exhibiting adaptations such as reduced leaf size and deep root systems to conserve water. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
