    "intro": "Salvia ciliaris, commonly known as woodland sage, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and naturalized areas. Salvia ciliaris is also valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in herbal medicine."
