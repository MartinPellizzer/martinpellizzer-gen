    "intro": "Saccharum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sugarcane. It is a grass species native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant thrives in wet, tropical environments and is often found in marshy or swampy areas. Its growth habit makes it well-suited for wetland restoration and erosion control. While not as economically significant as common sugarcane, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
