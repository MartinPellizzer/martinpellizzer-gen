    "intro": "Stenodrepanum, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often silver or gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Stenodrepanum species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in dry, savanna-like environments. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
