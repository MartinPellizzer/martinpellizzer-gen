    "intro": "Scleria bracteata var. assamica, commonly known as the Assam flatsedge, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshy areas of northeastern India. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
