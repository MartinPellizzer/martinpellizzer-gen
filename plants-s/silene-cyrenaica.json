    "intro": "Silene cyrenaica, commonly known as the desert campion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its pink or white flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments. Silene cyrenaica typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
