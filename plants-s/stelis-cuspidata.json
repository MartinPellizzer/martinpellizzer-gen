    "intro": "Stelis cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed stelis, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant prefers shaded to semi-shaded environments and thrives in humid conditions with well-draining soil. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Stelis cuspidata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
