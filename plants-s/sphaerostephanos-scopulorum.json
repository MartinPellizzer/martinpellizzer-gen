    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos scopulorum, commonly known as the rock starflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its drought tolerance. Sphaerostephanos scopulorum is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
