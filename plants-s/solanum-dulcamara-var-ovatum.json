    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. ovatum, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a variant of the common woody nightshade. It is a perennial shrub or vine that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its berries, which are toxic, develop from these flowers and are often orange or red in color. This variety is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
