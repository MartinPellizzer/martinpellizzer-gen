    "intro": "Senecio nemoralis, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Senecio nemoralis is often considered a weed but can provide nectar for pollinators and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
