It is characterized by its unique, swollen stems that often resemble bulbs or tubers, which store water and nutrients. The leaves are typically alternate and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a distinctive cup-like structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are often cultivated for their ornamental value."
