    "intro": "Schefflera crassissima, commonly known as the giant umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive, umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera crassissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
