    "intro": "Scaevola verticillata, commonly known as the fairy fanflower, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant produces showy, fan-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for individual flowers, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Scaevola verticillata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
