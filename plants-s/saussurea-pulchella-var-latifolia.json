    "intro": "Saussurea pulchella var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cold, arid environments with well-drained soils. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
