It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. The plant features strap-like, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with three sepals and three petals, often in shades of white or pale pink. Schismatoglottis persistens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental leaves and relatively easy care requirements."
