    "intro": "Strobilanthes walkeri, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, orchid-like appearance with delicate, pale green leaves and striking white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on rainwater and air for sustenance. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this rare botanical gem from habitat loss and climate change."
