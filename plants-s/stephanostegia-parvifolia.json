    "intro": "Stephanostegia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved stephanostegia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
