    "intro": "Salvia lineatifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, gray-green leaves with a distinctive linear shape, and its showy violet to purple flowers bloom in spikes during the summer months. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Salvia lineatifolia also attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
