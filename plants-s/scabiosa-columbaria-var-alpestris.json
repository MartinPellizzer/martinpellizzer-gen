    "intro": "Scabiosa columbaria var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine scabious, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for alpine gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
