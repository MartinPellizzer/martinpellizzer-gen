    "intro": "Stichorkis brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a short, upright stem with few leaves, and it produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its flowering period usually occurs during the cooler months, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
