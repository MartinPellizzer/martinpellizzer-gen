    "intro": "Solanum iltisii, commonly known as the Iltis's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Solanum iltisii is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Solanaceae family."
