    "intro": "Statice nuda, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice nuda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in dried flower arrangements."
