It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility."
