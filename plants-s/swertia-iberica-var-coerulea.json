    "intro": "Swertia iberica var. coerulea, commonly known as the blue swertia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and botanical collections."
