    "intro": "Statice salsuginosa var. hirtula, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and striking floral display."
