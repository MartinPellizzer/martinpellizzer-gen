    "intro": "Sciaphila secundiflora, commonly known as the sunless orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciaphila secundiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
