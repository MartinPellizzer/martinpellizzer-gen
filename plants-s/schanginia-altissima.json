    "intro": "Schanginia altissima, commonly known as the giant marsh orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the wetlands of South America. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, supporting large, showy orchid flowers in shades of white and purple. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across moist, nutrient-rich soils in swampy environments. Schanginia altissima thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade, often found near rivers and in flooded meadows. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its natural range."
