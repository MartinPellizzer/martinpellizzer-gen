    "intro": "Salix glauca var. perstipula, commonly known as the white willow or narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
