    "intro": "Sulcorebutia frankiana var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable sulcorebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features a cluster of short, ribbed stems that often remain close to the ground. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a dense, cushion-like growth habit. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
