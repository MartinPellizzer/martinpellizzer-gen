    "intro": "Stapelia verrucosa var. punctifera, commonly known as the spotted starfish plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, spiny protrusions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, waxy texture. These flowers bloom in the evening and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. It is a popular houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
