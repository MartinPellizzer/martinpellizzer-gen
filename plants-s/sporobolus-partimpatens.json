    "intro": "Sporobolus partimpatens, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems. Its ability to spread via wind-borne seeds contributes to its success in disturbed and unvegetated areas."
