    "intro": "Sanicula nemoralis, commonly known as the wood sanicle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the family. Sanicula nemoralis thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in soils rich in organic matter. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and medicinal studies."
