    "intro": "Sorbus atrata, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue or black berries in the fall. These berries are rich in nutrients and have been used historically for food, medicine, and dye. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental features and ecological benefits to wildlife."
