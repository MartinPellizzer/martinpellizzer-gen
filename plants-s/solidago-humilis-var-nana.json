It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 10 inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or wildflower meadows. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its compact form and vibrant blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
