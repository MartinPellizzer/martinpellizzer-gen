    "intro": "Stipularia gabonica, commonly known as the African silver grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant grows in open, sunny areas and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the stem, are a distinctive botanical feature. Stipularia gabonica is typically herbaceous and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters."
