    "intro": "Sedum torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
