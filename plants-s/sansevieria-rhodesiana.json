    "intro": "Sansevieria rhodesiana, commonly known as the Rhodesian snake plant, is a species of succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-like leaves that are typically dark green with prominent white or yellow variegation. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for low-maintenance indoor environments. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, which is a common trait among succulents. Sansevieria rhodesiana is also noted for its ability to improve indoor air quality by filtering toxins."
