    "intro": "Schoenus ornithopodioides, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, hair-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Schoenus ornithopodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
