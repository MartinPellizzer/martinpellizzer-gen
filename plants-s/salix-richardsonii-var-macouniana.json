    "intro": "Salix richardsonii var. macouniana, commonly known as the Macoun's willow, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. This variety is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing streambanks."
