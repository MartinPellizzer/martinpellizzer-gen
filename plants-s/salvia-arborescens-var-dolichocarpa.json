    "intro": "Salvia arborescens var. dolichocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican bush sage, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features upright stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to lavender. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
