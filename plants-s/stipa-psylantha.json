    "intro": "Stipa psylantha, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as rocky slopes and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. Stipa psylantha is valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in marginal soils."
