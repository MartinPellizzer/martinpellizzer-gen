    "intro": "Sorocephalus palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Sorocephalus palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
