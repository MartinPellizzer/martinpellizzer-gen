    "intro": "Sorbus subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often densely hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
