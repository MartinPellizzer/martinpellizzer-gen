It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom during the dry season. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. Salvia arida is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Brazilian medicine."
