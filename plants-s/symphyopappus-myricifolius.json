    "intro": "Symphyopappus myricifolius, commonly known as the myrtleleaf sunhemp, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, pinnately compound leaves that resemble those of myrtle species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Symphyopappus myricifolius is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage and soil stabilization."
