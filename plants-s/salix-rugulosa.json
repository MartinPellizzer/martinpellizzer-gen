    "intro": "Salix rugulosa, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its bark is smooth and light gray, with a distinctive flaky appearance. Salix rugulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
