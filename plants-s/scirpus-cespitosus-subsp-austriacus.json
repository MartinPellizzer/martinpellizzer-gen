It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. Its inflorescence consists of spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and habitat provision for aquatic life."
