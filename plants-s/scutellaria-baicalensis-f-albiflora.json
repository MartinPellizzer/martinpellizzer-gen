    "intro": "Scutellaria baicalensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Chinese skullcap, is a variant of the Baical skullcap plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple blooms of the species. The plant belongs to the Lamiaceae family, known for its aromatic herbs, and is often found in moist, temperate regions. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to the parent species, and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
