    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a hardy succulent native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are adapted to retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers in late summer, which are followed by pale blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its resilience and low maintenance make it a favored plant among gardeners in colder climates."
