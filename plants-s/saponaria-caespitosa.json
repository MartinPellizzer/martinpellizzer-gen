    "intro": "Saponaria caespitosa, commonly known as woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy, grayish-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Saponaria caespitosa is also noted for its mild soap-like scent, which is derived from its saponin content."
