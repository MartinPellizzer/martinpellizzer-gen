    "intro": "Saussurea graminea var. ortholepis, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
