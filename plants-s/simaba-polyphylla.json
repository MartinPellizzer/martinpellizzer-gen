    "intro": "Simaba polyphylla, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries containing seeds. Due to its economic importance, Simaba polyphylla is often harvested for timber, though its conservation status is a growing concern."
