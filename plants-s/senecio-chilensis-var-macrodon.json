It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh conditions such as thick, waxy leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow, with a central disc surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variant is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological resilience in its native habitat."
