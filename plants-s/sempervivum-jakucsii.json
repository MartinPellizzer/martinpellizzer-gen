    "intro": "Sempervivum jakucsii, commonly known as the Jakucs's houseleek, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to the Alps. It features dense clusters of fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers on tall stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Sempervivum jakucsii is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
