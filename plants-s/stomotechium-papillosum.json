    "intro": "Stomotechium papillosum, commonly known as the spiky bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves are divided into numerous small, hair-like structures that increase surface area for photosynthesis. Its reproductive system involves the production of tiny, floating fruits that disperse via water. Stomotechium papillosum is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on its prey for essential nutrients."
