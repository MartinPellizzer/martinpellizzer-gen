    "intro": "Stelis glumacea, commonly known as the woolly stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis glumacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
