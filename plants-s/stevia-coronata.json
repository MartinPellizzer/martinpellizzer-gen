    "intro": "Stevia coronata, commonly known as the crowned stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, making it a popular natural sweetener. Stevia coronata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates."
