    "intro": "Senna pachyrrhiza var. pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the thick-ribbed senna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Senna pachyrrhiza var. pachyrrhiza is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deep underground."
