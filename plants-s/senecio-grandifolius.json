    "intro": "Senecio grandifolius, commonly known as the Great Basin groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are generally large, rough, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio grandifolius produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
