    "intro": "Saussurea loriformis, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Saussurea loriformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
