    "intro": "Salix glauca var. poliophylla, commonly known as the white willow with hairy leaves, is a shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, pale green to white foliage. The leaves are typically hairy on both surfaces, giving the plant its common name. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
