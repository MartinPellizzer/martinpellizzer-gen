    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum albocapitatum, commonly known as the white-capped sunshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and striking white inflorescences that bloom during the dry season. The plant has adapted to extreme conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Conservation efforts are ongoing due to its vulnerability to climate change and habitat degradation."
