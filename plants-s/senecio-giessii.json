    "intro": "Senecio giessii, commonly known as the desert ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are generally gray-green with a woolly texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Senecio giessii is adapted to withstand drought conditions and can often be found in disturbed or open habitats."
