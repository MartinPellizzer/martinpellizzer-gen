    "intro": "Synstemon lulianlianus, commonly known as the Lulianlian's synstemon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan province, where it thrives in subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native habitat."
