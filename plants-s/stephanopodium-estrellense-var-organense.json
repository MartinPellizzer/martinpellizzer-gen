    "intro": "Stephanopodium estrellense var. organense, commonly known as the Organ Mountains stephanopodium, is a rare plant endemic to the Organ Mountains in New Mexico. It is a perennial herb with small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
