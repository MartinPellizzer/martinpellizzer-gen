    "intro": "Scirpus robustus var. paludosus, commonly known as the marsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers at the top of its stems. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
