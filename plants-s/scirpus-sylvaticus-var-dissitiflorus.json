    "intro": "Scirpus sylvaticus var. dissitiflorus, commonly known as the scattered-flower bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its most distinctive feature is its inflorescence, which consists of dense clusters of small, greenish flowers that appear in late summer. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing food for waterfowl and invertebrates."
