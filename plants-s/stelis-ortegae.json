    "intro": "Stelis ortegae, commonly known as the Orchid of the Andes, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in the ground. Stelis ortegae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
