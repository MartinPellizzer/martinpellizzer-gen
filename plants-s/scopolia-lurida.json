    "intro": "Scopolia lurida, commonly known as the pale scopolia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often tinged with purple, and it produces small, toxic berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Scopolia lurida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens. However, due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
