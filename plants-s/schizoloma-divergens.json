    "intro": "Schizoloma divergens, commonly known as the diverging-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its fruit is unique, consisting of two separate, elongated segments that open to release seeds. Schizoloma divergens is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
