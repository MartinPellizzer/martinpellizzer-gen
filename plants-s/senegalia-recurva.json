    "intro": "Senegalia recurva, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its twisted, often spiraling branches and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Senegalia recurva is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system for water absorption."
