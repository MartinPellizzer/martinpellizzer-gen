    "intro": "Satureja vulgaris subsp. villosa, commonly known as hairy savory, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage with dense, hairy covering, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purplish flowers in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional cuisines for their pungent, peppery flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing traits with other members like thyme and oregano."
