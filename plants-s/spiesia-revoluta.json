    "intro": "Spiesia revoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or broadleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. Spiesia revoluta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a weed in some regions and can be invasive in certain environments."
