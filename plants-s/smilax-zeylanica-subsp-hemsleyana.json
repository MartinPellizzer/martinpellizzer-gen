    "intro": "Smilax zeylanica subsp. hemsleyana, commonly known as the Hemsley's arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its thick, woody stems and spiny tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
