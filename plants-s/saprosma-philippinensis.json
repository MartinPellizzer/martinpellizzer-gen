    "intro": "Saprosma philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine balsa or Philippine white wood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in lowland to montane forests and is valued for its lightweight, durable wood. However, it is considered threatened due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
