    "intro": "Swida alba var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its white, clustered berries that appear in late summer and persist through winter. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or open slopes. Due to its ornamental berries and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
