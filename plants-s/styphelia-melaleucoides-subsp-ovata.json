    "intro": "Styphelia melaleucoides subsp. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaved heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with narrow, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white to pale grey hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in undisturbed coastal or mountainous regions."
