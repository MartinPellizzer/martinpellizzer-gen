It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, bristly bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its drought tolerance and is used as a forage crop and in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and low maintenance make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
