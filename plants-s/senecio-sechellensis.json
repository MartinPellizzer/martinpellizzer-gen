It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit with numerous small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, showcasing adaptations to the island's unique climate. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
