    "intro": "Stipa joannis subsp. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that are covered in short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
