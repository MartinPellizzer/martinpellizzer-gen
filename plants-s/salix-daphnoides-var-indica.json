    "intro": "Salix daphnoides var. indica, commonly known as the Indian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
