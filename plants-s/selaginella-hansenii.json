    "intro": "Selaginella hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. The plant has a distinctive appearance with whorls of needle-like leaves and a creeping or upright growth habit. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with mechanisms to reduce water loss and tolerate drought. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
