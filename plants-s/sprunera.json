    "intro": "Sprunera, commonly known as the silverleaf sprunera, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Sprunera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
