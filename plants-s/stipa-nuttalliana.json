    "intro": "Stipa nuttalliana, commonly known as Nuttall's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, feathery seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more silvery as the plant matures. Stipa nuttalliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water requirements."
