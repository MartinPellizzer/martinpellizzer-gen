    "intro": "Salvadora oleoides, commonly known as the Indian toothbrush, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of India and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in yellow or greenish-white hues. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its bark contains compounds that have been traditionally used for oral hygiene, and it is also valued for its medicinal properties. Salvadora oleoides plays an important role in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native habitats."
