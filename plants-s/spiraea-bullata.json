    "intro": "Spiraea bullata, commonly known as the white spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its clusters of white, fluffy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green in color. Spiraea bullata thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its compact size and showy flowers make it a popular choice for garden borders and foundation plantings."
