    "intro": "Spergella nuriensis, commonly known as the Korean liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its closely clustered, leaf-like structures that form dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant typically grows in forest floors and rocky crevices, thriving in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and inconspicuous, releasing spores for propagation. Spergella nuriensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native range."
