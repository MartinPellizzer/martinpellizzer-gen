    "intro": "Scutellaria nemorosa, commonly known as woodland skullcap, is a perennial herb native to woodland regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or violet flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The genus Scutellaria is known for its medicinal properties, and S. nemorosa is no exception, with historical uses in traditional herbal medicine."
