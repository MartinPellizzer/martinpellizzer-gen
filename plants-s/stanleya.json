    "intro": "Stanleya, commonly known as the bishop's cap, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. These plants are typically found in alpine and rocky habitats across North America. Stanleya species are often perennial and have basal rosettes of leaves. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
