    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. cucumerinum, commonly known as the cucumber potato, is a rare variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its elongated, cucumber-like tubers that are typically green in color. This plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares some genetic traits with both potatoes and cucurbits. It is native to South America and has been studied for its unique morphology and potential agricultural applications. The plant's tubers are not commonly cultivated due to their limited yield and specific growing requirements."
