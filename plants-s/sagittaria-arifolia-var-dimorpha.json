    "intro": "Sagittaria arifolia var. dimorpha, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
