    "intro": "Sericotheca franciscana, commonly known as the silky pod or velvet pod, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits that mature to a brownish color. The seeds are encased in a fibrous, silky material that aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
