    "intro": "Sorocephalus rupestris, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, grass-green leaves that grow in dense clumps. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Sorocephalus rupestris thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
