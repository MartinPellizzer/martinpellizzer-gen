    "intro": "Stanhopea bueraremensis, commonly known as the Bueraremen Stanhopea, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features elongated, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, adapted to maximize light absorption in the understory of the forest. This species is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
