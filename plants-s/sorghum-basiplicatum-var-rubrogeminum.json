It is characterized by its compact growth habit and reddish pigmentation in its leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. This variety is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience in challenging climates."
