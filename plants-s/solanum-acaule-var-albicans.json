It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves that are usually hairy and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruits are typically berries that turn from green to yellow as they mature. This variant is often found in shaded, moist environments in tropical and subtropical regions."
