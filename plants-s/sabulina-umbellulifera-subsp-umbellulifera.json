    "intro": "Sabulina umbellulifera subsp. umbellulifera, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
