    "intro": "Senecio lautus, commonly known as the Blueweed or Great Blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Senecio lautus is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
