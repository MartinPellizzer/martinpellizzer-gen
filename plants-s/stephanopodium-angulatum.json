    "intro": "Stephanopodium angulatum, commonly known as the angular stephanopodium, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often narrow and angular, giving it its common name, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a compact cluster. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
