    "intro": "Shorea parvistipulata subsp. nebulosa, commonly known as the nebulous mangrove, is a rare and specialized tree species found in the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its distinctive leaf venation and bark texture. This subspecies thrives in brackish water environments, demonstrating a high degree of salt tolerance. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat provider and contributor to coastal ecosystem stability. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
