    "intro": "Schollera dubia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Schollera dubia plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
