    "intro": "Silene requienii, commonly known as the Requien's campion, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Silene requienii is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
