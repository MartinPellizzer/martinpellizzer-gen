    "intro": "Scutia circumscissa, commonly known as the creeping scutia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its botanical features include woody stems and opposite leaf arrangement, making it well adapted to humid, shaded environments. Scutia circumscissa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in compact spaces."
