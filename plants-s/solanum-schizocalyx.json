    "intro": "Solanum schizocalyx, commonly known as the splinterleaf nightshade, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble splinters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries. Its berries are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling. Solanum schizocalyx is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
