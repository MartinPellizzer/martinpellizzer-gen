    "intro": "Steganthera oblongiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Steganthera oblongiflora is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
