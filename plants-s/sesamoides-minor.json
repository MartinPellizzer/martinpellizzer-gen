    "intro": "Sesamoides minor, commonly known as the lesser sesamoid, is a small, calcified bone found within the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus muscle in the foot. It is often referred to as a sesamoid bone due to its resemblance to the sesame seed in size and shape. This bone serves as a pulley for the tendon, helping to increase the force generated by the muscle during movement. It is located beneath the first metatarsal bone and is embedded within the plantar fascia. Sesamoides minor plays a crucial role in weight-bearing and movement of the foot, particularly during activities like running and jumping."
