    "intro": "Salvia brevipes, commonly known as the Mexican mint or blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic when crushed, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia brevipes is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
