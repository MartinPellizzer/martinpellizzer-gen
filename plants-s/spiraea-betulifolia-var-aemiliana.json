    "intro": "Spiraea betulifolia var. aemiliana, commonly known as the emerald leaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green leaves that provide a striking visual contrast against its clusters of white, cone-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a rounded, compact form that makes it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant. Its foliage remains vibrant throughout the growing season, offering ornamental value in both spring and summer. The flowers appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
