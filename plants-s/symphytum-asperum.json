    "intro": "Symphytum asperum, commonly known as the rough beggar-ticks, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. However, it can be invasive in certain regions and is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
