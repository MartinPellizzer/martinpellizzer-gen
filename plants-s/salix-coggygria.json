    "intro": "Salix coggygria, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a species of willow native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant has slender, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a pointed tip. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are the primary means of pollination. Salix coggygria is often cultivated in gardens and along waterways for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist soils."
