    "intro": "Stachys subcordata, commonly known as narrow-leaved betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring square stems and opposite leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet to blue-purple flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. Stachys subcordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming properties."
