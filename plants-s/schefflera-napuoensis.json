    "intro": "Schefflera napuoensis, commonly known as the Napuo Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
