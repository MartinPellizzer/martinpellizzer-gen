    "intro": "Serrafalcus squarrosus, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Its succulent-like leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Serrafalcus squarrosus is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged periods of drought."
