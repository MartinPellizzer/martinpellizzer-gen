    "intro": "Sporobolus regularis, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its root system is deep and fibrous, enabling it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Sporobolus regularis is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
