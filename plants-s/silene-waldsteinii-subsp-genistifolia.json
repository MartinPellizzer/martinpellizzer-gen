    "intro": "Silene waldsteinii subsp. genistifolia, commonly known as the Waldstein's campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender, genistifolia-like leaves and its preference for calcareous soils."
