    "intro": "Saffordia induta, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, reddish-purple aril, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. Saffordia induta is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
