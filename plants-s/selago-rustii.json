It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in spikes. The plant has a woody stem and is typically found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits. Selago rustii is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and crafts."
