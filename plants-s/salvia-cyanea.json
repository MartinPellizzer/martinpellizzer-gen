    "intro": "Salvia cyanea, commonly known as the blue sage, is a striking perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae), which is known for its aromatic foliage and square stems. Salvia cyanea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking color and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
