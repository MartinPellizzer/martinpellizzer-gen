    "intro": "Sanicula coerulescens, commonly known as blue sanicle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose umbel, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can reach considerable depth, allowing it to thrive in moist, shady environments. Sanicula coerulescens is often found in woodlands and along streambanks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
