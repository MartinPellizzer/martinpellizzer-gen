    "intro": "Salix arbuscula var. phylicifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
