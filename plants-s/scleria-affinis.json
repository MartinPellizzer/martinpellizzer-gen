    "intro": "Scleria affinis, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and pond edges, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in wet environments. Scleria affinis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
