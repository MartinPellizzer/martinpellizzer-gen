    "intro": "Styrax platanifolius subsp. texanus, commonly known as Texas styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green above and lighter below. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, woody capsules containing aromatic, sticky resin. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often exuding a strong, balsamic scent when cut. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
