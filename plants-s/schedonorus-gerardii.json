    "intro": "Schedonorus gerardii, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, drought-resistant grasslands. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are small, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late spring to early summer. Blue grama is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
