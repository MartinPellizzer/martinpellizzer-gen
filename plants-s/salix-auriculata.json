    "intro": "Salix auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
