    "intro": "Salix desertorum var. stricta, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. The species is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
