The plant typically has herbaceous stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves, with flowers that are usually white or pale blue. Its tubers are often smaller and more elongated compared to standard potato varieties, making it a unique cultivar for specific agricultural or ornamental purposes. This form is valued for its distinctive shape and potential use in breeding programs for improved potato traits."
