    "intro": "Sium difformum, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland environments. Sium difformum is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams."
