    "intro": "Solidago simplex var. ontarioensis, commonly known as the Ontario goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variant of Solidago simplex is distinguished by its geographical distribution and specific ecological preferences."
