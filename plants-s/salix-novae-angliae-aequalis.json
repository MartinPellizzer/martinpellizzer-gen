    "intro": "Salix novae-angliae aequalis, commonly known as the eastern willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, or along the edges of forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
