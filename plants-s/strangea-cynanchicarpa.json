    "intro": "Strangea cynanchicarpa, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is considered threatened by environmental changes and habitat loss."
