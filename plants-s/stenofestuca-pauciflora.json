    "intro": "Stenofestuca pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered narrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has narrow, upright blades with a rough texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its low-growing habit and minimal floral display. Stenofestuca pauciflora is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
