    "intro": "Syncephalum stenoclinoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and the stems are often branched and upright. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
