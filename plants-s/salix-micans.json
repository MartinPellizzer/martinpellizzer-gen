    "intro": "Salix micans, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, ovate leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix micans is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
