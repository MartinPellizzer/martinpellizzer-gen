    "intro": "Scaevola coccinea, commonly known as the coral bells or red sand mat, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant red or pink flowers in clusters. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Scaevola coccinea is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun to partial shade."
