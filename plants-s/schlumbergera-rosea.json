    "intro": "Schlumbergera rosea, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a popular epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, leaf-like stems that are typically green with red or pink veins. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, usually blooming around the holiday season. Schlumbergera rosea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a favored houseplant worldwide."
