    "intro": "Salix lemmonii var. macrostachya, commonly known as the Lemmon willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Its growth habit is generally upright, with multiple stems arising from the base. The leaves are usually gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
