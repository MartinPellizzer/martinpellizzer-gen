    "intro": "Salix retusa var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological stability and wildlife habitat."
