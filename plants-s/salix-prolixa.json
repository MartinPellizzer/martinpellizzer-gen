    "intro": "Salix prolixa, commonly known as the Eurasian weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The plant has slender, gray-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and they turn yellow in the autumn. Salix prolixa is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
