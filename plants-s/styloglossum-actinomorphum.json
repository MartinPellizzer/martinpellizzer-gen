    "intro": "Styloglossum actinomorphum, commonly known as the star-shaped ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring multiple petals that radiate outward in a star-like pattern. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Styloglossum actinomorphum is epiphytic, growing on trees without deriving nutrients from them, and relies on a specialized relationship with fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
