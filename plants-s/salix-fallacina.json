    "intro": "Salix fallacina, commonly known as the false white willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a grayish-green underside. Salix fallacina is often found in wetland environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
