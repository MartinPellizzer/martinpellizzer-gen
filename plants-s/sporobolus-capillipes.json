    "intro": "Sporobolus capillipes, commonly known as silky threadgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sporobolus capillipes is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in xeric habitats."
