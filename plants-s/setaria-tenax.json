    "intro": "Setaria tenax, commonly known as rough fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Setaria tenax is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates makes it a resilient and widespread species."
