    "intro": "Stachys pilifera subsp. pilifera, commonly known as velvetleaf betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces spikes of showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
