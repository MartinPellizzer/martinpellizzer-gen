It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its densely hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a prominent midrib. The flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and the plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife."
