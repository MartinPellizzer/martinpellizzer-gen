    "intro": "Stelis gigapetala, commonly known as the giant petal stelis, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinct, elongated lip that is highly specialized for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
