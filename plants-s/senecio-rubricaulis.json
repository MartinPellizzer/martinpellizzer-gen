    "intro": "Senecio rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It has a low-growing habit and produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
