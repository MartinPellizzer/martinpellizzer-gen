    "intro": "Selaginella frondosa var. frondosa, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky soils or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that are often green or reddish in color. It produces strobila, which are cone-like structures containing spores, and is adapted to survive in arid conditions through its ability to retain moisture. This species is widely distributed across North America and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks."
