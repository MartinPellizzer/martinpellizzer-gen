    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. brevistylum, commonly known as the compact snowflake, is a low-growing succulent native to the Pyrenees region. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a rosette shape, adapted to retain moisture in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a desirable addition to xeriscaped landscapes."
