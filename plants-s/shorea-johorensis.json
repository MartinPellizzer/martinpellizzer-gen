    "intro": "Shorea johorensis, commonly known as the Johore ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its heavy, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has large, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in spikes. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems. Shorea johorensis is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it an important component of old-growth tropical forests."
