    "intro": "Solidago elliottii, commonly known as Elliott's goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Elliott's goldenrod plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
