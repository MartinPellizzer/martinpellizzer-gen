    "intro": "Selinum scabrum, commonly known as rough stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically during the summer months. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Selinum scabrum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
