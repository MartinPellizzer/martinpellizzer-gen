It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, tubular flowers arranged in dense, rounded inflorescences. The flowers are typically red or purple, with two lips that are characteristic of the Salvia genus. The plant has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens."
