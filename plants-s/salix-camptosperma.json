    "intro": "Salix camptosperma, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. Salix camptosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks."
