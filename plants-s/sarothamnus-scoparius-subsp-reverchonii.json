    "intro": "Sarothamnus scoparius subsp. reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's thornstep, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
