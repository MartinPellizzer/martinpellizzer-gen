    "intro": "Sambucus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive elderberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or black when mature, though they are toxic to humans and animals. Sambucus decipiens thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it distinct from other elderberry species, particularly in its appearance and ecological role."
