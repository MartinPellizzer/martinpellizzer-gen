    "intro": "Sanguisorba yezoensis, commonly known as Yezo sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Japan and parts of Russia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly sour taste due to its high concentration of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Sanguisorba yezoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and flowering display."
