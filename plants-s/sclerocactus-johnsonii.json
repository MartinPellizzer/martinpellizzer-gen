    "intro": "Sclerocactus johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright green, spineless stems that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible fruits resembling small, green figs. Sclerocactus johnsonii is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important plant in its native habitat."
