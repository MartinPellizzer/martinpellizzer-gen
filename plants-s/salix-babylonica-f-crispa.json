    "intro": "Salix babylonica f. crispa, commonly known as the weeping willow with crinkled leaves, is a cultivar of the weeping willow that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are crinkled and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters typical of willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value comes from its cascading branches and unique leaf texture."
