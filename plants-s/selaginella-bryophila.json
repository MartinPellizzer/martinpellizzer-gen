    "intro": "Selaginella bryophila, commonly known as the moss spikemoss, is a small, primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves, which are typically scale-like. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in cone-like structures, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Selaginella bryophila is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in various habitats."
