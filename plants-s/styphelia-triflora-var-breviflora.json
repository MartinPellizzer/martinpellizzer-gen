    "intro": "Styphelia triflora var. breviflora, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, bell-shaped white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dunes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
