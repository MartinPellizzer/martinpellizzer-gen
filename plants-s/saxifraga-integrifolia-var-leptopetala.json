    "intro": "Saxifraga integrifolia var. leptopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features basal rosettes of elliptic, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Saxifraga integrifolia."
