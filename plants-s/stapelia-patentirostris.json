    "intro": "Stapelia patentirostris, commonly known as the \"Cape Town Stapelia,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with prominent veins. These flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, due to their strong scent and appearance. Stapelia patentirostris is often grown as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique aesthetic."
