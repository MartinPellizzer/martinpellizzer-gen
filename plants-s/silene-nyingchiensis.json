    "intro": "Silene nyingchiensis, commonly known as the Nyingchi sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in arid, rocky environments and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
