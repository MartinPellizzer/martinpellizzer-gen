    "intro": "Scandix aristata, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped basal leaves and clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
