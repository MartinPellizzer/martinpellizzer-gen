    "intro": "Schoepfia jasminodora, commonly known as the jasmine datura, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow and often emit a sweet, jasmine-like fragrance. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and can become woody with age. Schoepfia jasminodora is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and its role in attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
