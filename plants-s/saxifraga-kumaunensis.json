    "intro": "Saxifraga kumaunensis, commonly known as the Kumaun saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
