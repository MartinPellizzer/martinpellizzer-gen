    "intro": "Salmia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf salvia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its attractive floral display. Salmia latifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
