It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor securely in harsh, wind-swept habitats. Saussurea crupinastrum is often found in meadows and slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
