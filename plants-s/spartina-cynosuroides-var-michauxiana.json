    "intro": "Spartina cynosuroides var. michauxiana, commonly known as Michaux's cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Atlantic coastal regions of North America. It typically grows in brackish or salt marsh environments, thriving in wet, muddy soils along tidal flats and estuaries. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense stands, and its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are arranged in spikelets. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
