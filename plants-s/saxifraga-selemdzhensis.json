    "intro": "Saxifraga selemdzhensis, commonly known as the Selmdzhenskaya saxifrage, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
