    "intro": "Selaginella breweriana, commonly known as the Brewer's spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions through its succulent, scale-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain spores for reproduction. Its unique morphology includes a creeping stem with dense, linear leaves that give it a moss-like appearance. Selaginella breweriana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
