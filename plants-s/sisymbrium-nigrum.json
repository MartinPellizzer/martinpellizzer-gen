    "intro": "Sisymbrium nigrum, commonly known as black mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender stems and pinnately divided leaves, with small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are typically black or dark brown in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Black mustard is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread easily, making it both a weed and a plant of ecological significance."
