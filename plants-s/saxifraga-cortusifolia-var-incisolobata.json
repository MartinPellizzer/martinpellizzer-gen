    "intro": "Saxifraga cortusifolia var. incisolobata, commonly known as the serrated-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a compact rosette of basal leaves that are typically grayish-green and have a distinctive serrated or incised margin. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a terminal inflorescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
