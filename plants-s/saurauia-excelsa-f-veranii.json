    "intro": "Saurauia excelsa f. veranii, commonly known as the Vanuatu star jasmine, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Vanuatu. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid tropical forests. Its foliage is evergreen, with glossy, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
