    "intro": "Senna glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 12 to 20 pairs of leaflets, and its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Senna glutinosa is known for its sticky resinous sap, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands."
