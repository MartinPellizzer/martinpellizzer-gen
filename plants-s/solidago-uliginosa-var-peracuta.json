It is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, such as those found in marshes and bogs. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological diversity in its native range."
