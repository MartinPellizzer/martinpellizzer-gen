    "intro": "Smilax china var. macrocarpa, commonly known as Chinese smilax, is a perennial vine native to eastern Asia. It features a thick, woody stem with sharp, spiny ridges and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Smilax china var. macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
