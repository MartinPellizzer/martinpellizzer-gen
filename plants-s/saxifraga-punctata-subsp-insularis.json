    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata subsp. insularis, commonly known as the island saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to specific island habitats in the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal or island environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
