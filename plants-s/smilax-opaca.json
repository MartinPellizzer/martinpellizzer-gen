    "intro": "Smilax opaca, commonly known as the common smilax, is a woody perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a robust root system and produces stout, thorny stems that climb or trail along the ground. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it bears small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Smilax opaca is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its persistent foliage and berries make it a notable component of the understory in native plant communities."
