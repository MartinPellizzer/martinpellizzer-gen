This plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is native to regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a distinctive silver or grayish-green color due to the thick layer of fine pubescence. The flowers are small, typically yellow or white, and the fruit is a spherical berry that ripens to a deep blue or purple. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique texture, making it a popular choice in specialty gardens."
