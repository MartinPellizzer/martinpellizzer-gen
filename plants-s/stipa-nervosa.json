    "intro": "Stipa nervosa, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to the ecological stability of these ecosystems. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its native habitat."
