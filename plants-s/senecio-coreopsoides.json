    "intro": "Senecio coreopsoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation across open, disturbed habitats. Senecio coreopsoides is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to desert and semi-desert ecosystems."
