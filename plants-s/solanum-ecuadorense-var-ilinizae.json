    "intro": "Solanum ecuadorense var. ilinizae, commonly known as the Iliniz\u00e1 solanum, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, egg-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
