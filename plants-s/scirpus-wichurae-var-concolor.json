It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically green on both sides, giving it a uniform appearance. The plant produces tall, cylindrical spikes of small, inconspicuous flowers that are primarily wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
