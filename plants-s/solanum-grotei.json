    "intro": "Solanum grotei, commonly known as the Groot's nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the fruit is a small, berry-like structure that turns red when mature. Solanum grotei is adapted to survive in harsh environments, showcasing resilience through its deep root system and water-storing tissues."
