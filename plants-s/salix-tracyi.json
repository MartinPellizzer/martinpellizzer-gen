    "intro": "Salix tracyi, commonly known as Tracy's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, fragrant leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Tracy's willow is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
