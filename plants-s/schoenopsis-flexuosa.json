    "intro": "Schoenopsis flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible spiny grass, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its wiry, spiny stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Schoenopsis flexuosa is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
