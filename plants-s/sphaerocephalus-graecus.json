    "intro": "Sphaerocephalus graecus, commonly known as the Greek globe lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its rounded, disc-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal component, which together provide the necessary nutrients for survival. It is often found on tree bark and rocks in temperate and subtropical regions. Its slow growth and distinctive morphology make it a notable species in ecological and taxonomic studies."
