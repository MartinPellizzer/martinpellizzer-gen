    "intro": "Schedonorus interruptus, commonly known as the meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Schedonorus interruptus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in turfgrass and forage production."
