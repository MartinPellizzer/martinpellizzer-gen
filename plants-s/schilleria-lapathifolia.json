It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fibrous roots and is characterized by its alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Schilleria lapathifolia is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
