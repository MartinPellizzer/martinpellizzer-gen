    "intro": "Salix melanopsis var. tenerrima, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying alpine flora."
