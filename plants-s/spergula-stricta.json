    "intro": "Spergula stricta, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers in spike-like clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Spergula stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
