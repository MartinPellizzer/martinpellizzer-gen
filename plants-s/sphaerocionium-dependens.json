    "intro": "Sphaerocionium dependens, commonly known as the hanging bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowering stems bear small, yellowish flowers. Sphaerocionium dependens is primarily found in temperate regions and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling."
