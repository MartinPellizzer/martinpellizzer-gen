    "intro": "Solanum villosum var. miniatum, commonly known as the miniature hairy nightshade, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that give way to small, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and compact size. However, like many members of its family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
