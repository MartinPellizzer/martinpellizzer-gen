    "intro": "Sinopodophyllum hexandrum var. chinense, commonly known as Chinese mayapple, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like cluster of leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent understory plant in shaded forest environments. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its roots and berries, which require caution during handling or consumption."
