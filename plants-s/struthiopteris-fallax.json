    "intro": "Struthiopteris fallax, commonly known as the fallax wood fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically divided into pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. Struthiopteris fallax prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
