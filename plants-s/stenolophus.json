    "intro": "Stenolophus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are commonly found in wetlands and disturbed soils. Stenolophus species typically produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The genus is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
