It is a low-growing annual herb with small, white flowers that are often reduced or absent in this variety. The plant features rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and along pathways. Its botanical characteristics make it distinguishable from the typical form of Stellaria media."
