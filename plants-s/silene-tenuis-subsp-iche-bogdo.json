    "intro": "Silene tenuis subsp. iche-bogdo, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils typical of bogs and fens. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the moist, often waterlogged conditions of its habitat. It plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining the biodiversity of its wetland environment."
