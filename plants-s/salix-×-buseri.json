It is a natural hybrid between Salix viminalis and Salix triandra, characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is typically found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, elongated fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Salix \u00d7 buseri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
