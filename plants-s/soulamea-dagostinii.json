    "intro": "Soulamea dagostinii, commonly known as the Dagostini's soulamea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it has a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Soulamea dagostinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
