    "intro": "Syngonanthus humboldtii var. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a hairy or glandular surface that gives it its varietal name. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks."
