    "intro": "Seseli tschuiliense, commonly known as the Caucasian seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showing a preference for well-drained soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
