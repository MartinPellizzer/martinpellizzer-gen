    "intro": "Senecio andicola var. pseudonitidus, commonly known as the Andean groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, densely packed yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range."
