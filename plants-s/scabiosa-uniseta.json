    "intro": "Scabiosa uniseta, commonly known as the single-flowered scabious, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Scabiosa uniseta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
