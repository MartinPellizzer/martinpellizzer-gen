    "intro": "Sturmia gregaria, commonly known as the clustered sturmia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shrubland habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Its seeds are encased in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range. Sturmia gregaria is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
