    "intro": "Stangea, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its thick, often ribbed stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Stangea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion."
