    "intro": "Sium nodiflorum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its roots are often harvested for culinary or medicinal use. Sium nodiflorum is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it an important indicator species for wetland health. Its presence often signifies a well-functioning aquatic ecosystem."
