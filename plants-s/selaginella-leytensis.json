    "intro": "Selaginella leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures called strobila. Selaginella leytensis is characterized by its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures. It is native to the Philippines, particularly the island of Leyte, and is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary and ecological significance."
