    "intro": "Stipa pennata var. dasyphylla, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that form a compact clump. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray panicles that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
