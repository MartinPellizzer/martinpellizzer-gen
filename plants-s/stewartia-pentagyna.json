    "intro": "Stewartia pentagyna, commonly known as the five-angled stewartia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Stewartia pentagyna is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and floral display."
