It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink.

Its unique floral structure and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts. Sinabraca carinata plays an important role in its ecosystem, supporting various pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
