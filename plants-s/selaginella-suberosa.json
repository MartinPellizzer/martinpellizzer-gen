    "intro": "Selaginella suberosa, commonly known as the sticky spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorls of small, scale-like leaves, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobila. Selaginella suberosa is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including drought, due to its specialized adaptations. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and resilience."
