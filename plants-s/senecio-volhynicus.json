    "intro": "Senecio volhynicus, commonly known as the Volhynian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
