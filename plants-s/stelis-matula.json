    "intro": "Stelis matula, commonly known as the Matula orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are typically ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis matula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
