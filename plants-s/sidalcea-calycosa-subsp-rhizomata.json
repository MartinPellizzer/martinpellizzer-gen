    "intro": "Sidalcea calycosa subsp. rhizomata, commonly known as the root-stem sidalcea, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. The plant typically features pink to purple flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are pinnately divided with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and wetlands. Botanically, it is noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
