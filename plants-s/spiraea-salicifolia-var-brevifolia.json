    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, silvery underside that adds to its ornamental appeal. This variety is more compact than the typical Spiraea salicifolia, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, thriving in cooler climates."
