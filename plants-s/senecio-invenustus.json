    "intro": "Senecio invenustus, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
