    "intro": "Spartina maritima, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. It thrives in brackish and saline environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has long, slender leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Spartina maritima plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
