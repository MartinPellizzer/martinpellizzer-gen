    "intro": "Sonchus \u00d7 clujensis, commonly known as the Clujensis sowthistle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble those of other dandelion-like species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is native to Europe but has been introduced to other regions, where it sometimes becomes invasive. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
