    "intro": "Salsola squarrosa, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or upright growth habit, with hairy stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in arid and saline environments due to its succulent leaves and deep root system. It produces abundant seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Salsola squarrosa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
