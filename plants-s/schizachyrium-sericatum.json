    "intro": "Schizachyrium sericatum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies and woodlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Schizachyrium sericatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
