    "intro": "Senegalia ricoae, commonly known as the Rio Grande pricklypear, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and paddle-shaped leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a spherical, spiny structure that contains edible seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Senegalia ricoae plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
