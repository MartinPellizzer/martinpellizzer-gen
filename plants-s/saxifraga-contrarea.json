    "intro": "Saxifraga contrarea, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Siberia. It is a low-growing perennial with rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga contrarea is often found in alpine meadows and is a characteristic species of mountain flora."
