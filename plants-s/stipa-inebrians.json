    "intro": "Stipa inebrians, commonly known as the drunken grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that produce a profuse display of tiny, pale green to brown florets. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while its roots form dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Stipa inebrians is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
