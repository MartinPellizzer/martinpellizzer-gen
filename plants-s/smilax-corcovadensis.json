    "intro": "Smilax corcovadensis, commonly known as the arrowhead vine, is a woody, climbing plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It features a thick, tuberous root system that stores nutrients and allows it to survive in dry conditions. The plant has compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and its stems are covered in sharp, spiny projections. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments."
