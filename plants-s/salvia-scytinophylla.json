It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy foliage and spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Salvia scytinophylla is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
