    "intro": "Sulcorebutia cantargalloensis var. torrepampensis, commonly known as the Pampas stone cactus, is a compact, low-growing species native to the arid regions of Argentina. It features a short, thick stem that often remains below ground, with clusters of fleshy, ribbed stems emerging from the base. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring, which are typically borne on short, hairy pedicels. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance."
