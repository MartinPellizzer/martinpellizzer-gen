    "intro": "Seseli saxicola, commonly known as the rock seseli, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in crevices and on limestone, adapting to poor soil conditions and limited water availability. Its structure is compact, with a short stem and basal leaves that help reduce water loss. Seseli saxicola plays a role in stabilizing rocky soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
