    "intro": "Salix fluviatilis, commonly known as the river willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is characterized by its flexible, slender branches. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and has small, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
