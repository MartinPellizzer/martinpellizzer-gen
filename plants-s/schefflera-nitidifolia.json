    "intro": "Schefflera nitidifolia, commonly known as the shining umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like cluster of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor decoration due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
