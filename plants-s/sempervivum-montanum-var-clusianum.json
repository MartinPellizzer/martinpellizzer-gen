    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum var. clusianum, commonly known as the Clusian cushion plant, is a succulent species native to the Pyrenees and southern France. It forms dense, low-growing mats of fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues. The plant is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its leaves are thick and water-storing, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in spring, typically in shades of pink or white."
