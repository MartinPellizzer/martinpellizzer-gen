    "intro": "Sagittaria planitiana, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and has arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by dark, spherical berries. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Sagittaria planitiana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
