    "intro": "Saussurea delavayi var. hirsuta, commonly known as the Hairy Saussurea, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers arranged in a complex inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and alpine habitats, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
