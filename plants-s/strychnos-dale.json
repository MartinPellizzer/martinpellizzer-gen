    "intro": "Strychnos dale, commonly known as the red sanders, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. It is valued for its durable and aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
