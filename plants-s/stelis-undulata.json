    "intro": "Stelis undulata, commonly known as the wavy stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, branching structure with narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its epiphytic lifestyle. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinct wavy pattern on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Stelis undulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
