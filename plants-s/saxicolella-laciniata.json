    "intro": "Saxicolella laciniata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, perennial epiphytic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble ferns. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in cool, humid environments. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense, moss-like layer that helps retain moisture. Saxicolella laciniata is well adapted to its harsh, mountainous habitat, showcasing remarkable resilience to extreme conditions."
