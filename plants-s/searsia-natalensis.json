    "intro": "Searsia natalensis, commonly known as Natal glory bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, spreading branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by orange-red berries that attract birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are typically elliptical with toothed margins and turn yellow in autumn."
