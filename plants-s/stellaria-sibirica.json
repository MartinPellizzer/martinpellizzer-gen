    "intro": "Stellaria sibirica, commonly known as Siberian starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Stellaria sibirica is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes."
