    "intro": "Senecio ilkasiensis, commonly known as the Ilkasiensis groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations above 2,500 meters. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
