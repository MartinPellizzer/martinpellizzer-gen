    "intro": "Stobaea radula, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, where it forms a crust-like structure on surfaces such as stone, soil, or wood. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its symbiotic partners for nutrients and photosynthesis. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and provides habitat for microorganisms. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important indicator of environmental health."
