    "intro": "Snowdenia, commonly known as the Welsh flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountains of Wales. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, white, umbel-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in limestone-rich habitats. Snowdenia is known for its short flowering period, typically in late spring, and its ability to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a protected species in Wales."
