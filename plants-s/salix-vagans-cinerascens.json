It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, pale green leaves that often have a grayish or whitish underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. The bark of Salix vagans cinerascens is smooth and gray, giving it a distinctive appearance in its natural habitat."
