It is characterized by its striking blue-violet bracts that surround small white flowers, creating a mist-like appearance. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can extend from spring through fall."
