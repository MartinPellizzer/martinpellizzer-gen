    "intro": "Senecio uspallatensis var. retroflexus, commonly known as the retroflex senecio, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to high altitudes and cool climates. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
