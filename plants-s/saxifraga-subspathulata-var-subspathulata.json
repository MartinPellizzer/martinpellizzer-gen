    "intro": "Saxifraga subspathulata var. subspathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
