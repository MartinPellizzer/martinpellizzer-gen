    "intro": "Specklinia trichyphis, commonly known as the hairy-veined staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, branching fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures that aid in moisture retention. Specklinia trichyphis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
