    "intro": "Salix interior f. wheeleri, commonly known as Wheeler's interior willow, is a rare and unique form of the interior willow. It is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically inconspicuous but play a key role in its reproductive cycle. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
