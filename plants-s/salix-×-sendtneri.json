It is characterized by its weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. The plant has slender, light green leaves that are oval in shape and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. Salix \u00d7 sendtneri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist environments."
