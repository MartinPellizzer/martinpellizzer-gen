    "intro": "Senna hirsuta var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy senna, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. The flowers are yellow and clustered in racemes, producing a distinctive, sweet scent that attracts pollinators. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
