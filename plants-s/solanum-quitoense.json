    "intro": "Solanum quitoense, commonly known as the Quito nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Solanum quitoense is part of the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves."
