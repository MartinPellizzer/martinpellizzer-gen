    "intro": "Samolus ebracteatus var. ebracteatus, commonly known as the smooth samolus, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are usually smooth and lance-shaped. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
