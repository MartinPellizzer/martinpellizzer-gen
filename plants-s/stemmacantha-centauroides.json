    "intro": "Stemmacantha centauroides, commonly known as the centaur's thorn, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that is often branched and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, slender stalks. Its leaves are small, oval-shaped, and typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
