    "intro": "Schoenus fabri, commonly known as the African flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often greenish or brownish in color. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Schoenus fabri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
