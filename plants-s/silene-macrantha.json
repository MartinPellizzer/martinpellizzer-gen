    "intro": "Silene macrantha, commonly known as the tall catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Silene macrantha is an important component of native plant communities and is often found in conservation areas."
