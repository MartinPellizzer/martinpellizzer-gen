    "intro": "Strychnos guianensis, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces woody, spindle-shaped fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. It is known for containing toxic alkaloids, such as strychnine and brucine, which are found in its seeds and roots. Despite its toxic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
