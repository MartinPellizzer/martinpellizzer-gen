    "intro": "Scirpus swampianus, commonly known as bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous wetland plant native to North America. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow in dense clusters, and it produces cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers. The plant is often found in shallow water or moist soil along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Scirpus swampianus is also valued for its ability to filter water and support diverse wildlife."
