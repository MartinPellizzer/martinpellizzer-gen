    "intro": "Schizoglossum consimile, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on the bark of trees in wetlands or swamps. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a slender, almost stemless appearance with a single, delicate flower that is often pale green or white. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the surrounding substrates. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts."
