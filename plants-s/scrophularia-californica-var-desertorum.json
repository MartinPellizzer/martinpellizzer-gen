    "intro": "Scrophularia californica var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert monkeyflower, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This species is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions, making it a resilient member of the local flora."
