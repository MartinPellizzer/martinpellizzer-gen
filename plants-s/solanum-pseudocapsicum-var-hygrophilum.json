    "intro": "Solanum pseudocapsicum var. hygrophilum, commonly known as the water nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, green to purple stems and broad, ovate leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spherical, fleshy fruits resembling miniature tomatoes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but studied for its ecological roles."
