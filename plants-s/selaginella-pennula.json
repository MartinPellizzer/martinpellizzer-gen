    "intro": "Selaginella pennula, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a prostrate or ascending stem with closely packed, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella pennula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
