    "intro": "Stevia stricta, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rich in steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring compounds used as a sweetener. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are the primary part used, and they are often harvested and processed for their intense sweet taste. Stevia stricta is well adapted to tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
