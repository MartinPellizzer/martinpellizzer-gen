    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon periplocifolium f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate stigmaphyllon, is a rare plant species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to the humid and shaded environments of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
