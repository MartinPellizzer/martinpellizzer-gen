    "intro": "Sium podolicum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and riparian areas in North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with a hollow, ridged stem that is often used for water transport. Its roots are edible and have a flavor similar to parsnips, though they are less commonly consumed. Sium podolicum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
