    "intro": "Sphaeropteris fugax, commonly known as the fugitive cyclosorus, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, compact rhizome system that helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged in a circular pattern on the undersides of the fronds. Sphaeropteris fugax is often found in tropical rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
