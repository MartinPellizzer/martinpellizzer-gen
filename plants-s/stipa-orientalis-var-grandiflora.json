It features slender, wiry stems that grow up to 1.5 meters tall, adorned with narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces panicles of delicate, light green to yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping in arid regions."
