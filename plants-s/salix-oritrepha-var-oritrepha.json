    "intro": "Salix oritrepha var. oritrepha, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The Kashmir willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
