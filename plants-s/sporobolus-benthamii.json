    "intro": "Sporobolus benthamii, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has narrow, needle-like leaves and produces spiky, three-awned inflorescences that are characteristic of the genus Sporobolus. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
