    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis f. laxa, commonly known as the loose-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wool, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine settings."
