    "intro": "Stangea rhizantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a monotypic genus, meaning it is the only species within its group, and it belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate, white, waxy flowers that bloom on a slender stem. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks, often in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its rarity and its role in ecological studies of specialized plant adaptations."
