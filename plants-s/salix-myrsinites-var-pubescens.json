    "intro": "Salix myrsinites var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its leaves turn a striking yellow in autumn, making it a notable ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows."
