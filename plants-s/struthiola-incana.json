It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics and ability to store water in its fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its hairy, silver-gray foliage helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Struthiola incana is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
