    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. melanocerasum, commonly known as black nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1\u20132 meters, with hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive purple calyx, and the berries are toxic when unripe but can be used in some traditional cuisines when fully mature. The species is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use is often limited due to its potential toxicity."
