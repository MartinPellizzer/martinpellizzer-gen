    "intro": "Schedonorus sterilis, commonly known as the sterile bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, soft blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, which helps it blend into its natural habitat. Schedonorus sterilis is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes but is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
