    "intro": "Stelis, commonly known as the orchid genus, is a diverse group of epiphytic and lithophytic plants found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. These plants typically have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting their growth in nutrient-poor environments. Their roots are often aerial, allowing them to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Stelis species produce showy, often fragrant flowers in a variety of colors, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes over 200 species, many of which are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value."
