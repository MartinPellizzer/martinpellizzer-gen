    "intro": "Styrax seminatus, commonly known as the sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Styracaceae and is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and spiky, seed-filled capsules. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
