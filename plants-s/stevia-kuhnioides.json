    "intro": "Stevia kuhnioides, commonly known as Kuhni's stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its high concentration of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners that are much sweeter than table sugar. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for both ornamental and medicinal cultivation. Due to its medicinal properties, it is increasingly being studied for its potential health benefits."
