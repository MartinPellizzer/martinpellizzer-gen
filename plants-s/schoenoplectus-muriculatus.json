    "intro": "Schoenoplectus muriculatus, commonly known as the prickly bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread vegetatively, contributing to its success in wetland habitats. Schoenoplectus muriculatus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
