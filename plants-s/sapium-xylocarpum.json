It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and usually ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
