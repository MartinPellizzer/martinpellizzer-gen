    "intro": "Sagittaria heterophylla var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with narrow, linear leaves emerging from the water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Sagittaria species, making it easily identifiable in wetland ecosystems."
