It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Saccolena is native to the Americas and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in many regions."
