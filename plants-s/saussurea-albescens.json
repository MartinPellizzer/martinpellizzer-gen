    "intro": "Saussurea albescens, commonly known as the white saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale yellow to white ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
