It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, seed-filled spheres. Senecio tataricus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
