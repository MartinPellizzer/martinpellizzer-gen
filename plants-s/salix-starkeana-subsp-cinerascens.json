    "intro": "Salix starkeana subsp. cinerascens, commonly known as the gray willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grayish-brown branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, ashen-colored bark and its preference for cooler, high-altitude habitats."
