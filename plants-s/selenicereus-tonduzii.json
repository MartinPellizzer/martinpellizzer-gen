    "intro": "Selenicereus tonduzii, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a climbing cactus native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its segmented, spiny stems and its ability to climb by means of aerial roots. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night and last only a few hours. These flowers are typically followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Selenicereus tonduzii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
