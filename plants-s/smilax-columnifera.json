    "intro": "Smilax columnifera, commonly known as the evergreen climbing smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Smilax columnifera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its hardy nature and ability to climb make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Smilacaceae family."
