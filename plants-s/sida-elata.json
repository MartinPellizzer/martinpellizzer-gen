    "intro": "Sida elata, commonly known as the slender sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida elata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
