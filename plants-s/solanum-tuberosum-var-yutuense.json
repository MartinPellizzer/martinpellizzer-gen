The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and exhibits typical solanum features such as alternate leaves and solanaceous flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability."
