    "intro": "Selaginella copelandii, commonly known as the maidenhair spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, spirally arranged leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a distinctive zigzag pattern. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Selaginella copelandii has a unique ability to survive drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are cone-like and produce spores for propagation."
