    "intro": "Siphocampylus tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it often grows in rocky or gravelly soils.
