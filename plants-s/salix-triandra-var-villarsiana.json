    "intro": "Salix triandra var. villarsiana, commonly known as the African willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and long, narrow leaves that are typically green on top and pale white or silvery underneath. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riverine habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. The species is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
