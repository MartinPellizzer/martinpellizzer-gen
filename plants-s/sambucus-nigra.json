    "intro": "Sambucus nigra, commonly known as European elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into 5 to 11 oval-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark purple to black berries in the fall, which are rich in antioxidants and used in culinary and medicinal applications. Sambucus nigra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along stream banks. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
