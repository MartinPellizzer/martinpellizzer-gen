    "intro": "Sesleria heufleriana f. prorepens, commonly known as the prorepens form of Heufler's feather grass, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, pale blue to white florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to form attractive ground covers in gardens."
