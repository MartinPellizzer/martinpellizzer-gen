    "intro": "Syzygium trukense, commonly known as the Truk Island apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale pink, followed by edible, round fruits with a crisp, juicy texture. Syzygium trukense is adapted to grow in coastal areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
