    "intro": "Salvia hyemalis, commonly known as winter sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking silver-gray foliage. The plant produces tall spikes of violet-blue flowers in the early spring, before many other plants begin to bloom. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for attracting pollinators and adding visual interest to gardens during the colder months."
