It features upright, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The leaves and stems are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
