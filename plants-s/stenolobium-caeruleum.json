    "intro": "Stenolobium caeruleum, commonly known as the blue sycamore, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces striking blue or violet flower clusters that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, giving the plant a delicate appearance. The wood of Stenolobium caeruleum is lightweight and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including construction and crafts."
