    "intro": "Solanum multiglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in small glands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other familiar plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and landscapes."
