    "intro": "Salix tomentosa var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the woolly willow or round-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray pubescent leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, or along riverbanks. Its leaves are oval to round in shape, with a thick, leathery texture, and they turn yellow in autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
