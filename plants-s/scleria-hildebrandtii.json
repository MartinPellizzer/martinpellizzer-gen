It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Scleria hildebrandtii is often found in damp or wet habitats such as marshes and riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments."
