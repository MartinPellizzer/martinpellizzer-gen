    "intro": "Schefflera latiligulata, commonly known as the broadleaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has dark green, leathery foliage that remains throughout the year, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Schefflera latiligulata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
