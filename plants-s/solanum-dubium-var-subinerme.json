It is native to parts of South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay, and thrives in dry, open habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers and hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Its fruits are typically small berries that turn red when mature, and the plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
