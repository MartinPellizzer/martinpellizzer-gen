    "intro": "Stelis cavernosa, commonly known as the cave orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate, and it is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Stelis cavernosa is a popular specimen among orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
