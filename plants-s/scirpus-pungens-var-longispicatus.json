    "intro": "Scirpus pungens var. longispicatus, commonly known as the tall spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, covered in dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface."
