    "intro": "Schoenefeldia ramosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing habit with numerous stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Schoenefeldia ramosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to various soil types."
