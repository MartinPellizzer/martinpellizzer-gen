    "intro": "Solidago caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features upright stems that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Solidago caroliniana plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late growing season."
