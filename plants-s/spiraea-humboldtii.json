It is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has slender, arching branches covered in fine, silvery hair. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green surface and a slightly hairy underside. Spiraea humboldtii is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
