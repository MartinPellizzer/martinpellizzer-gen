It is characterized by its distinctive spiny leaves and purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its scientific name comes from the Greek word \"silybum,\" referring to its resemblance to the liver-shaped leaves of the plant.
