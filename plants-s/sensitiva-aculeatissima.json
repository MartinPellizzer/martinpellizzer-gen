    "intro": "Sensitiva aculeatissima, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnately compound leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by seed pods that burst open when mature. Its rapid leaf movements are due to changes in turgor pressure within specialized cells called pulvini. This plant is often cultivated as a curiosity due to its unique and reactive behavior."
