    "intro": "Sasa bicolor, commonly known as the silver fern, is a clump-forming evergreen bamboo native to eastern Asia. It features slender, arching culms covered in a distinctive silvery-white sheath that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by triangular, edible fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
