    "intro": "Schmardaea nobilis, commonly known as the noble schmardaea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its blooming period occurs during the spring and early summer, producing vibrant pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Schmardaea nobilis is considered a species of conservation concern."
