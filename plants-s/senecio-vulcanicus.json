    "intro": "Senecio vulcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its daisy-like inflorescence, consisting of yellow ray florets surrounding a central cluster of tubular disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio vulcanicus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates."
