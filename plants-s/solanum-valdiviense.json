    "intro": "Solanum valdiviense, commonly known as the Valdivian nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Solanum valdiviense thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat."
