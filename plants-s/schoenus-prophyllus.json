    "intro": "Schoenus prophyllus, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
