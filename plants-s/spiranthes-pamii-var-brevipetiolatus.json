    "intro": "Spiranthes pamii var. brevipetiolatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with short petioles that distinguish it from other varieties. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
