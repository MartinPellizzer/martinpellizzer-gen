    "intro": "Sedum reptans, commonly known as the stonecrop or carpet sedum, is a low-growing succulent native to Eurasia. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens and ground covers. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
