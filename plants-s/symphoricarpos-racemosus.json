    "intro": "Symphoricarpos racemosus, commonly known as snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture, and it thrives in a variety of soil types. Snowberry is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas across the United States and Canada."
