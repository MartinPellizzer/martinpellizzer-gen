    "intro": "Stevia salviifolia, commonly known as the sweetleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, slightly hairy leaves that emit a sweet scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain high levels of steviol glycosides, natural compounds used as a sweetener. Stevia salviifolia is often cultivated for both ornamental and commercial purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and functional value."
