    "intro": "Senecio collinus, commonly known as the Colorado blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has bluish-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Senecio collinus is often found in open areas such as meadows and along stream banks."
