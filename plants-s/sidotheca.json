    "intro": "Sidotheca, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, yellowish flowers. The leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while the flowers are followed by spherical, dry fruits called achenes. Sidotheca species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental appeal."
