    "intro": "Selaginella barrancae, commonly known as the Barranca clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant features a creeping stem with spirally arranged leaves that are often scale-like in appearance. Selaginella barrancae reproduces through spores, which are produced in specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. This plant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat."
