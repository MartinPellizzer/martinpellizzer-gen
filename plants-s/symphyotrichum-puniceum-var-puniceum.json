It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. The flowers consist of a yellow central disk surrounded by ray florets, making it a popular choice for native gardens and pollinator habitats."
