    "intro": "Siphocampylus microstoma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Mexico and Guatemala. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its flowers are white to pale yellow and are arranged in compact umbels, typical of the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
