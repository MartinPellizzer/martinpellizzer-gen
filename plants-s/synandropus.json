    "intro": "Synandropus, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces a tall, branching stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Synandropus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
