    "intro": "Seseli aristatum, commonly known as the Sierra cliff bladderpod, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Seseli aristatum is often found growing on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
