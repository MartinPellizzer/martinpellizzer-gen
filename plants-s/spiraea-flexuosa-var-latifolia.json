It features upright, arching stems covered in dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil.
