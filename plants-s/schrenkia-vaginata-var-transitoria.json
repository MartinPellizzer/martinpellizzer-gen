    "intro": "Schrenkia vaginata var. transitoria, commonly known as the transient bulbous orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bulbous root system and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers during the brief summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, arid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
