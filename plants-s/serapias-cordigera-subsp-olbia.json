It typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas, thriving in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces erect flowering stems with showy, yellow-orange flowers that have a distinctive hooded shape. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower coloration compared to other members of the Serapias genus."
