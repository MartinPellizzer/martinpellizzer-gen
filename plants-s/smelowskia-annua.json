    "intro": "Smelowskia annua, commonly known as the annual smelowskia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Smelowskia annua is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more widely researched plants."
