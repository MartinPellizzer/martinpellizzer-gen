    "intro": "Salmia humilis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Salmia humilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
