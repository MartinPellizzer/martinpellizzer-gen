    "intro": "Sebaea macroptera, commonly known as the large-leaf sebaea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic plants, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Sebaea macroptera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
