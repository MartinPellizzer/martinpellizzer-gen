    "intro": "Sedum berunii, commonly known as the Berun's stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to parts of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Sedum berunii is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
