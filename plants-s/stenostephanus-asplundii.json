    "intro": "Stenostephanus asplundii, commonly known as the Asplund's stephanus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically broad and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to collect moisture from the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
