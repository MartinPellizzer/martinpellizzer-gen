    "intro": "Stipa rubens subsp. rubentiformis, commonly known as the redflower needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of bright red to orange inflorescences, which give it its striking visual appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
