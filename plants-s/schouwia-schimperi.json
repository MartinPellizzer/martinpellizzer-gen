    "intro": "Schouwia schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble small orchids. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schouwia schimperi is considered a delicate and endangered species."
