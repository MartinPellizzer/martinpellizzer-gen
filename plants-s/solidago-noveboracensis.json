    "intro": "Solidago noveboracensis, commonly known as New York goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. New York goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, during the late season."
