It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often scale-like or needle-shaped. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella rionegrensis is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
