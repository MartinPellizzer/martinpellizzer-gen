    "intro": "Sida wallichii, commonly known as Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
