    "intro": "Sida argentina var. tucumanensis, commonly known as the Tucum\u00e1n sida, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Argentina and parts of Bolivia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it an important species in ecological studies of semi-arid regions."
