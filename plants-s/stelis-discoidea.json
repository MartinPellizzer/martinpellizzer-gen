    "intro": "Stelis discoidea, commonly known as the orchid with a white and green striped stem, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its unique, often pendulous inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and fragrant, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination. Stelis discoidea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
