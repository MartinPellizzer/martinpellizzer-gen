    "intro": "Shorea schefferiana, commonly known as the Philippine teak, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, aromatic wood. The plant has large, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, while its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its high commercial value, Shorea schefferiana is also considered an endangered species."
