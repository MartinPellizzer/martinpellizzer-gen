It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
