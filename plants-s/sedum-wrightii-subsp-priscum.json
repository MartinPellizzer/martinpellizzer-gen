    "intro": "Sedum wrightii subsp. priscum, commonly known as the ancient stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its historical significance is reflected in its subspecies name, \"priscum,\" meaning ancient."
