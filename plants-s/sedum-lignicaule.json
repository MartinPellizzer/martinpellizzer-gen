    "intro": "Sedum lignicaule, commonly known as the upright stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, cylindrical leaves that store water, aiding in its drought tolerance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, including colder regions."
