It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually opposite, elliptical, and covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
