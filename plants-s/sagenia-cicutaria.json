    "intro": "Sagenia cicutaria, commonly known as the common water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy areas, thriving in moist soil conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by water, contributing to its spread in aquatic environments. Sagenia cicutaria is often found along riverbanks and in damp meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
