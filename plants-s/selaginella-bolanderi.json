    "intro": "Selaginella bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander's spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, spiky stems and small, scale-like leaves. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella bolanderi is often found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon."
