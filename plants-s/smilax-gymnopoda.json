    "intro": "Smilax gymnopoda, commonly known as the smooth smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and the presence of spines along its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its berries are initially green and turn red when ripe, attracting various bird species. Smilax gymnopoda is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
