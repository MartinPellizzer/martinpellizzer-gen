    "intro": "Serianthes myriadenia var. rurutensis, commonly known as the Rurut\u00e9 tree, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It is a large, evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its buttressed roots and thick, flaky bark. The leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while the flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, the species is considered critically endangered."
