    "intro": "Senecio micaniiformis, commonly known as the woolly senecio, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
