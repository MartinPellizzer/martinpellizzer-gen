    "intro": "Sonchus bupleurifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Sonchus bupleurifolius is often found in disturbed soils and can become a weed in agricultural settings."
