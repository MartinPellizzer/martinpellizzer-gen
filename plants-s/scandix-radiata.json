    "intro": "Scandix radiata, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. Scandix radiata is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and it plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types makes it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides."
