    "intro": "Stellaria laxmannii, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are oval to lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stellaria laxmannii is often found in meadows and along the edges of forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these habitats."
