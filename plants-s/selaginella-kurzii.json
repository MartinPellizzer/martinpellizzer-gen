It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky substrates. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around its stems. Selaginella kurzii is known for its ability to survive in harsh, dry environments due to its specialized water-storing tissues. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
