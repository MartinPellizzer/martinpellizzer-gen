    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon var. rufescens, commonly known as the red sand saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils and access limited moisture. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in extreme conditions, making it a hardy example of desert flora."
