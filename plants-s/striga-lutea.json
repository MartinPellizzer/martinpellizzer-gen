    "intro": "Striga lutea, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is native to Africa, where it is considered a significant agricultural pest. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth of its host, and it can severely weaken or even kill the host plant. Due to its parasitic nature and impact on crops, Striga lutea is a major concern in regions where food security is already challenged."
