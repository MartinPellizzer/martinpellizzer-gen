It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and distinctive, fluffy seed heads that resemble a fox's tail. This plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It has a C4 photosynthetic pathway, which allows it to thrive in hot and dry environments. The foliage and seed heads are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal."
