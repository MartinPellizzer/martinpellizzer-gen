    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara, commonly known as bindweed or woody nightshade, is a perennial vine native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature, though they are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum dulcamara thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along fences, walls, and woodland edges. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in gardens and natural areas."
