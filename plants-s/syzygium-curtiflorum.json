    "intro": "Syzygium curtiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing edible seeds. Syzygium curtiflorum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural practices."
