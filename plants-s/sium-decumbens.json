    "intro": "Sium decumbens, commonly known as swamp cowpea, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several small, bean-like seeds. Sium decumbens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing food for various wildlife species."
