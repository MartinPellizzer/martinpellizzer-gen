    "intro": "Salix jejuna, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils near streams or wetlands. Salix jejuna is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing stream banks."
