    "intro": "Sorbus humifusa, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
