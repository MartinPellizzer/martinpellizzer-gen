    "intro": "Stipa pennata var. minor, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
