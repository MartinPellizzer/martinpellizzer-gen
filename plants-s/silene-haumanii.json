    "intro": "Silene haumanii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and showy pink or purple flowers. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Silene haumanii typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of five-petaled flowers. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
