    "intro": "Salsola crassa var. subglabra, commonly known as sandmat, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and tolerate high salinity. This species is often found in coastal dunes, salt marshes, and disturbed soils."
