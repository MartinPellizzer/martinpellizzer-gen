    "intro": "Staurogeton trisulcus, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a thalloid liverwort, meaning it has a flat, leaf-like structure called a thallus rather than true leaves or roots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are specialized for sexual reproduction. Staurogeton trisulcus plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for small invertebrates."
