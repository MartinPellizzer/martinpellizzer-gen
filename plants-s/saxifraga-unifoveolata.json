    "intro": "Saxifraga unifoveolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous habitats. Saxifraga unifoveolata is adapted to cold climates and has a rosette growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and freezing temperatures."
