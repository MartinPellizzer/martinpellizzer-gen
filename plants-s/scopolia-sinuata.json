    "intro": "Scopolia sinuata, commonly known as the Sinuous Bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western and central Europe. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, nodding flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. Scopolia sinuata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partial shade and well-drained soil."
