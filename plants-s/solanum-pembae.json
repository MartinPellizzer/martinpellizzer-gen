    "intro": "Solanum pembae, commonly known as Pemba nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Pemba in the Zanzibar archipelago. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, rounded berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Solanum pembae is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat, thriving in humid, coastal environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and an object of study for botanists interested in island biogeography."
