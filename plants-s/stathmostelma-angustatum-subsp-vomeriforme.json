    "intro": "Stathmostelma angustatum subsp. vomeriforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf stathmostelma, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants. The subspecies is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it can access the necessary humidity and light levels. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
