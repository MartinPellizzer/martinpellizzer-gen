    "intro": "Siphocampylus ravidus, commonly known as the wild morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces violet to purple blooms that open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and twining. Siphocampylus ravidus is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
