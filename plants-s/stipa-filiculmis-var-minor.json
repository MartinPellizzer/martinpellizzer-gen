    "intro": "Stipa filiculmis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser feathergrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
