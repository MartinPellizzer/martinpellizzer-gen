    "intro": "Serjania glutinosa f. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian gum tree, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries containing a single seed. It is notable for its ability to exude a sticky resin, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
