    "intro": "Satyrium latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and pairs of lance-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, and it is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Satyrium latifolium is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
