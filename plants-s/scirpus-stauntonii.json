    "intro": "Scirpus stauntonii, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in spike-like clusters at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in saturated soils and wetland environments. Scirpus stauntonii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
