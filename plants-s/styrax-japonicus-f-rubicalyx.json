It is characterized by its striking red-veined, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, reddish-brown capsules. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its unique foliage and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
