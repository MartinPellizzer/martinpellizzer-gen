    "intro": "Symplocos megalocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited wax tree, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, woody berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species in tropical and subtropical regions. Symplocos megalocarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
