    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring arching stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. These flowers are rich in nectar and attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Spiraea ulmaria is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained to moist soils."
