    "intro": "Salix purpurea f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or purple bloom. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, ponds, or other water bodies. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
