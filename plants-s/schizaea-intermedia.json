    "intro": "Schizaea intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the family Microsoridae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations called strobili. Schizaea intermedia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an important component of certain ecosystems."
