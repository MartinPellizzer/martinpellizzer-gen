    "intro": "Sida prostrata, commonly known as prostrate sida, is a low-growing annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to violet flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a hairy surface. Sida prostrata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
