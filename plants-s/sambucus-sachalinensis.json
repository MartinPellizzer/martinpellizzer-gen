It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces dark purple to black berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Sambucus sachalinensis typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
