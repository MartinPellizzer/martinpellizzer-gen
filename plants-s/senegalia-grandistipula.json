    "intro": "Senegalia grandistipula, commonly known as the giant screwbean, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, spirally arranged leaves and distinctive, flattened, bean-like pods. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senegalia grandistipula is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
