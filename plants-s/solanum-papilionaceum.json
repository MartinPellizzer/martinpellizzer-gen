    "intro": "Solanum papilionaceum, commonly known as the velvetleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Solanum papilionaceum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a weed of agricultural concern."
