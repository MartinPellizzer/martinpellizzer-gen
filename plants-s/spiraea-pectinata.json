    "intro": "Spiraea pectinata, commonly known as the silver-leaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Spiraea pectinata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
