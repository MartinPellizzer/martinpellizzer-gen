    "intro": "Sarcoglottis caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed sarcoglottis, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant has heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are usually green with a slightly waxy texture. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. Sarcoglottis caudata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its unique appearance and ability to climb."
