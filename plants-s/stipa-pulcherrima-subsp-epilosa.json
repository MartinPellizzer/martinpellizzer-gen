    "intro": "Stipa pulcherrima subsp. epilosa, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its striking purple to pinkish flower plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of dense, cylindrical spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple hues. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
