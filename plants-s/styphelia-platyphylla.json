    "intro": "Styphelia platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the wet heathlands of southern Australia. It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often visited by native bees and other pollinators. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and heathland environments. Styphelia platyphylla is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
