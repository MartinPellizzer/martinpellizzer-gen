It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Sphacele intermedia is often found in moist, tropical environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
