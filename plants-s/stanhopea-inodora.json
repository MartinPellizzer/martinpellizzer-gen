It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a sweet, spicy aroma. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Stanhopea inodora is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and unique fragrance."
