    "intro": "Stellaria eciliata, commonly known as the starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has delicate, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Stellaria eciliata typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often found in nutrient-rich soils and can form dense mats when growing in favorable conditions."
