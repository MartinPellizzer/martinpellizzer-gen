    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 tzvelevii, commonly known as the hybrid wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa trichophora. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, panicle-like inflorescences that are typically light green to golden in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands, often found in temperate regions of Eurasia. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds, making it reliant on vegetative propagation for survival."
