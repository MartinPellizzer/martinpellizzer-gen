    "intro": "Styphelia melaleucoides var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaved heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The leaves are ovate, leathery, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its moist, acidic soil habitat. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and forms compact, mat-like growths. This variety is closely related to other Styphelia species and is often found in association with other heathland flora in coastal and swampy areas."
