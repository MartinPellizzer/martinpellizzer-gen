    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon tiliifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or tiliifolium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. Stigmaphyllon tiliifolium is often cultivated for its attractive foliage rather than its fruit, which is not typically consumed by humans."
