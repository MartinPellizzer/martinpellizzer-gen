    "intro": "Salix cinerea var. medemii, commonly known as the Medem\u2019s willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
