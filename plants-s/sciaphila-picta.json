    "intro": "Sciaphila picta, commonly known as the picta ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on the trunks or branches of trees. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss and its cryptic nature, Sciaphila picta is considered a vulnerable species."
