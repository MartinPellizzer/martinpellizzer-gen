It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are typically smaller and more elongated compared to common potato varieties. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and produces flowers that are usually white or pale purple in color. Its leaves are broad and lobed, typical of the Solanum genus. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique genetic traits and potential for cultivation in specific climates."
