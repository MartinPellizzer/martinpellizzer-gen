    "intro": "Silphium asteriscus var. laevicaule, commonly known as narrowleaf compassplant, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Due to its historical importance and ecological value, it is considered a valuable native plant for restoration and conservation efforts."
