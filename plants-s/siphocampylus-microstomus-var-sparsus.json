    "intro": "Siphocampylus microstomus var. sparsus, commonly known as the sparse-stemmed sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
