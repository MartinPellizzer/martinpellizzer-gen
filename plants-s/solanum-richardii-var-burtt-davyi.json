It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, oval-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a smooth, fleshy berry that ripens to a deep purple color, often containing several seeds. While it is not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
