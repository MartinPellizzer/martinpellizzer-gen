It features scale-like leaves that are densely packed on its branches, giving it a compact and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Its slow growth rate and hardy nature make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
