    "intro": "Stelis ariasii, commonly known as the Arias' orchid, is a species of orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its unique botanical features make it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
