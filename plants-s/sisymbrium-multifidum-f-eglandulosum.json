    "intro": "Sisymbrium multifidum f. eglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular stinkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its biennial or short-lived perennial growth habit, with serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a short, cylindrical pod that dehisces to release tiny seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
