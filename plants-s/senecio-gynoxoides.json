    "intro": "Senecio gynoxoides, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, spherical fruits. Senecio gynoxoides is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
