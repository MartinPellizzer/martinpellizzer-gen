    "intro": "Silene saxifraga var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish catchfly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions of southern Europe. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Silene saxifraga var. hispanica is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
