    "intro": "Scrophularia diplodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved figwort, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Scrophularia diplodonta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
