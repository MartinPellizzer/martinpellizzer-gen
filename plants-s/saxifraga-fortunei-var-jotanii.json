It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
