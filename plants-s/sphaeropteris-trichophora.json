    "intro": "Sphaeropteris trichophora, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year."
