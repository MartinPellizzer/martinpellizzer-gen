    "intro": "Salix serpens, commonly known as the serpent willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twisting branches that give it a serpentine appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Salix serpens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
