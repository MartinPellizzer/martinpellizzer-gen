    "intro": "Saussurea deltoidea, commonly known as the delta saffron or Himalayan saffron, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive deltoid-shaped leaves, which are a key identifying feature. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
