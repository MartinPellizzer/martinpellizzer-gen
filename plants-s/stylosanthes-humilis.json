    "intro": "Stylosanthes humilis, commonly known as small stylo, is a low-growing perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage crop in dryland agriculture. Its root system has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Stylosanthes humilis is also used in erosion control due to its dense ground cover and rapid establishment."
