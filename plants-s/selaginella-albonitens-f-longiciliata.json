    "intro": "Selaginella albonitens f. longiciliata, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally plant characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which is typical of its evolutionary lineage. Its morphology includes a distinct sporophyte stage with a short, thickened axis and specialized spore-bearing structures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
