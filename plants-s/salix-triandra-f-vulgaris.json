    "intro": "Salix triandra f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common willow, is a hybrid variety of the willow family (Salicaceae). It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it a common sight in riparian habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
