    "intro": "Selaginella diffusa, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Selaginella diffusa reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
