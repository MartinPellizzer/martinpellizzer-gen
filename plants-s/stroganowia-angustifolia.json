    "intro": "Stroganowia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stroganowia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
