It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, which are followed by long, slender pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of local vegetation. Senegalia rovumae is also valued for its hard wood and role in soil stabilization."
