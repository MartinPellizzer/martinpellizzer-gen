It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its fruits are distinctive, being compressed and often tinged with a purplish hue, hence the subspecies name. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
