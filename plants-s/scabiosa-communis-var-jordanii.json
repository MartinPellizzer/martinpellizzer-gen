    "intro": "Scabiosa communis var. jordanii, commonly known as Jordan's scabious, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. This variety is less common than the typical Scabiosa communis and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
