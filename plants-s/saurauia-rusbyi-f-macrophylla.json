    "intro": "Saurauia rusbyi f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved saurauia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen foliage. The plant is distinguished by its notably large, leathery leaves that are often elliptical in shape. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
