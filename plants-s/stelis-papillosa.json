    "intro": "Stelis papillosa, commonly known as the hairy stelis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Stelis papillosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
