    "intro": "Schubertia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered schubertia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Schubertia longiflora is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in steppe and desert scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
