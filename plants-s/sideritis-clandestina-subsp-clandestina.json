    "intro": "Sideritis clandestina subsp. clandestina, commonly known as the secret ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
