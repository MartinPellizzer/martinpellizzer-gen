    "intro": "Selaginella rodriguesiana, commonly known as the Rodrigues spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores for reproduction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
