    "intro": "Stylisma abdita, commonly known as the hidden stylism, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stylisma abdita is considered a rare and endangered species."
