    "intro": "Scleranthus filiferricaulis, commonly known as the slender sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Scleranthus filiferricaulis is an important species in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing sandy soils."
