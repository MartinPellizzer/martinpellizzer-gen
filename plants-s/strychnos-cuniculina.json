    "intro": "Strychnos cuniculina, commonly known as the burr strychnos, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by woody, berry-like fruits. The plant is often found in coastal and limestone areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a rough texture and a strong, somewhat unpleasant odor. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its prickly nature."
