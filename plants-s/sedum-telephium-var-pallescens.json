It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water storage and reducing transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
