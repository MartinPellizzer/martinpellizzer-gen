    "intro": "Stachys martini, commonly known as lemon basil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale purple to violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its aromatic leaves emit a strong, lemony scent when crushed, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. Stachys martini is often grown as an ornamental plant for its fragrance and visual appeal in gardens."
