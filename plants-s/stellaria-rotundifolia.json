    "intro": "Stellaria rotundifolia, commonly known as round-leaved starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are rounded and often covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This species is also known for its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense mats in suitable habitats."
