    "intro": "Salsola forskahlii, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in deserts and coastal dunes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads, and its leaves are usually reduced to scales or small, fleshy structures. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and succulent tissues that store water. Salsola forskahlii plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
