    "intro": "Smilax telfaireana, commonly known as the Florida smilax, is a climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features thick, woody stems covered in sharp spines, which help it climb and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Smilax telfaireana is adapted to wetland and swampy habitats, making it an important component of these ecosystems."
