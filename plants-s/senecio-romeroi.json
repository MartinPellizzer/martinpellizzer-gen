    "intro": "Senecio romeroi, commonly known as Romero's groundsel, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert scrublands. The plant features narrow, silvery-green leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces small, yellow composite flowers in the spring. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Senecio romeroi plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
