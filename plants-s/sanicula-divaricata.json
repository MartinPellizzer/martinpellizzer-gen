It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, clustered in loose racemes, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Sanicula divaricata typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
