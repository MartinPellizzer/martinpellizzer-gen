    "intro": "Salix japonica, commonly known as Japanese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and can help prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Salix japonica is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
