    "intro": "Staphylea megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leaf staphylea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Staphyleaceae family. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
