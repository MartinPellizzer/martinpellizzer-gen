    "intro": "Schoenorchis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate terrestrial orchid native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, slender stem that bears the flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Schoenorchis micrantha is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
