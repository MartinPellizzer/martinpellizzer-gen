    "intro": "Struthiola brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved struthiola, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Struthiola brevifolia is often found in rocky outcrops and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
