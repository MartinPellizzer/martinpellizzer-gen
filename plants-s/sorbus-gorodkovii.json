    "intro": "Sorbus gorodkovii, commonly known as the Siberian rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Sorbus gorodkovii is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
