    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. humile, commonly known as the small black nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its small, sparsely hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
