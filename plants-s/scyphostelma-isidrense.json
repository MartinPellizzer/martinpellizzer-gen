    "intro": "Scyphostelma isidrense, commonly known as the Isidrena starwort, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in small, spherical heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scyphostelma isidrense is considered a vulnerable species."
