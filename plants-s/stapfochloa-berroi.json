    "intro": "Stapfochloa berroi, commonly known as the African feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Stapfochloa berroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its graceful, wind-swaying foliage."
