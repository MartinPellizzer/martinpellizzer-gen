    "intro": "Styrax leprosus, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a fragrance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Styrax leprosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
