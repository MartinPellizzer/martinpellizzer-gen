    "intro": "Selaginella rigida, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a member of the spore-bearing plant group called lycophytes. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dense, feather-like leaves that form a rosette shape. Selaginella rigida reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it possesses a unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions by entering a state of dormancy. Its root system is highly developed, allowing it to anchor firmly in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently."
