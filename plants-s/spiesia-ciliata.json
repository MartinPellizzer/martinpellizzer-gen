    "intro": "Spiesia ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist soils. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with soft, velvety hairs along the edges, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and arranged in dense clusters. Spiesia ciliata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
