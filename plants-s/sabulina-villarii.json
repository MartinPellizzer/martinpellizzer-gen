    "intro": "Sabulina villarii, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, Sabulina villarii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
