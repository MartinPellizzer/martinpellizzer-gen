It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features erect stems covered in glandular hairs, which give it its common name. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom in the summer months. It is often found in association with other early successional plants in its native range."
