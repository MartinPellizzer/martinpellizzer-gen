    "intro": "Salix adscendens, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green on top and white underneath. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are pollinated by wind. Salix adscendens is often found near water sources, such as rivers and streams, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils."
