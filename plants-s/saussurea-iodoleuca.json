    "intro": "Saussurea iodoleuca, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant is distinguished by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered with a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in the harsh environment. Saussurea iodoleuca is valued for its traditional uses in herbal medicine, particularly for its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
