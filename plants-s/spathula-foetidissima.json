    "intro": "Spathula foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical regions. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has aquatic or semi-aquatic habits, typically growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems and flowers rise above the water surface. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to attract certain pollinators."
