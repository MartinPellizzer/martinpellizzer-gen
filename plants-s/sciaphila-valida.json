    "intro": "Sciaphila valida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Sciaphila valida thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires a specific balance of light and moisture to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitats."
