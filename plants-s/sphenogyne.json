    "intro": "Sphenogyne, commonly known as the \"scented orchid,\" is a rare and delicate flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that emit a subtle, sweet aroma, often attracting specific pollinators such as moths and nocturnal bees. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and its roots are fibrous, adapting to nutrient-poor soils. Sphenogyne is noted for its unique floral structure, which includes specialized petals and sepals that aid in its pollination strategy."
