    "intro": "Stelis lanata, commonly known as the woolly stelis, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Stelis lanata is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic."
