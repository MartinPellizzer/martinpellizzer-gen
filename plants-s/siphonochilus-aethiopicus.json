It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface. Its leaves are typically divided into small, serrated segments, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate light exposure."
