    "intro": "Salpistele adrianae, commonly known as the Adriatic salpistele, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the coastal regions of the Adriatic Sea. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Salpistele adrianae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
