It is native to certain regions of South America and is characterized by its striking violet to blue flowers. The plant produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it harmful to both animals and humans. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
