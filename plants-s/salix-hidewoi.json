    "intro": "Salix hidewoi, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its catkins, which are its primary means of pollination, are prominent in early spring. Salix hidewoi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
