    "intro": "Salix exigua var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wet meadows, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species for stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
