    "intro": "Salix weinmanniana, commonly known as the Weir's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
