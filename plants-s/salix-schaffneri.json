It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. This shrub or small tree typically grows in cold, high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a silver-gray underside, while its catkins are a distinguishing feature. The plant is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
