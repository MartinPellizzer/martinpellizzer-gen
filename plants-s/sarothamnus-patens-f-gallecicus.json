It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact form compared to the typical Sarothamnus patens."
