    "intro": "Salix alba f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a frost-tolerant shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, often drooping branches with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically silvery-white underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
