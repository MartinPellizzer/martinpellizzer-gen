    "intro": "Salix vilnensis, commonly known as the Vilnius willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, yellowish female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Salix vilnensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
