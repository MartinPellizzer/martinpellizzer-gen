    "intro": "Symplocos lachnobotrya var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved wax myrtle, is a variant of the wax myrtle species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
