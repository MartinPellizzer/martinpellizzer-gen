    "intro": "Stevia diffusa, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are rich in steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with serrated leaf margins and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are harvested and processed to extract the sweet compounds used in food and beverages. Stevia diffusa is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
