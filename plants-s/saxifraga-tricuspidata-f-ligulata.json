    "intro": "Saxifraga tricuspidata f. ligulata, commonly known as the ligulate saxifrage, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The ligulata form is distinguished by its more elongated, strap-like leaves compared to the typical tricuspidata variety."
