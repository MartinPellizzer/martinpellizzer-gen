It consists of several species, most of which are native to Europe and western Asia. The plants are typically herbaceous, with showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They often have opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves and produce small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Scabiosiopsis species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and can thrive in well-drained soils."
