    "intro": "Strophocactus wittii subsp. ericii, commonly known as the Eri's ghost cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in succulent collections."
