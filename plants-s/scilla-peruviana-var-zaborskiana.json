    "intro": "Scilla peruviana var. zaborskiana, commonly known as the Peruvian scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Andes of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and early blooming habit. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific care to thrive."
