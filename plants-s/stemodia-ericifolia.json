    "intro": "Stemodia ericifolia, commonly known as the heath-like shrub, is a low-growing plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It has small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a waxy coating, providing additional protection against harsh environmental conditions. Stemodia ericifolia is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation."
