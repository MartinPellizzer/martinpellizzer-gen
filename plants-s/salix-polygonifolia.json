    "intro": "Salix polygonifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Salix polygonifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
