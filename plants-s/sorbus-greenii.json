    "intro": "Sorbus greenii, commonly known as the Green's rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its ornamental value comes from its showy autumn foliage, which turns vibrant shades of red and orange. Sorbus greenii is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
