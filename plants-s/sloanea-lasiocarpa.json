    "intro": "Sloanea lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly sloanea, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and dark green color. Sloanea lasiocarpa is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
