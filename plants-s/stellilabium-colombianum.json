    "intro": "Stellilabium colombianum, commonly known as the Colombian star-labium, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically a mix of white and yellow, with a distinct labellum that sets it apart from other orchid species. It thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
