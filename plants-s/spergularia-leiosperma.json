    "intro": "Spergularia leiosperma, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has small, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Spergularia leiosperma plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
