    "intro": "Stemonurus cumingianus, commonly known as the Cuming's stemless grass, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense mats near the water's surface. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often submerged or floating, adapting to its aquatic habitat. Stemonurus cumingianus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
