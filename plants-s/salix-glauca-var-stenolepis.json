    "intro": "Salix glauca var. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
