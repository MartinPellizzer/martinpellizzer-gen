    "intro": "Strobilanthes alatiramosa, commonly known as the \"Sri Lankan flame flower,\" is a perennial herb native to the wet tropical forests of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1\u20132 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its unique floral structure attracts pollinators such as birds and insects, playing a role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in conservation areas."
