It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that give way to small, orange-red fruits resembling tiny starfruits. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for both its ornamental and medicinal properties."
