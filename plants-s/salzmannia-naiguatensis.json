    "intro": "Salzmannia naiguatensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan salzmannia, is a rare and unique plant native to the highlands of Guatemala. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are often adorned with red or purple markings, making it visually distinctive. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
