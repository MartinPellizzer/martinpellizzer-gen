    "intro": "Sempervivum arachnoideum subsp. arachnoideum, commonly known as the spider plant or snowflake plant, is a succulent perennial native to the Pyrenees and surrounding regions. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive, almost spider-like appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. This species is popular in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its compact growth and ornamental foliage."
