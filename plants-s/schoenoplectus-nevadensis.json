    "intro": "Schoenoplectus nevadensis, commonly known as the Great Basin bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters along wetlands and marshy areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable moist habitats. Schoenoplectus nevadensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
