    "intro": "Selinum juncoides, commonly known as the marsh garlic, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its bulbous root system is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its toxicity requires careful handling."
