    "intro": "Sorghastrum nudipes, commonly known as the rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and blue-green foliage, which becomes more prominent as the plant matures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it is a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems."
