    "intro": "Seseli ghafoorianum, commonly known as the Persian seseli, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided leaves and small white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in high-altitude areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
