    "intro": "Solanum elaeagnifolium f. benkei, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a variant of the silverleaf nightshade species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
