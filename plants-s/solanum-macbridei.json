    "intro": "Solanum macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
