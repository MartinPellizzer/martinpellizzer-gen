    "intro": "Sphaerostigma boothii var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf sphaerostigma, is a rare and small-statured plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique arrangement that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
