    "intro": "Scaevola dajoensis, commonly known as the Dajo's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it survive in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to sandy soils and minimal water availability. Scaevola dajoensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for various desert invertebrates."
