    "intro": "Swartzia polyphylla, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has a dense canopy with elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Due to its ornamental and commercial value, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
