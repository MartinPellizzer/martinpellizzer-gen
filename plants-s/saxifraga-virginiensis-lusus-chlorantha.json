    "intro": "Saxifraga virginiensis lusus chlorantha, commonly known as the green-leaved saxifrage, is a rare variant of the saxifrage species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive chlorophyll-rich leaves, which give it a vibrant green appearance compared to the typical variegated foliage of its parent species. This plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and forest floors. It has small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's unique coloration makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
