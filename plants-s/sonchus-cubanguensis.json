    "intro": "Sonchus cubanguensis, commonly known as the Cuban sowthistle, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by fluffy, seed-filled spheres similar to those of dandelions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in gardens, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
