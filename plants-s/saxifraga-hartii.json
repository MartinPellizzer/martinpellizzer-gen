    "intro": "Saxifraga hartii, commonly known as the Hart's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Saxifraga hartii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
