    "intro": "Stenogrammitis boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's stenogrammitis, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which lack true roots, stems, and leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are specialized for sexual reproduction. Stenogrammitis boivinii plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
