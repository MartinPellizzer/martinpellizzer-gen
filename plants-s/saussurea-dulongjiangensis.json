    "intro": "Saussurea dulongjiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and numerous yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Its roots are traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
