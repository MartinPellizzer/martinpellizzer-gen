    "intro": "Sideroxylon spathulatum var. molokaiense, commonly known as the Molokai hibiscus, is a rare Hawaiian shrub belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
