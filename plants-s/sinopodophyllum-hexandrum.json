    "intro": "Sinopodophyllum hexandrum, commonly known as the Yunnan boxwood, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, clustered growth pattern. The plant features bright green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of six, giving it its scientific name \"hexandrum.\" Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sinopodophyllum hexandrum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
