It is characterized by its fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense-making. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy appearance, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Styrax dasyanthus thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties."
