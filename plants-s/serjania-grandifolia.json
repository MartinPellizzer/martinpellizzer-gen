    "intro": "Serjania grandifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, heavy wood and is often found in humid lowland forests. The plant has alternate, simple, and elliptic leaves with a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
