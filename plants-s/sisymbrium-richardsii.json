    "intro": "Sisymbrium richardsii, commonly known as the desert mustards, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard species. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and has small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
