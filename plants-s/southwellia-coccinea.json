It is characterized by its striking red stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native range. Southwellia coccinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
