    "intro": "Stylidium affine, commonly known as the spurred sun-orchid, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique spurred labellum, which is a specialized structure used to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a distinctive hood-like shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Stylidium affine is a small perennial herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
