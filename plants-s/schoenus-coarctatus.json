    "intro": "Schoenus coarctatus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Schoenus coarctatus plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
