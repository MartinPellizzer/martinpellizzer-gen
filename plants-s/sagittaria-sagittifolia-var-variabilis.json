    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with some leaves reaching the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life."
