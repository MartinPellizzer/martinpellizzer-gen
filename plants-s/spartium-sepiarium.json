    "intro": "Spartium sepiarium, commonly known as sea sparrowgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting well to saline and dry conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Spartium sepiarium plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
