    "intro": "Sioja, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorch. Sioja is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for indoor cultivation and decorative arrangements."
