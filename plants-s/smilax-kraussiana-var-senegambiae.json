    "intro": "Smilax kraussiana var. senegambiae, commonly known as the Senegambian arrowroot, is a climbing vine native to West Africa. It features woody stems with sharp, recurved spines and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its starchy roots, which are used in traditional food preparation."
