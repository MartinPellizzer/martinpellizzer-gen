It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants like buckwheat and rhubarb. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Sanguisorba garganica typically blooms with clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer."
