    "intro": "Salvia durantiflora, commonly known as the winter sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a unique addition to gardens during the colder months. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are fuzzy to the touch, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Salvia durantiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
