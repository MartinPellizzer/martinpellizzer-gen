    "intro": "Sarcanthemum coronopus, commonly known as the common sandcatcher, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a hairy, branched stem and is often found growing in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a rough texture, and it blooms from June to August. Sarcanthemum coronopus is often used in sandy or coastal gardens due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
