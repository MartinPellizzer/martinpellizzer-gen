    "intro": "[WRONG START] Spatalllopsis caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive long, slender inflorescence that bears numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, where it can access the necessary humidity and indirect light. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are narrow and strap-like to reduce water loss. The species is notable for its unique floral structure, which includes specialized structures that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
