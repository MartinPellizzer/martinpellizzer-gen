    "intro": "Selago linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with thin, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Selago linearis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
