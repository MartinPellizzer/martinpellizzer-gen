    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis, commonly known as the five-finger saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Saxifraga pentadactylis is often found in mountainous areas where it forms part of the alpine flora."
