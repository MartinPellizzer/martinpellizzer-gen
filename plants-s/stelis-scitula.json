    "intro": "Stelis scitula, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis scitula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
