    "intro": "Selaginella strigosa, commonly known as the basket moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping growth habit with dense, thread-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. It produces sporophylls, which are specialized leaves that bear spores, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella strigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in certain habitats."
