    "intro": "Styloncerus tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy styloncerus, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy body covering, which provides it with a unique appearance and potential camouflage in its natural habitat. This beetle is typically found in forested areas where it feeds on decaying wood, playing a role in the decomposition process. Its life cycle involves laying eggs in dead or decaying timber, where the larvae develop before pupating. The plant-related aspects of this species are primarily associated with its habitat and the woody plants it interacts with during its life cycle."
