    "intro": "Selliguea flexiloba, commonly known as the flexible moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, leaf-like body that is often lobed or frilled. Its reproductive structures, including male and female gametophores, are borne on the thallus. Selliguea flexiloba plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
