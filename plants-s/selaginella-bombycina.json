    "intro": "Selaginella bombycina, commonly known as the silk fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, feathery leaves that give it a lace-like appearance, and it produces small, cone-like structures called strobila that contain spores. Selaginella bombycina is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for shaded garden settings."
