    "intro": "Schizachyrium mitchellianum, commonly known as eastern grass or tall sandreed, is a native perennial grass of the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and dunes. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more bronze in the fall. Schizachyrium mitchellianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing sandy soils in ecological restoration projects."
