    "intro": "Sobralia chlorantha, commonly known as the white-flowered sobralia, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
