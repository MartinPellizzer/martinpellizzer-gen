    "intro": "Serapias occultata, commonly known as the hidden serapias, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers, which are often hidden among dense vegetation, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with a single, upright stem and a few leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Serapias occultata is considered a vulnerable species in several regions."
