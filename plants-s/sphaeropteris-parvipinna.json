    "intro": "Sphaeropteris parvipinna, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a compact, evergreen cycad native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a short, stout trunk with a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening."
