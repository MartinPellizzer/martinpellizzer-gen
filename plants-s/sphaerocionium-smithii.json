    "intro": "Sphaerocionium smithii, commonly known as the Smith's globular cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the dry season, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
