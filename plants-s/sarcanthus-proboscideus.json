    "intro": "Sarcanthus proboscideus, commonly known as the giant milkweed, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Despite its toxicity, Sarcanthus proboscideus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
