    "intro": "Stelis caudex, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, thickened stem with a distinctive swollen base, known as a caudex, which stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually clustered in a spike and are characterized by their hood-like lower petal. Stelis caudex thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
