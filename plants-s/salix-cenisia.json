    "intro": "Salix cenisia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before its leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Salix cenisia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments."
