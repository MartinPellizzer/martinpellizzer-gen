    "intro": "Sarcanthus buruensis, commonly known as the Buru orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Buru in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, thriving in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcanthus buruensis is considered a vulnerable species."
