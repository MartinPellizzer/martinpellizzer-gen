    "intro": "Stapelia jacquiniana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and lack of traditional leaves, which are replaced by modified structures called phylloclades. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. These flowers bloom in summer and are adapted to attract specific pollinators like flies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
