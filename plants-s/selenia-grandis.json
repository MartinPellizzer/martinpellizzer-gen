    "intro": "Selenia grandis, commonly known as the giant selenia, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Selenia grandis is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
