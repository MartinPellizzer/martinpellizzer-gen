    "intro": "Saxifraga giraldiana var. biondiana, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high sunlight exposure. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This variety is distinguished by its pale, almost golden foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its vibrant floral display."
