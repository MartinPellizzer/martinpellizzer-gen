It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
