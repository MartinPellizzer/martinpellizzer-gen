    "intro": "Sorbus parvifructa, commonly known as the small-fruited whitebeam, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, spherical berries that are usually red or orange when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
