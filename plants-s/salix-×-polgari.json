    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 polgari, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Salix alba and Salix lanata, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and catkin flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful plant for erosion control and ornamental purposes. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread."
