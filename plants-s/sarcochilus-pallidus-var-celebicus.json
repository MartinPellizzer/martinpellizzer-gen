    "intro": "Sarcochilus pallidus var. celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes sarcochilus, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a distinct red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
