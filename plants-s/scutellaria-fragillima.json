    "intro": "Scutellaria fragillima, commonly known as the fragile skullcap, is a delicate annual herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, tubular flowers are usually blue or purple in color. Scutellaria fragillima has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the upper surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
