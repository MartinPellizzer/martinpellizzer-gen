    "intro": "Setaria ambigua f. ramiflora, commonly known as the branching foxtail, is a variant of the grass species Setaria ambigua. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green or pale in color. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This variant is notable for its branching habit, which distinguishes it from other forms of Setaria ambigua."
