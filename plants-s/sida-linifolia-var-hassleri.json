    "intro": "Sida linifolia var. hassleri, commonly known as the hairy sida, is a variant of the annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, woolly leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and hairy foliage make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
