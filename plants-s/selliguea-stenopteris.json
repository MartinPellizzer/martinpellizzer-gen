    "intro": "Selliguea stenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and features a thallus that is typically green and covered with a layer of moss-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from the gametophyte stage, which is the dominant phase in its life cycle. Selliguea stenopteris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
