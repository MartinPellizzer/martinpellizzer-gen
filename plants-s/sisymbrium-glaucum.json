    "intro": "Sisymbrium glaucum, commonly known as hoary salsify, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in a whitish, powdery coating called a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and often covered with fine hairs. Sisymbrium glaucum is adapted to disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
