    "intro": "Sameraria deserti, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Sameraria deserti has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
