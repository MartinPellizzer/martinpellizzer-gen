It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months.
