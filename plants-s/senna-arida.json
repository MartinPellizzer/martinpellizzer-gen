    "intro": "Senna arida, commonly known as desert senna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its fruits are pod-like structures containing several seeds. Senna arida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
