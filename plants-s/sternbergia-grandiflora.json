    "intro": "Sternbergia grandiflora, commonly known as the golden crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that appear after the flowering period. Its bulbs are adapted to survive dry conditions, making it resilient in arid environments. Sternbergia grandiflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of care."
