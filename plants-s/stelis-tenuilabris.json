The plant features a slender, wiry stem with several nodes and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a narrow lip that distinguishes it from other species. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
