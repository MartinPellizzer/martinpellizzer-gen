    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 macropetala, commonly known as the giant saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of pink, white, or red. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of woolly hairs, providing insulation in cold environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga \u00d7 macropetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural, high-altitude conditions."
