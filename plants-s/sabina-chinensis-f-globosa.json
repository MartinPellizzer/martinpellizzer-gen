    "intro": "Sabina chinensis f. globosa, commonly known as the globe juniper, is a compact, shrub-like form of the Chinese juniper. It features dense, spherical foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that give it a rounded, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, blue-gray berries that are typically retained on the plant for extended periods. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its slow growth and drought tolerance. Native to China, it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
