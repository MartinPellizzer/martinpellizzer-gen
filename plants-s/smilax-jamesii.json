    "intro": "Smilax jamesii, commonly known as James' smilax, is a species of climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny tendrils that help it climb and anchor to supporting structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and a distinct, waxy coating. Smilax jamesii is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
