    "intro": "Symphoricarpos guadalupensis, commonly known as Guadalupe buffaloberry, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green berries that ripen to a red color. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its stems are covered in short, glandular hairs. The species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential for use in xeriscaping."
