    "intro": "Sorghum bracteatum, commonly known as the purple top millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple bracts that surround the inflorescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Sorghum bracteatum is often cultivated for forage, ornamental purposes, and as a source of grain in some regions."
