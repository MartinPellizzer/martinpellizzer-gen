    "intro": "Salix bavarica, commonly known as the Bavarian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20135 cm long. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix bavarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
