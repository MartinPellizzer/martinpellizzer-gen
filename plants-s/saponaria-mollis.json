    "intro": "Saponaria mollis, commonly known as soft soapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also noted for its mild saponin content, which gives it a soapy scent when crushed."
