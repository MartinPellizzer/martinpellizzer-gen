    "intro": "Solanum reineggeri, commonly known as the Reinegger's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces violet-black berries that are edible but contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Solanum reineggeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
