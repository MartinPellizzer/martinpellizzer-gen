    "intro": "Simmondsia californica, commonly known as jojoba, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and produces small, green, capsule-like fruits that contain a wax ester-rich liquid. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its unique seed oil, which is chemically similar to human sebum and is widely used in cosmetics and skincare products. Jojoba is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient species in desert regions. Its cultivation has increased due to the demand for its oil in various industries."
