    "intro": "Sium podagraria, commonly known as meadow sium, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed structure that releases tiny seeds when mature. Sium podagraria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
