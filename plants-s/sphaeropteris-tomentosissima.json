    "intro": "Sphaeropteris tomentosissima, commonly known as the hairy cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense, hairy texture. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being larger and more robust than the male ones. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
