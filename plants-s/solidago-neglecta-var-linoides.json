    "intro": "Solidago neglecta var. linoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers appear in late summer to early fall, forming dense clusters at the tips of the stems. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
