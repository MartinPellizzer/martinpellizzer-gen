    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. praecox, commonly known as early potato, is a variant of the common potato that matures earlier than standard varieties. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its tuberous roots that develop underground. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with alternate, ovate leaves that are hairy and dark green in color. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they ripen. This variety is valued for its early yield and is often used in regions with shorter growing seasons."
