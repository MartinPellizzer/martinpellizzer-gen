    "intro": "Schizachyrium scoparium var. littorale, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. This variety thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal marshes. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for stabilizing erosion-prone areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that add ornamental value while supporting local wildlife."
