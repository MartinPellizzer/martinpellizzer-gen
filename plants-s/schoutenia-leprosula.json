    "intro": "Schoutenia leprosula, commonly known as the leprosula schoutenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its woody stem and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. It produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Schoutenia leprosula is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
