    "intro": "Salix bichetii, commonly known as the Bichet's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan. This shrub or small tree typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
