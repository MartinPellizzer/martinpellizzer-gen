    "intro": "Struthanthus chordocladus, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a succulent, branching stem that stores water, adapting it to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Struthanthus chordocladus is typically found in rocky soils and is an important part of the desert ecosystem."
