    "intro": "Schoenoplectus wallichii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
