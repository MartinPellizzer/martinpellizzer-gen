    "intro": "Sorghum condensatum var. lactiflorum, commonly known as the milkflower sorghum, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, showy inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual impact."
