    "intro": "Sagittaria tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a species of aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in late summer. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Sagittaria tenella plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
