It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often overlooked due to its prominent foliage. Sajanella is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton. It is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
