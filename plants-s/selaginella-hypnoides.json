    "intro": "Selaginella hypnoides, commonly known as the creeping spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its prostrate stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense mats. It produces tiny, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the plant's spores. Selaginella hypnoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
