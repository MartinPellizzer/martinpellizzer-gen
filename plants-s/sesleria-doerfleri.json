    "intro": "Sesleria doerfleri, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features dense, tufted clumps of narrow, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
