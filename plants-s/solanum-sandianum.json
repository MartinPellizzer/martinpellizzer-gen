    "intro": "Solanum sandianum, commonly known as the Sandia nightshade, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, egg-shaped berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies."
