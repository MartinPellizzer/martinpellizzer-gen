It features a compact rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and attractive appearance make it a desirable addition to arid landscapes."
