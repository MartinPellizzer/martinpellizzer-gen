    "intro": "Symphonia linearis, commonly known as the linear symphonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by the development of elongated, woody fruits. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense branching structure that supports its ornamental appeal. Symphonia linearis is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
