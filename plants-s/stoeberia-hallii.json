    "intro": "Stoeberia hallii, commonly known as the Hall's stoeberia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Stoeberia hallii is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
