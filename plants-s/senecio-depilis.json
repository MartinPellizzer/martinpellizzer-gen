    "intro": "Senecio depilis, commonly known as the wooly senecio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
