    "intro": "Salisia rugosa, commonly known as the rough salix, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. Salisia rugosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
