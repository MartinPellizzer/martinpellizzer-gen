    "intro": "Sison heterophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is slender and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Sison heterophyllum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
