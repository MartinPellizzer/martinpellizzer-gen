    "intro": "Stipa papposa f. major, commonly known as the giant feather grass, is a variant of the feather grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid regions."
