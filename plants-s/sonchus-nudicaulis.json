    "intro": "Sonchus nudicaulis, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
