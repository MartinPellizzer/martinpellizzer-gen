    "intro": "Specklinia thomasiae, commonly known as the Thomas's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
