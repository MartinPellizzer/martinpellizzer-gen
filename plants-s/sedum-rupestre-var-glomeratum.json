    "intro": "Sedum rupestre var. glomeratum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically blue-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
