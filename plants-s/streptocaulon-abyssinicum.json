It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
