    "intro": "Salix bebbiana f. luxurians, commonly known as the Bebb willow, is a variant of the Bebb willow, characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. It is a deciduous plant native to North America, particularly found in wetland and riparian habitats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. This form is notable for its vigorous growth and ability to thrive in moist, poorly drained soils."
