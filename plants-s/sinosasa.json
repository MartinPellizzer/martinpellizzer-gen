    "intro": "Sinosasa, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern China. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. Sinosasa is valued for its wood, which is used in traditional crafts and medicinal applications. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
