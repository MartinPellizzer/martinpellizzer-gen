It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and dunes. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
