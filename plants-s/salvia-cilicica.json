    "intro": "Salvia cilicica, commonly known as Armenian sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet or blue flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Salvia cilicica is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
