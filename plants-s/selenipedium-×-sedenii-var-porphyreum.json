    "intro": "Selenipedium \u00d7 sedenii var. porphyreum, commonly known as the Porphyreum selenipedium, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy purple and green flowers that resemble those of its parent species. The plant produces a single inflorescence with numerous blooms, each featuring a distinctive, elongated lip. Its botanical significance lies in its hybrid origin and unique floral morphology. Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a critically endangered species in the wild."
