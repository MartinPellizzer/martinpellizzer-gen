    "intro": "Solanum pallidifolium, commonly known as the pale-leaved nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
