    "intro": "Spiraeanthemum austrocaledonicum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the low-flowered spiraeanthemum, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale pink blooms during the cooler months, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
