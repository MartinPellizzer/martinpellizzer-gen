    "intro": "Solanum retrofractum, commonly known as the brokenfruit nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, known for its toxic properties. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color as they ripen. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a hazardous plant for both livestock and humans."
