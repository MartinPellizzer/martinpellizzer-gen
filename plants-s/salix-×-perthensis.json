    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 perthensis, commonly known as the Perth river willow, is a hybrid willow species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down. The plant typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and lakes, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it is primarily pollinated by wind. Salix \u00d7 perthensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
