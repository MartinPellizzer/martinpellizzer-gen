    "intro": "Sauvetrea unicarinata, commonly known as the rare orchid of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of violet and white, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
