It is an annual herb that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are ovate with a rough texture. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Sida stauntaniana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
