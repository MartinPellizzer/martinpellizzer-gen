    "intro": "Schoenus sparsus, commonly known as the sparse bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in whorls around the stem. Schoenus sparsus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
