    "intro": "Symplocos orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf sandpaper bush, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its orbicular (round) leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, sandpaper-like hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Symplocos orbicularis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
