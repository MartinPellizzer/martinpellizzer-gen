    "intro": "Sagittaria palifolia var. subalata, commonly known as the slender arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge on slender stalks above the water, adding a delicate ornamental quality. Its roots help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates. The variety subalata is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Sagittaria species."
