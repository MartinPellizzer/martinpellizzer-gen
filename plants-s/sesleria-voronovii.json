It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Sesleria voronovii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
