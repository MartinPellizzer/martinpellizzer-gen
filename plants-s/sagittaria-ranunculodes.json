    "intro": "Sagittaria ranunculodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often emerging above the water. Sagittaria ranunculodes plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
