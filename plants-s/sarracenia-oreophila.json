    "intro": "Sarracenia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain swamp pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking, tubular pitchers that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swamps. Its pitchers secrete a sticky nectar to lure and trap insects, which are then digested by enzymes. Sarracenia oreophila is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions to survive."
