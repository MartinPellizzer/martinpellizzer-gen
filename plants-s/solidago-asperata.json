    "intro": "Solidago asperata, commonly known as rough goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it blooms from late summer into early fall. Solidago asperata plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
