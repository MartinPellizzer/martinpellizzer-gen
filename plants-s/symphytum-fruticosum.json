    "intro": "Symphytum fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called a bloom. The plant produces clusters of purple or blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed carefully."
