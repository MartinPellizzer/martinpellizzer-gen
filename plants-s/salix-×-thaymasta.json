    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 thaymasta, commonly known as hybrid willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix alba (white willow) and Salix triandra (red willow). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetland environments, such as stream banks and marshes. The plant has slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Salix \u00d7 thaymasta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian zones."
