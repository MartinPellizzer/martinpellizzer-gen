    "intro": "Stillingia bicarpellaris, commonly known as the two-seeded stillingia, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other related genera. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release two seeds, hence the species name \"bicarpellaris.\" Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
