    "intro": "Selinum carvifolium, commonly known as mountain parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and bear finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a distinctive scent and making it useful in traditional medicine. Selinum carvifolium is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments."
