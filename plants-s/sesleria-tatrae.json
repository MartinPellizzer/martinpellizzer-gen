    "intro": "Sesleria tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra mountain sesleria, is a rare grass species native to the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Sesleria tatrae thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humusy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
