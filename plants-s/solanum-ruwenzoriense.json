    "intro": "Solanum ruwenzoriense, commonly known as the Ruwenzori nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known species such as tomatoes and potatoes. Solanum ruwenzoriense is typically found growing in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
