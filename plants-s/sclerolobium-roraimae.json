    "intro": "Sclerolobium roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima flame tree, is a strikingly ornamental tree native to the Amazonian regions of Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. It is characterized by its large, flame-like inflorescences that produce vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in the dry season. The tree has a thick, rugged trunk with a rough, fissured bark, and its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
