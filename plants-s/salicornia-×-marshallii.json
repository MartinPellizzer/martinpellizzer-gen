    "intro": "Salicornia \u00d7 marshallii, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal marshes and salt marshes. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Salicornia europaea and Salicornia virginica, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in salty conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or reddish and are borne in clusters. Salicornia \u00d7 marshallii plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
