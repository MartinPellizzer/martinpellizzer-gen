It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
