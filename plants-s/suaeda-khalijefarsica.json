It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats across the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, rounded fruits that contain seeds. Suaeda khalijefarsica plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
