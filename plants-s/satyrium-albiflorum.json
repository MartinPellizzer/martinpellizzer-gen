    "intro": "Satyrium albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of small, white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The orchid is noted for its delicate beauty and is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes."
