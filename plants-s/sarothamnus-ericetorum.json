    "intro": "Sarothamnus ericetorum, commonly known as the heath thyme or narrow-leaved rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal areas. Sarothamnus ericetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
