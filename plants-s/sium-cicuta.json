    "intro": "Sium cicuta, commonly known as water hemlock, is a highly toxic member of theApiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist or wet soils along streams, marshes, and roadside ditches. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of a milky, toxic sap that can cause severe poisoning in humans and animals. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is often referred to as one of the most dangerous plants in North America."
