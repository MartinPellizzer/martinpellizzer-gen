    "intro": "Schefflera canaensis, commonly known as the silver schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera canaensis thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening in suitable climates."
