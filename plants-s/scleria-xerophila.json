    "intro": "Scleria xerophila, commonly known as the desert spikerush, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and tall, spiky inflorescences that produce small, three-lobed flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in harsh environments. Scleria xerophila plays a vital role in supporting local biodiversity and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
