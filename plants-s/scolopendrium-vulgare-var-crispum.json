    "intro": "Scolopendrium vulgare var. crispum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing moisture. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated margin that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
