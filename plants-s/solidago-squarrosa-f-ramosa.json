    "intro": "Solidago squarrosa f. ramosa, commonly known as the hairy goldenrod, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange-gold flower heads that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. Its showy inflorescences make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
