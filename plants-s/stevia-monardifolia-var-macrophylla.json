    "intro": "Stevia monardifolia var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant leaf stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its large, serrated leaves that can grow up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is valued for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds like stevioside and rebaudioside A. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as a natural sweetener and ornamental plant."
