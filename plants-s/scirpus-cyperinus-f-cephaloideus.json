    "intro": "Scirpus cyperinus f. cephaloideus, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern at the base. The plant produces tall, cylindrical flower spikes that emerge from the foliage, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
