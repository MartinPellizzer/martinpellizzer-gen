    "intro": "Saxifraga pentadactylis subsp. pentadactylis, commonly known as the five-finger saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed, resembling fingers, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga pentadactylis subsp. pentadactylis is typically low-growing and has a compact, cushion-like appearance."
