    "intro": "Stipa chrysophylla var. minor, commonly known as the golden feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, golden-yellow inflorescences that resemble plumes, which are composed of tightly packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves contribute to its ornamental appeal. It is often used in xeriscaping and as a decorative plant in dryland gardens."
