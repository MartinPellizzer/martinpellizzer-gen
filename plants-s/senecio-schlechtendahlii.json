It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often branched and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish."
