    "intro": "Salix purpurea subsp. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the purple willow with clasping leaves, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that often encircle the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common sight in riparian habitats."
