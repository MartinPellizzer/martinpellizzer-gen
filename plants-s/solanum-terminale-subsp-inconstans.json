It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its branching structure and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its variability in morphology, it is sometimes confused with other species within the Solanum genus."
