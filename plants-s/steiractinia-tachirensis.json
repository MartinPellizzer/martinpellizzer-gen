    "intro": "Steiractinia tachirensis, commonly known as the Tachirean orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Andean regions of Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Steiractinia tachirensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
