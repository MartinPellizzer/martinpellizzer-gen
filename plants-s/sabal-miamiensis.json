    "intro": "Sabal miamiensis, commonly known as the Miami palm, is a species of palm native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. It is a medium-sized tree that typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 meters. The plant has a slender trunk with smooth, grayish-brown bark and pinnately compound leaves that are feather-like in appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. This plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a common sight in coastal hammocks and dune ecosystems."
