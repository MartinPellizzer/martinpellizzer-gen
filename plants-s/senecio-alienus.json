    "intro": "Senecio alienus, commonly known as the alien groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some parts of the world."
