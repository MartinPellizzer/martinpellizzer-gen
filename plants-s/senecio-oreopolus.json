    "intro": "Senecio oreopolus, commonly known as the Oregon ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
