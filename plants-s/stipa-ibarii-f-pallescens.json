    "intro": "Stipa ibarii f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale stipa, is a rare and distinctive grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pale green leaves and compact, cylindrical inflorescences that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, almost\u7ed2-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
