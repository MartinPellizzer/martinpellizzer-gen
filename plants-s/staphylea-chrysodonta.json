    "intro": "Staphylea chrysodonta, commonly known as the golden-stemmed staphylea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often display a yellowish hue, especially in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Staphylea chrysodonta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
