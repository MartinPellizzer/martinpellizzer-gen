    "intro": "Symphyotrichum patens var. terranigrum, commonly known as the dark-stemmed ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that often turn a dark purple or blackish color as they mature. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This variant is often found in moist to wet habitats, including meadows and stream banks."
