    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 wimmeri, commonly known as the Weeping Willow hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. However, it is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its aggressive spread."
