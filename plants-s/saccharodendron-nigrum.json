    "intro": "Saccharodendron nigrum, commonly known as black sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, deeply furrowed bark and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its leaves are palmately lobed, typically with three to five distinct lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The sap of Saccharodendron nigrum can be tapped and boiled to produce maple syrup, though it is less commonly used for commercial purposes compared to other maple species."
