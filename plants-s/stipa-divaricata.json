    "intro": "Stipa divaricata, commonly known as the silvergrass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted inflorescences that resemble wheat spikes. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves contribute to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Stipa divaricata is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
