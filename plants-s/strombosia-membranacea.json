    "intro": "Strombosia membranacea, commonly known as the paperleaf strombosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Strombosia membranacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
