    "intro": "Striga alba, commonly known as the white witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of cereal crops like maize and sorghum. The plant produces small, white, egg-shaped seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years. Its rapid growth and ability to cause significant yield losses make it a major agricultural pest in sub-Saharan Africa. The botanical study of Striga alba is crucial for developing effective control strategies in affected regions."
