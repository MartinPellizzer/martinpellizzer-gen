    "intro": "Schizoloma decaryanum, commonly known as the Decary's star lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive star-like appearance due to its unique thallus structure. It typically grows on bark and wood in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a complex symbiotic relationship between its fungal and algal components, which contribute to its growth and survival. Its thallus is usually yellowish to orange in color, with lobes that are often arranged in a radiating pattern. Schizoloma decaryanum plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator species for certain forest ecosystems."
