    "intro": "Smilax reniformis, commonly known as the arrowleaf smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for various wildlife. Smilax reniformis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it both a persistent weed and an important component of native plant communities."
