    "intro": "Schefflera kollmannii, commonly known as the Kollmann's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera kollmannii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
