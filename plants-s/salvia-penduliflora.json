    "intro": "Salvia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of violet-blue flowers that hang in pendulous clusters, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes."
