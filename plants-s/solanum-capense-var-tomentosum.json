    "intro": "Solanum capense var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
