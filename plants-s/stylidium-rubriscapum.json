    "intro": "Stylidium rubriscapum, commonly known as the red-capped triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red, cap-like structure that covers the base of its flowering stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often hidden beneath the red cap, which is a unique adaptation for attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Stylidium rubriscapum is a member of the family Haemodoraceae, which includes other triggerplants known for their specialized pollination mechanisms."
