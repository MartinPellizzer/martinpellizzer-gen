    "intro": "Salix olivacea var. thuilleriana, commonly known as the Thuillier's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often silvery-white underneath. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping in cooler climates."
