    "intro": "Solanum cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night, a trait common among many nightshade species. Its leaves are generally ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Solanum cuatrecasasii is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
