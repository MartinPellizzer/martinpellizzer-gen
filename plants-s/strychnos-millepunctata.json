It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with numerous small, dot-like stipules. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright orange or red berries. Its fruits are adapted for dispersal by animals, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
