    "intro": "Solanum microphyllum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are densely covered with a fine, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when mature, contain toxic compounds and are not suitable for human consumption. Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful management."
