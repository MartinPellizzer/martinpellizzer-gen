    "intro": "Sisyrinchium laterale, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it spreads through rhizomes or seeds. Sisyrinchium laterale is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
