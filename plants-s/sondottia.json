It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spurred orchid flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Sondottia is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of resilience in harsh climates. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in ecological and horticultural research."
