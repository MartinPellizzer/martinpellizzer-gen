    "intro": "Satyrium atherstonei, commonly known as the Atherstone's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the limestone grasslands of southern England. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil, often in areas with a history of grazing. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species."
