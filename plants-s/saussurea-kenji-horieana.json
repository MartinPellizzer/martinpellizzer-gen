    "intro": "Saussurea kenji-horieana, commonly known as the Kenji-Horiean saffron plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate yellow flowers. The plant is noted for its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, forming a compact inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
