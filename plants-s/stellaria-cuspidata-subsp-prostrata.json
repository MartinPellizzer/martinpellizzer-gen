    "intro": "Stellaria cuspidata subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that lie flat on the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks."
