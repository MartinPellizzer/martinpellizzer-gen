    "intro": "Stenomesson incarum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Stenomesson incarum is often found in disturbed sites and can be an indicator of well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
