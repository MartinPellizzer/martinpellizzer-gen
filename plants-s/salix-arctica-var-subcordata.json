    "intro": "Salix arctica var. subcordata, commonly known as the arctic willow or subcordate willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to withstand extreme climatic conditions."
