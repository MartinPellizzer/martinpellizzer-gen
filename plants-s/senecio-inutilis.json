It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads. Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
