    "intro": "Sida megapotamica, commonly known as the Brazilian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is an annual herb that grows up to 2 meters tall, featuring opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the morning. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Sida megapotamica is adapted to various soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural fields."
