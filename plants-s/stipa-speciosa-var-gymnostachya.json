    "intro": "Stipa speciosa var. gymnostachya, commonly known as the showy feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
