    "intro": "Saxifraga rhomboidea var. franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, moist climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
