It is characterized by its striking, coral-like flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis carnosa prefers warm, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
