    "intro": "Stellaria aquatica, commonly known as water starwort, is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. It has delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which help attract pollinators like bees and flies. The plant's leaves are slender and arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to float or grow submerged depending on water conditions. Stellaria aquatica is an annual plant, meaning it completes its life cycle within one growing season. Its presence often indicates good water quality, making it an important indicator species in aquatic ecosystems."
