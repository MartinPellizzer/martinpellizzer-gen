    "intro": "Smilax herbacea var. angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, berry-like fruits, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in natural landscapes."
