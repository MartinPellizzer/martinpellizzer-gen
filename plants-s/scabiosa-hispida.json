It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Scabiosa hispida is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
