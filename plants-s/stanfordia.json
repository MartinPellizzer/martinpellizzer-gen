It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin. The plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. Stanfordia species are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, waxy leaves. They are known for their unique ecological role as pollinators attract nocturnal insects and bats."
