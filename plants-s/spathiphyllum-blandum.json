    "intro": "Spathiphyllum blandum, commonly known as the peace lily, is a tropical plant native to the understory of forests in Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking white spathes that enclose small, greenish-yellow flowers. It is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Spathiphyllum blandum is also known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of humidity levels."
