It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are followed by edible, sour fruits resembling small, elongated pods. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, making it useful in furniture and construction. Syzygium costulatum thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas."
