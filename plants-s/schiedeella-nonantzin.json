    "intro": "Schiedeella nonantzin, commonly known as the Mexican bristle fern, is a rare and unusual member of the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, finely divided, bristle-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Schiedeella nonantzin is primarily epiphytic, growing on trees rather than in soil, and requires high levels of moisture and organic matter. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
