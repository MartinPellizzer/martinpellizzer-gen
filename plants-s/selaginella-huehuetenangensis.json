    "intro": "Selaginella huehuetenangensis, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary history as a primitive vascular plant with adaptations for survival in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
