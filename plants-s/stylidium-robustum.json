    "intro": "Stylidium robustum, commonly known as the robust triggerplant, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers. The plant has a unique mechanism for pollination, as its spurred petals trigger the release of pollen when touched. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats. Stylidium robustum is an erect perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters."
