    "intro": "Smilax herbacea var. humilis, commonly known as the creeping smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, woody stems that often trail along the ground or climb low structures. The plant produces small, spiny stems and has distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow-green and appear in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. This species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
