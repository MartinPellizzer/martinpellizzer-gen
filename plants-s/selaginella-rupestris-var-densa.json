    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. densa, commonly known as the dense spiky clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the spores for reproduction. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions."
