    "intro": "Saccolabium calceolare, commonly known as the \"cow-cup\" or \"cupped milkweed,\" is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, cup-shaped bracts that surround the flower cluster, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Saccolabium calceolare is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
