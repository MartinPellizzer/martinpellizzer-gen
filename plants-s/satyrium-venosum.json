    "intro": "Satyrium venosum, commonly known as the veiny orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display intricate patterns of venation, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous minute seeds. The botanical features of Satyrium venosum make it a unique and ecologically significant component of its native habitats."
