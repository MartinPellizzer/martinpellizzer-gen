    "intro": "Solanum asperum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It features distinctive, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark blue or black color, containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and requires caution when handling."
