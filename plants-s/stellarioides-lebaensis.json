    "intro": "Stellarioides lebaensis, commonly known as the Leba starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Africa. It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
