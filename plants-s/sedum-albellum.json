    "intro": "Sedum albellum, commonly known as the silver rose, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense mat or low-growing shrub. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Sedum albellum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions with minimal care."
