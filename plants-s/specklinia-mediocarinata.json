    "intro": "Specklinia mediocarinata, commonly known as the small-leafed staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with overlapping, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than soil. Its fronds are usually dark green with a slightly glossy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. Specklinia mediocarinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of care in humid environments."
