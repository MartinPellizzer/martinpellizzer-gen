    "intro": "Stelis leptorhiza, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without being parasitic. Stelis leptorhiza is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
