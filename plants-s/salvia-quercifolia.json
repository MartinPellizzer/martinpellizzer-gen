    "intro": "Salvia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in whorled clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
