    "intro": "Sinapis turgida, commonly known as the inflated mustard, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its swollen, pod-like fruits that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed areas and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by the distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Sinapis turgida is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
