    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon sagraeanum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stigmaphyllon, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky or wooded slopes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
