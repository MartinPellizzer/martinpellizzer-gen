    "intro": "Sambucus pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae) and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible when fully ripe but can be toxic if consumed raw. Sambucus pulverulenta is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
