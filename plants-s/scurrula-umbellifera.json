    "intro": "Scurrula umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrella scurrula, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Scurrula umbellifera is an annual herb that produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse its seeds through wind."
