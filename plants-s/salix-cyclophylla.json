    "intro": "Salix cyclophylla, commonly known as the cyclophylla willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered catkins during the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
