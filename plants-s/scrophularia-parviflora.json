    "intro": "Scrophularia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered figwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features square, hairy stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are tubular, violet to purple in color, and appear in clusters at the leaf axils. Scrophularia parviflora is often found in association with other members of the Scrophulariaceae family, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
