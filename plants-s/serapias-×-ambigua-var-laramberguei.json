    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 ambigua var. laramberguei, commonly known as the Larambergue's hybrid orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Serapias ambiguus and Serapias laramberguei. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and the Alps. The plant features showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with contrasting purple or red markings. Its inflorescence is a raceme of several to many flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are basal, linear, and somewhat succulent, adapted to the harsh, alpine environments where it thrives."
