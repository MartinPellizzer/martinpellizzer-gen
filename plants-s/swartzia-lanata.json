    "intro": "Swartzia lanata, commonly known as the woolly swartzia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and pinnate leaves with soft, white-hairy undersides. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, oval seeds. Swartzia lanata is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and hard, durable wood. Its growth habit and botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
