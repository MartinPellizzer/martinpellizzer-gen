    "intro": "Selago namaquensis, commonly known as the Namibian star grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. Selago namaquensis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
