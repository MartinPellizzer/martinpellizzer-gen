    "intro": "Struthiopteris, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its robust, often evergreen fronds that can grow quite large, with a distinctive, often deeply lobed or pinnate structure. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are often protected by a specialized structure called an indusium."
