    "intro": "Sideroxylon apoense, commonly known as the Philippine ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. The plant has simple, opposite, and leathery leaves that are dark green in color. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Sideroxylon apoense is considered a vulnerable species."
