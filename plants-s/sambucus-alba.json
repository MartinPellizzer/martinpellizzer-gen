    "intro": "Sambucus alba, commonly known as the white elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have 5 to 9 ovate leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. Sambucus alba is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental plants due to its attractive appearance and seasonal interest."
