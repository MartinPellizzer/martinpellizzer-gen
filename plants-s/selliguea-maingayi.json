    "intro": "Selliguea maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense, carpet-like growths on rocky substrates. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in specialized leaf-like structures called gemma cups. Selliguea maingayi plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
