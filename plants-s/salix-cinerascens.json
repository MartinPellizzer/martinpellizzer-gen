    "intro": "Salix cinerascens, commonly known as the ash willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Salix cinerascens thrives in moist, often riparian habitats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
