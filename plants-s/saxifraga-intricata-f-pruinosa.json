    "intro": "Saxifraga intricata f. pruinosa, commonly known as the powdered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a soft, velvety texture due to the presence of a waxy coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
