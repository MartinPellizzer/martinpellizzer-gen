    "intro": "Sideroxylon bequaertii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
