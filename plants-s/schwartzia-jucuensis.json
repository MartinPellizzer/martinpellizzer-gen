    "intro": "Schwartzia jucuensis, commonly known as the Jucu blackwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
