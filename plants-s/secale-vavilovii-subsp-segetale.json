    "intro": "Secale vavilovii subsp. segetale, commonly known as ryegrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically greenish or brown in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This species is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
