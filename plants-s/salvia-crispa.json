    "intro": "Salvia crispa, commonly known as the wrinkled sage, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet or blue-purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Salvia crispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
