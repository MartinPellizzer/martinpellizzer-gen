    "intro": "Salix laurentina, commonly known as the Laurentian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically green on top and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland habitats. Salix laurentina is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
