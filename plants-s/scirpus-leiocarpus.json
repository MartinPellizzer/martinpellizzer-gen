    "intro": "Scirpus leiocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Scirpus leiocarpus plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
