    "intro": "Sorbus shirinensis, commonly known as the Persian whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, orange to red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
