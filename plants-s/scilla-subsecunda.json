    "intro": "Scilla subsecunda, commonly known as the lesser scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It typically grows to a height of about 15-30 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant blooms in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Scilla subsecunda is relatively hardy and can naturalize over time in suitable conditions."
