    "intro": "Schizachyrium cubense, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and woodland environments. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery red in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that are typically brown or tan in color. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Schizachyrium cubense plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance in native plant communities."
