It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite, pinnately divided leaves. The leaves are typically green and have a serrated or lobed margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, fleshy fruits. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in humid climates."
