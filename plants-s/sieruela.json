    "intro": "Sieruela, commonly known as the common sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has triangular stems, which is a distinguishing feature of many sedges, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Sieruela produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, and it often grows in dense clusters. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
