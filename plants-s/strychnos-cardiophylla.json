    "intro": "Strychnos cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaved strychnos, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
