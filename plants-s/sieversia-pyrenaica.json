It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
