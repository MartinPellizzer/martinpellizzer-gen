It features a fibrous root system and upright, branched stems that are often covered in a sticky resin. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating that contributes to the plant's sticky texture. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically producing yellow or greenish blooms. This plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
