    "intro": "Stelis herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to trees or other surfaces without being parasitic. Stelis herzogii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its delicate and unusual floral display."
