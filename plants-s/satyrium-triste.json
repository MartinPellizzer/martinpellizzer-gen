    "intro": "Satyrium triste, commonly known as the sad orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include a slender stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Satyrium triste is considered a vulnerable species."
