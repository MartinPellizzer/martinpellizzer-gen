    "intro": "Schizaea digitata var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in spore-bearing cones at the tips of the stems. This variety is distinguished by its orbicular (rounded) leaf shape, which sets it apart from other varieties of Schizaea."
