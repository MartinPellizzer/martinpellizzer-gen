It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often obovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, segmented fruits with a sweet and tangy flavor. Its fruit is encased in a thick, leathery rind that contains several fleshy segments. The plant is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal properties."
