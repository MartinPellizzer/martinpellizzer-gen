    "intro": "Stellaria glauca f. virens, commonly known as green starwort, is a variant of the starwort plant characterized by its predominantly green foliage. This form exhibits a more subdued coloration compared to the typical blue-green hue of the species, with leaves that are generally less hairy. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The flowers are small, white or pale blue, and arranged in clusters, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its botanical features make it a distinctive yet subtle addition to its native habitats."
