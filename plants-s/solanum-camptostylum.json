    "intro": "Solanum camptostylum, commonly known as the purple nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, egg-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, and it produces small, dark purple berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
