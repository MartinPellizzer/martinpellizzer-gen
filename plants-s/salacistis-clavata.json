    "intro": "Salacistis clavata, commonly known as the clustered club-moss, is a small evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically found at the base of the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its delicate structure, it is often used in horticultural displays for its ornamental value."
