    "intro": "Selenicereus validus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and large, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces white, star-shaped blooms that emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers typically last only one night, making it a rare and striking sight in the botanical world. Selenicereus validus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
