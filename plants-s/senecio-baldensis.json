    "intro": "Senecio baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine environments. It is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
