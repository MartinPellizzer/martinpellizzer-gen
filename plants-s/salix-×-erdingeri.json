    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 erdingeri, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix alba and Salix matsudana. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, typical of many willow species. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found near water sources. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations in leaf shape and growth habit."
