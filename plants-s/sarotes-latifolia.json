It is characterized by its wide, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers, which bloom in summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice among gardeners in arid regions."
