    "intro": "Stelis triplex, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Stelis triplex is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
