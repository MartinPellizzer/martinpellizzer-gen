    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 vitellina var. aurea, commonly known as the golden willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which turns bronze in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it typically blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it suitable for erosion control and landscaping in suitable climates."
