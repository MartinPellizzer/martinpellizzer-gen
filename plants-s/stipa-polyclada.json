    "intro": "Stipa polyclada, commonly known as the many-stemmed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces feathery inflorescences composed of multiple spikelets, which are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa polyclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
