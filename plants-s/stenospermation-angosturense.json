    "intro": "Stenospermation angosturense, commonly known as the narrow-seed orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces small, elongated seeds enclosed in a thin, fibrous capsule, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
