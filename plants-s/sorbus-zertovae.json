    "intro": "Sorbus zertovae, commonly known as the Zertovae whitebeam, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in forested areas at higher altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
