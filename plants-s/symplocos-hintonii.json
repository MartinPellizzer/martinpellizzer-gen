    "intro": "Symplocos hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's waxleaf. It is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China, characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that remains green throughout much of the year. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Symplocos hintonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to shaded garden environments."
