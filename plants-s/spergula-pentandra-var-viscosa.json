    "intro": "Spergula pentandra var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, sticky substance, which helps it retain moisture and deter herbivores. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
