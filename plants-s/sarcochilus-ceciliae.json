    "intro": "Sarcochilus ceciliae, commonly known as Cecilia's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green to white flowers that have a velvety texture. The plant typically grows on the forest floor, often in shaded, humid environments, and has a distinctive, narrow pseudobulb. Its flowers are usually fragrant and bloom during the warmer months, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Sarcochilus ceciliae is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
