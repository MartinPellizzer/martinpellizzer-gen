    "intro": "Silene acaulis subsp. vanensis, commonly known as the mountain rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, typically arranged in a single umbel at the apex of the stem. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high altitude, strong winds, and low nutrient soils. Silene acaulis subsp. vanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians."
