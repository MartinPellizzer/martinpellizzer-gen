    "intro": "Salix hookeriana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its grayish-white pubescent bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
