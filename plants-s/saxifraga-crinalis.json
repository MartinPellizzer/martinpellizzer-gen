    "intro": "Saxifraga crinalis, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-white, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Saxifraga crinalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand extreme cold and wind."
