It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and poor, well-draining conditions. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. This species is known for its resilience and ability to survive in harsh, arid environments."
