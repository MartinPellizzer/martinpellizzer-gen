    "intro": "Stevia amabilis, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing tiny, white seeds. Stevia amabilis is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides, making it a natural sweetener. Its leaves are often used in herbal teas and as a sugar substitute due to their low caloric content."
