It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which release spores for reproduction. Selaginella feei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
