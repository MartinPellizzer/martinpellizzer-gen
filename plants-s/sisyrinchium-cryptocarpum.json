    "intro": "Sisyrinchium cryptocarpum, commonly known as the hidden-fruit blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Iridaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces its fruits in a closed capsule, a feature that gives it its scientific name \"cryptocarpum,\" meaning \"hidden fruit.\" It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Sisyrinchium cryptocarpum is native to the eastern United States and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments."
