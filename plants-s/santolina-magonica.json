    "intro": "Santolina magonica, commonly known as the narrowleaf santolina, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Santolina magonica is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
