    "intro": "Strongylodon agusanensis, commonly known as the Agusan starfruit, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, melons, and gourds. The plant is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruits, which are typically yellow-orange when mature. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments, often growing in the understory where it receives filtered sunlight. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Strongylodon agusanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
