    "intro": "Symphipappus, commonly known as the stickyseed or desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their hairy, often glandular leaves and yellow to orange composite flowers. The fruits, called achenes, are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Symphipappus species are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and water-storing tissues."
