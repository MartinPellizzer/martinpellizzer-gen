    "intro": "Salix lapponum subsp. marrubiifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a common feature in willow species. It thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various arctic and alpine wildlife."
