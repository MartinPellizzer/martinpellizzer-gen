    "intro": "Simira wurdackii, commonly known as the Amazonian white cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of the understory in tropical rainforests. Due to its slow growth and limited range, Simira wurdackii is considered a valuable but rare species in its native habitat."
