    "intro": "Saxifraga nervosa subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its hairy foliage helps to reduce water loss and protect against harsh weather conditions."
