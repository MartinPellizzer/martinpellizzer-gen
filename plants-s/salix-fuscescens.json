    "intro": "Salix fuscescens, commonly known as the dark willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
