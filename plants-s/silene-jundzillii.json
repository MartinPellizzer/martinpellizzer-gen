    "intro": "Silene jundzillii, commonly known as the Jundzillii campion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. Silene jundzillii is a perennial species with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
