    "intro": "Sinoradlkofera, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbean, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its leguminous pods and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cold, temperate climates. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer, followed by the development of elongated, slender pods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sinoradlkofera is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
