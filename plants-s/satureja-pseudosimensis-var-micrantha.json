    "intro": "Satureja pseudosimensis var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved savory, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves with a distinct mint-like scent, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to both wild and cultivated settings. The species is also valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of the genus."
