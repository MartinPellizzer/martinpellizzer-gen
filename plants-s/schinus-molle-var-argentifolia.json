    "intro": "Schinus molle var. argentifolia, commonly known as silverleaf tree or silver thorn, is a variant of the common velvet tree native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, spiny fruits. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating that reflects light. It thrives in dry, temperate climates and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
