    "intro": "Silene glareosa subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate glitterweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the southwestern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Silene glareosa subsp. prostrata is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
