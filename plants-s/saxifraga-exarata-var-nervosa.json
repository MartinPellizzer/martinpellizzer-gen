It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are characterized by distinct, prominent veins, giving it its specific variety name \"nervosa.\" It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
