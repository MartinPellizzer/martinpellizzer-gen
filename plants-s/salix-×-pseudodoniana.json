    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 pseudodoniana, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of many willow species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
