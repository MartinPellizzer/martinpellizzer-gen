    "intro": "Swietenia multijuga, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical hardwood tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces oval, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its heartwood is highly valued for its rich reddish-brown color, fine grain, and durability. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List."
