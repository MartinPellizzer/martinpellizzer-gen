    "intro": "Salix sawatchicola, commonly known as the Sawatch willow, is a shrub native to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and along streambanks. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
