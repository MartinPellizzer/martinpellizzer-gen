It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually a deep green, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stabilization and habitat for microorganisms."
