    "intro": "Silene obtusifolia, commonly known as blunt-leaved catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or loamy soils and thrives in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a blunt or rounded tip, and the flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Silene obtusifolia is often found in disturbed sites and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
