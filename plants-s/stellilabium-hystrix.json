    "intro": "Stellilabium hystrix, commonly known as the spiked star-labium, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated petals that resemble small, spiky stars, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually a vibrant mix of white and purple, with a distinctive, spurred labellum that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat, Stellilabium hystrix is often found in isolated regions with high humidity and minimal human disturbance."
