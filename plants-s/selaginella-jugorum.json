    "intro": "Selaginella jugorum, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Selaginella jugorum reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. This resilient plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
