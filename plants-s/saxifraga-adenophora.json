    "intro": "Saxifraga adenophora, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Saxifraga adenophora is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
