    "intro": "Salix falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, making it a dioecious species. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as stream banks and riparian zones, and is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth. The bark of Salix falcata is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is known for its adaptability to various soil types."
