It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive banded pattern. Scorzonera fasciata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It is also valued in some regions for its edible roots, which are similar in texture to potatoes."
