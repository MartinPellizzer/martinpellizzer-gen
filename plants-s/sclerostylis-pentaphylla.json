    "intro": "Sclerostylis pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leafed star-petiole, is a member of the family Restionaceae, native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and linear, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
