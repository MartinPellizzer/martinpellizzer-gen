    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris var. brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunoniana star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in rocky or alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and delicate floral display."
