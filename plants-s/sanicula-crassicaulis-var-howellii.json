It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. This variant is distinguished by its broader stems and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Sanicula species."
