    "intro": "Silene armeria, commonly known as the sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Silene armeria thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along cliffs. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
