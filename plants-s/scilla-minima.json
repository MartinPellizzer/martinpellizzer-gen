    "intro": "Scilla minima, commonly known as the lesser scilla, is a small, bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in dry conditions, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Scilla minima is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring display."
