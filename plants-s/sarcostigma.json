    "intro": "Sarcostigma, commonly known as the \"sac-like stigma,\" is a specialized structure found in certain flowering plants, particularly in the genus *Sarcostigma* within the family Malvaceae. It is a modified stigma that is often sac-like in shape, serving as a receptive organ for pollen during pollination. This structure is typically covered in fine hairs that aid in the adherence of pollen grains. The sarcostigma plays a crucial role in the reproductive process by facilitating the transfer of genetic material. Its unique morphology and function make it an interesting subject in the study of plant reproductive biology."
