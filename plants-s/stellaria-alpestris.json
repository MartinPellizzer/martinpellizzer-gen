It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Stellaria alpestris plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
