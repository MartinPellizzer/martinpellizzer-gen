    "intro": "Sideroxylon steyermarkii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
