    "intro": "Stachychrysum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their dense, compact growth habit and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to the plant's drought tolerance. Stachychrysum species are popular in horticulture for their long-lasting flowers and ability to thrive in dry conditions. They are often used in dried flower arrangements due to their vibrant color and durability."
