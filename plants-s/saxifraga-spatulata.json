    "intro": "Saxifraga spatulata, commonly known as the spoon-leaved saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga spatulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
