    "intro": "Spiradiclis caespitosa f. subimersa, commonly known as the submersed spiradiclis, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its submerged growth habit. It forms dense, compact clumps with slender, thread-like stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for underwater pollination. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, arranged in whorls around the stem. This subspecies is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes."
