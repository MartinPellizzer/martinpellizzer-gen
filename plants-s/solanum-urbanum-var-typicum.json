    "intro": "Solanum urbanum var. typicum, commonly known as the urban nightshade, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm and features simple, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in urban environments, vacant lots, and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
