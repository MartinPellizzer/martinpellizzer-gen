    "intro": "Sedum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, spiny leaves that help it store water and reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its adaptive traits make it well-suited for drought-tolerant landscapes."
