It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees or rocks in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Stelis cavernula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
