    "intro": "Sorbus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is often covered in a rusty, flaky layer, giving it its common name. Sorbus ferruginea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
