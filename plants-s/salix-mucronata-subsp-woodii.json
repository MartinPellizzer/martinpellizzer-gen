    "intro": "Salix mucronata subsp. woodii, commonly known as the Wood's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, varying in size depending on the environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and adaptability to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
