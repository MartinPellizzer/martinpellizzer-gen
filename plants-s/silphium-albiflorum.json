It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Silphium albiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
