It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It is drought-tolerant and can form dense mats, making it useful for erosion control. Stenotaphrum clavigerum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
