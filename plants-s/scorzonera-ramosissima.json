    "intro": "Scorzonera ramosissima, commonly known as the common scorzonera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped tubers beneath the soil, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Scorzonera ramosissima thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal remedies."
