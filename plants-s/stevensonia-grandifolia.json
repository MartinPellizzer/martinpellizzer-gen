    "intro": "Stevensonia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered Stevensonia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and the plant can reach heights of up to 3 feet. Stevensonia grandifolia is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
