    "intro": "Sida tridentata, commonly known as three-toothed sida, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, triangular leaves and produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy conditions. Sida tridentata is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
