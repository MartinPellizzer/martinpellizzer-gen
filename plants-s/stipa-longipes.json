    "intro": "Stipa longipes, commonly known as the long-headed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are typically golden or brown in color, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Stipa longipes thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
