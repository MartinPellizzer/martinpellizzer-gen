    "intro": "Sphaeranthus salinarum, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, spherical flowers and succulent leaves adapted to retain water. The plant thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its root system is highly efficient at filtering out salt, allowing it to flourish in harsh environments. Sphaeranthus salinarum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various small organisms."
