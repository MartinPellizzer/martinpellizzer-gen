    "intro": "Strigilia subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, borne in clusters at the base of the stems. Strigilia subcordata is notable for its resilience to drought and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
