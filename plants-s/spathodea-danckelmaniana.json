    "intro": "Spathodea danckelmaniana, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are large, simple, and alternate, with a smooth, glossy surface. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to 20 meters tall in its natural habitat."
