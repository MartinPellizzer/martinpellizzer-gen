    "intro": "Solanum olgae, commonly known as the Olgae nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with woody stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually purple or violet, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticulture and is more commonly found in wild or semi-wild environments."
