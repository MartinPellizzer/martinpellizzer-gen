    "intro": "Stenospermation parvum, commonly known as the narrow-seed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricately shaped flowers. The plant produces a unique type of seed capsule that is narrow and elongated, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
