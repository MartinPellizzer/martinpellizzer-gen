    "intro": "Salix anglorum, commonly known as the English willow, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and bright green on top. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses. The bark is typically grey or brown and becomes fissured with age."
