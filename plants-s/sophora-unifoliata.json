    "intro": "Sophora unifoliata, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically simple and lanceolate, and its showy, pendulous racemes of fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. The species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
