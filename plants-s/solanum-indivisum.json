It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white to purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
