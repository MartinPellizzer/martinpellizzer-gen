    "intro": "Sarcolobus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. Sarcolobus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to form dense stands."
