    "intro": "Selenicereus grandiflorus subsp. grandiflorus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in warm, humid environments. Its flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and unique blooming habit."
