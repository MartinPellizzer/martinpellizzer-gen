    "intro": "Sorghum \u00d7 aterrimum var. angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf sorghum, is a hybrid grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which make it well-suited for marginal soils and dry climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with inflorescences that are spike-like and composed of small, two-rowed panicles. It is often used in forage production and has potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, parallel-veined leaves, and a C4 photosynthetic pathway, which enhances its drought tolerance."
