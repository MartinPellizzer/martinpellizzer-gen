It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of pinnate fronds that give it a graceful appearance. Steiropteris glabra thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and helps anchor the plant in moist, well-drained soil."
