    "intro": "Stapelia bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces striking, yellowish-orange flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Stapelia bidentata is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
