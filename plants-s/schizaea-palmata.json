    "intro": "Schizaea palmata, commonly known as the common clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to form dense mats or cushions. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Schizaea palmata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain the sporangia that produce spores for propagation."
