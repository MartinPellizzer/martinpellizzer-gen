    "intro": "Scelochilus crucicornibus, commonly known as the horned shield fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, shield-like fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces erect, branching fronds with a leathery texture. Its leaves are typically bi-lobed, with a prominent central vein and a crinkled appearance. Scelochilus crucicornibus thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's morphology reflects its adaptation to moist, nutrient-rich soils in forest understories."
