    "intro": "Sempervivum arachnoideum subsp. piliferum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated as a garden plant."
