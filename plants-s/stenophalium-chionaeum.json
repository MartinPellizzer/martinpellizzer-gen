    "intro": "Stenophalium chionaeum, commonly known as the snowflake pincushion, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that resembles a pincushion, with soft, white to pale blue hairs covering the stems and leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
