    "intro": "Scutia discolor, commonly known as the white scutia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually white or pale green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Scutia discolor thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
