    "intro": "[WRONG START] Styrophyllum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky sea fan, is a marine coral that belongs to the order Gorgonacea. It is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure and is typically found in shallow coastal waters. The plant has a soft, flexible skeleton composed of calcium carbonate, which gives it its distinctive appearance. Stylophyllum viscidum thrives in warm, tropical seas and is often found in association with other marine organisms. Its sticky secretions help in capturing plankton, contributing to its survival in aquatic environments."
