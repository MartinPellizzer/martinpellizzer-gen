    "intro": "Suaeda arctica, commonly known as Arctic saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments, often found in coastal areas and salt marshes. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats. Suaeda arctica is adapted to extreme cold and is an important component of polar ecosystems."
