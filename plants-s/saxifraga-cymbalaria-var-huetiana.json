It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are usually rosette-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white to pinkish, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
