    "intro": "Stipa almeriensis, commonly known as the Almer\u00eda needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas. Stipa almeriensis is well adapted to arid conditions and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
