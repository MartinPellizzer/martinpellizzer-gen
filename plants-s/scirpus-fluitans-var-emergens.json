    "intro": "Scirpus fluitans var. emergens, commonly known as the floating bulrush, is a variant of the bulrush species that exhibits unique aquatic adaptations. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant features long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the sediment. Its flowering stems rise above the water, producing small, clustered spikes of brownish flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic life."
