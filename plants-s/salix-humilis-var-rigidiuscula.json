    "intro": "Salix humilis var. rigidiuscula, commonly known as the stiff willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder climates."
