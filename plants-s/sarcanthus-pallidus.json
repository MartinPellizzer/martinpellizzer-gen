    "intro": "Sarcanthus pallidus, commonly known as the pale sarcanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, small leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in shaded, humid environments, often growing in forest understories. It has a short lifespan and is known for its unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Sarcanthus pallidus is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
