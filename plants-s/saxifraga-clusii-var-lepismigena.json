    "intro": "Saxifraga clusii var. lepismigena, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and other dry, sunny areas."
