    "intro": "Speculantha clivosa, commonly known as the cliff heath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or cliff habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
