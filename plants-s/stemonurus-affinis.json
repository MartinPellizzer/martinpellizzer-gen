    "intro": "Stemonurus affinis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stemonurus, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Stemonurus affinis is often found in rich, loamy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
