    "intro": "Strychnos villosa, commonly known as the hairy strychnos, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture. Due to the presence of strychnine and brucine, it is considered poisonous and should be handled with care."
