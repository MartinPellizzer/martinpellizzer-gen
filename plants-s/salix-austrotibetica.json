    "intro": "Salix austrotibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of willow species, containing both male and female flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
