    "intro": "Saxifraga parvula, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with dense clusters of small, bright green leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in crevices or on rocky slopes. Saxifraga parvula is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
