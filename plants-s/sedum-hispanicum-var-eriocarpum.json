    "intro": "Sedum hispanicum var. eriocarpum, commonly known as the Spanish stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water, which helps the plant survive in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The variety 'eriocarpum' is distinguished by its hairy fruits, which aid in seed dispersal."
