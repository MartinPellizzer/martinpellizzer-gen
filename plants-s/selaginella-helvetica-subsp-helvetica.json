    "intro": "Selaginella helvetica subsp. helvetica, commonly known as the Swiss clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Selaginella helvetica subsp. helvetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
