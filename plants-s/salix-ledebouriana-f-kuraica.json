    "intro": "Salix ledebouriana f. kuraica, commonly known as the Kuraica willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often silvery-white underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in cold, arid environments. It is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
