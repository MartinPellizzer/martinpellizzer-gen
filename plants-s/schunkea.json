    "intro": "Schunkea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plants are characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. Schunkea species are often valued for their timber, which is prized for its durability and rich color. However, due to overharvesting, many species are now considered endangered."
