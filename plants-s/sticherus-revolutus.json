    "intro": "Sticherus revolutus, commonly known as the revolute sticherus, is a small, delicate fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a slightly revolute (rolled under) margin, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant's rhizome is short and produces a cluster of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds."
