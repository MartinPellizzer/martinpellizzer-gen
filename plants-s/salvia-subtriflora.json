It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture and grows in clumps, reaching heights of up to 3 feet. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its botanical name reflects its three-flowered clusters, a characteristic feature of the Salvia genus."
