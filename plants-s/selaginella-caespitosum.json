    "intro": "Selaginella caespitosum, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, scale-like leaves arranged in dense clusters. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Selaginella caespitosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
