    "intro": "Seseli brachylobum, commonly known as the California seseli, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
