    "intro": "Sedum stenopetalum subsp. ciliosum, commonly known as the coastal sedum, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called cilia. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid and saline conditions."
