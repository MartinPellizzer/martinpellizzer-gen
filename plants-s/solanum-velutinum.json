    "intro": "Solanum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Solanum velutinum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if ingested."
