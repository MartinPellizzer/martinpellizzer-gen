    "intro": "Solidago fallax, commonly known as the winter tarragon or fall goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight aromatic quality. Solidago fallax is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
