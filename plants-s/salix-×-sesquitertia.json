    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 sesquitertia, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Salix nigra and Salix discolor, resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are elongated, often with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins in early spring, which are characteristic of willow species. This plant is often found in wetland areas and is valued for its adaptability and ornamental qualities."
