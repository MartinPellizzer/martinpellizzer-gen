    "intro": "Statice lanceolata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, showy blue or violet flowers. The plant is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to saline and sandy soils. It typically grows in full sun and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Statice lanceolata is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought resistance and long-lasting blooms."
