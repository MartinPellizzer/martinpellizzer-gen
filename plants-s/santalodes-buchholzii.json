    "intro": "Santalodes buchholzii, commonly known as the Buchholz's sandalwood, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic shrub, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, typically in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
