It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has a straight, cylindrical trunk with smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, often with a waxy coating. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing several seeds."
