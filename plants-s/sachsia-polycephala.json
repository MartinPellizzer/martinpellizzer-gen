    "intro": "Sachsia polycephala, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy red or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
