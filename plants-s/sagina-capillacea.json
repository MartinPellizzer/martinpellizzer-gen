    "intro": "Sagina capillacea, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features a dense mat of tiny, fleshy, prostrate stems that form a cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in groups of three to five. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture in arid environments. Sagina capillacea is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh, alpine or coastal habitats."
