    "intro": "Sideroxylon euphlebium, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree has simple, alternate, and often elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Sideroxylon euphlebium plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
