    "intro": "Streblosa axilliflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved streblosa, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
