    "intro": "Salvia garroussii, commonly known as the hummingbird sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia garroussii is also a valuable nectar source for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and butterflies."
