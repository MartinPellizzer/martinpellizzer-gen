    "intro": "Silene longicilia var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stalked campion, is a flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, and it is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the stems are often branched and covered in fine pubescence. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its shorter pedicels, which give it its common name."
