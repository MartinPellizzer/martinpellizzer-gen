    "intro": "Specklinia resupinata, commonly known as the wrinkled fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, crumpled fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in its humid habitat. Specklinia resupinata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
