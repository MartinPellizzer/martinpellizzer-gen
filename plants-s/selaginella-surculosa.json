    "intro": "Selaginella surculosa, commonly known as the zigzag spike moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Selaginella surculosa produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of its leaves. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in humid environments."
