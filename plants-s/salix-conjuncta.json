    "intro": "Salix conjuncta, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Salix conjuncta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine."
