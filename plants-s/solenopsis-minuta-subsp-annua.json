It is a small, reddish-brown ant that forms colonies in the soil, often in disturbed areas such as lawns and agricultural fields. The plant aspect of this species refers to its association with vegetation, as it forages on plant surfaces and can impact plant health through herbivory. Its life cycle includes a winged reproductive stage that occurs during specific seasons, typically in the spring or early summer. The species is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environments, contributing to its widespread distribution."
