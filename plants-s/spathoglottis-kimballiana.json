It is characterized by its striking, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive yellow or green throat. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of showy, resupinate flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Spathoglottis kimballiana thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
