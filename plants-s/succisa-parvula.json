    "intro": "Succisa parvula, commonly known as the small-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Succisa parvula is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soils. Its succulent leaves and drought tolerance are key botanical features that aid in its survival in harsh conditions."
