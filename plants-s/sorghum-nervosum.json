    "intro": "Sorghum nervosum, commonly known as the woolly sorghum, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and cylindrical spikelets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in poor soil conditions. Its fibrous stalks are used for thatching and as a source of fiber, while its seeds are edible. Sorghum nervosum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
