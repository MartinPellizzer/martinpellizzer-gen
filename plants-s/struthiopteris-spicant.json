    "intro": "Struthiopteris spicant, commonly known as the common cliffbracken, is a species of fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, spore-bearing sori arranged along the margins of the pinnae. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in open woodland. This fern is known for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
