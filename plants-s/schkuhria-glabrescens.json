    "intro": "Schkuhria glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as stream banks, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Schkuhria glabrescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
