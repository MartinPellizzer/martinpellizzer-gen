    "intro": "Sophora glauca, commonly known as the blue sophora, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing flattened seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
