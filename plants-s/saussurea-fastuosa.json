    "intro": "Saussurea fastuosa, commonly known as the Tibetan ghost flower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in traditional medicine practices."
