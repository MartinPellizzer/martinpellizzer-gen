    "intro": "Solanum wilmsii, commonly known as the Wilmsii nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, yellow berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
