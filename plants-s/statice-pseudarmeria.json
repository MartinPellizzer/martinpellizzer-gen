    "intro": "Statice pseudarmeria, commonly known as sea lavender or salt marsh aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species for erosion control. Statice pseudarmeria is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
