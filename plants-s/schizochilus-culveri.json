    "intro": "Schizochilus culveri, commonly known as the Culver's schizochilus, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and intricate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often along forest floors or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive strategy involves a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its survival. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Schizochilus culveri is considered a critically endangered species."
