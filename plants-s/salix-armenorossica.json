    "intro": "Salix armenorossica, commonly known as Armenian weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
