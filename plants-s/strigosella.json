    "intro": "Strigosella, commonly known as the stickyweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Strigosella species are typically found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. They are sometimes considered weeds due to their rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
