    "intro": "Stipa tuckeri, commonly known as the Tucker's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. Stipa tuckeri is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
