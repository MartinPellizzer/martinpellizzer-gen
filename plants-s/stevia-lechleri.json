    "intro": "Stevia lechleri, commonly known as \"Peruvian licorice,\" is a perennial shrub native to the Amazon rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is renowned for its intense sweetness, which comes from compounds called steviol glycosides found in its leaves. These glycosides are up to 300 times sweeter than sucrose, making it a popular natural sweetener. Stevia lechleri is also valued for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
