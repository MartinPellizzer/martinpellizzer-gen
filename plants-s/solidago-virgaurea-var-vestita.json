    "intro": "Solidago virgaurea var. vestita, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters and has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowering heads are composed of many small, disk-like florets surrounded by bracts, which give it a fluffy appearance. Solidago virgaurea var. vestita is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun."
