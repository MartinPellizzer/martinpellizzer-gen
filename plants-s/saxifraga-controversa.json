    "intro": "Saxifraga controversa, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
