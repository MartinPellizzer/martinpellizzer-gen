    "intro": "Selaginella pentaphlebia, commonly known as the Hart's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery leaves that form a dense, grass-like rosette, often with a distinctive tongue-like shape. This plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rock crevices. It exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme drought through a process called poikilohydry, where it can lose and regain water without dying. Selaginella pentaphlebia is also noted for its slow growth and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in specialized horticulture."
