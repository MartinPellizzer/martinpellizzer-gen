    "intro": "Stachys japonica f. glabrata, commonly known as Japanese hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy structures, though the 'glabrata' form is notable for its reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, pale purple to white flowers in whorled clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and light conditions."
