    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
