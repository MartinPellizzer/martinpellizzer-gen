It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies in Mediterranean-type climates."
