    "intro": "Silene arenicola, commonly known as the sand pink, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces showy, pink to magenta flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Silene arenicola plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
