    "intro": "Stelis petiolaris, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, wiry stem with clustered, small, white to pale green flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis petiolaris thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
