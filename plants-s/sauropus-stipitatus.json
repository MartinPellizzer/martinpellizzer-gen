    "intro": "Sauropus stipitatus, commonly known as the red-stemmed sago, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red stems and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. The species is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
