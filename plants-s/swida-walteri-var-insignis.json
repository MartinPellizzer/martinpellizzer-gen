    "intro": "Swida walteri var. insignis, commonly known as the Walter's Swida, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to specific regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic value and ecological interest."
