    "intro": "Saccus laevis, commonly known as the smooth sac plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Saccus laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
