    "intro": "Saniella, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Saniella species are typically grown as houseplants due to their ability to thrive in indoor conditions with moderate light and humidity. They have a fibrous root system and are often propagated through leaf cuttings or division. The flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects such as flies and beetles."
