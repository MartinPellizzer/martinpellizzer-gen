It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
