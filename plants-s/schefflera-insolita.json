    "intro": "Schefflera insolita, commonly known as the giant umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in diameter, giving it a distinctive, umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Schefflera insolita is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens due to its ornamental value and adaptability."
