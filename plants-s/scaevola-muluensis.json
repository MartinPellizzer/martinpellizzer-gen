It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its showy, bilaterally symmetric flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Scaevola muluensis is adapted to grow in rocky and well-drained soils, often in mountainous environments. Its unique floral structure and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
