    "intro": "Sloanea nymanii subsp. nymanii, commonly known as the New Zealand sloanea, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
