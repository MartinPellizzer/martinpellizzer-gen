    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 padellae, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a corymb-like inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
