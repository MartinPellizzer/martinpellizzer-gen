It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues, especially in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months.

Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a wide range of climates, from temperate to alpine environments."
