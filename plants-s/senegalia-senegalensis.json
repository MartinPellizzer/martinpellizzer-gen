    "intro": "Senegalia senegalensis, commonly known as the Acacia senegal, is a shrub or small tree native to the dry regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of India. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well-adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deep underground. Its bark and pods are used to produce gum arabic, a valuable natural substance used in food, pharmaceuticals, and industry. The plant also plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and supporting local wildlife."
