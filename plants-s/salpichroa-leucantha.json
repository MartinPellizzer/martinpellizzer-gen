    "intro": "Salpichroa leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered sand mat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Salpichroa leucantha is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
