    "intro": "Salvia curticalyx, commonly known as the red sage, is a striking perennial plant native to the southern United States. It features showy, tubular red or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Salvia curticalyx is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. It is also a popular choice for attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
