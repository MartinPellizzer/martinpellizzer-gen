    "intro": "Stapelia margarita, commonly known as the \"Cape Thorn\" or \"Margarita Stapelia,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decay. These flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated by flies and beetles. Stapelia margarita is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
