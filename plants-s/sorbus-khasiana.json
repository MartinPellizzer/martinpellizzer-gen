It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
