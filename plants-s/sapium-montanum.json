    "intro": "Sapium montanum, commonly known as mountain soapberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-9 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Its fruit contains seeds enclosed in a thick, waxy coating, which aids in seed dispersal. Sapium montanum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
