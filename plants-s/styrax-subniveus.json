    "intro": "Styrax subniveus, commonly known as the snowbell tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fragrant blossoms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
