    "intro": "Salvia aucheri var. oranensis, commonly known as Persian germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountains of Turkey and the Middle East. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly fuzzy texture. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
