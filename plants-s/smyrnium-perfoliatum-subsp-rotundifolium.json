    "intro": "Smyrnium perfoliatum subsp. rotundifolium, commonly known as round-leaved hogweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white, veined underside. The plant is characterized by its hollow stems that often appear to pass through the leaves, a feature that gives it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near waterways and in woodland edges. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
