    "intro": "Spiraea confusa, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features slender, arching branches. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. Spiraea confusa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges."
