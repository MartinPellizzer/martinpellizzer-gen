    "intro": "Spiraea digitata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in a soft, woolly pubescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for use in borders, rock gardens, or as a foundation plant."
