    "intro": "Selaginella nanophylla, commonly known as the dwarf spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This species is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique ability to survive extreme drought conditions makes it a remarkable example of desiccation tolerance in plants. Selaginella nanophylla plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for small invertebrates."
