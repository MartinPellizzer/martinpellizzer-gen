    "intro": "Syringodea hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid syringodea, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. This plant typically features finely divided, feather-like leaves that emit a subtle, spicy scent when crushed. It produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in compound umbels, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Syringodea hybrida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a range of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Its growth habit is usually upright, with a compact form that makes it suitable for both garden beds and container planting."
