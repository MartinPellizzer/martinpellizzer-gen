    "intro": "Selaginella arbuscula var. menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of closely packed, needle-like leaves that form a dense, moss-like appearance. It produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are located at the tips of its stems. This variety is notable for its resilience and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
