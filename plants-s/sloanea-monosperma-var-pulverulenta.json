    "intro": "Sloanea monosperma var. pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered sloanea, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
