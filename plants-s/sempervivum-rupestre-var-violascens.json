    "intro": "Sempervivum rupestre var. violascens, commonly known as the Violet Rock Sage, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive violet hue on the upper surfaces. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
