    "intro": "Sorbus sitchensis subsp. grayi, commonly known as the Sitka mountain-ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and consist of 5-9 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Sorbus sitchensis."
