    "intro": "Stelis beckii, commonly known as the Beck's stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive pattern of markings. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis beckii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
