It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and its flowers are tubular with two lips, typical of the mint family. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety multiglandulosa is distinguished by its numerous glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which contribute to its unique botanical characteristics."
