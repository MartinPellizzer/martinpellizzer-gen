    "intro": "Stipa bufensis, commonly known as the golden needle grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale golden spikelets that are clustered along the stems, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Stipa bufensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
