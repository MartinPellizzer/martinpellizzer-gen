    "intro": "Selago immersa, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, hence its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its submerged leaves are typically narrow and ribbon-like, while its floating leaves are broader and often have a waxy coating. Selago immersa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
