    "intro": "Stenoptera brachystachys, commonly known as the narrow-leafed spurge, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its stem is cylindrical and can branch out, forming a compact shrub. Stenoptera brachystachys is well-suited to rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens."
