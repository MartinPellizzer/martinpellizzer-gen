    "intro": "Silphium perfoliatum f. petiolatum, commonly known as the petioled milkweed, is a rare and ancient plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated petioles that extend beyond the base of the leaves, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are pollinated by various insects, including bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Silphium perfoliatum f. petiolatum is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a food source for wildlife."
