It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among gardeners in dry climates."
