    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 gayeri, commonly known as the hybrid weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Salix nigra and Salix triandra, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, making it visually striking. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Salix \u00d7 gayeri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands."
