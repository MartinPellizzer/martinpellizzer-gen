    "intro": "Spirodela oligorrhiza var. melanorrhiza, commonly known as blackroot watermilfoil, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features broad, dark green, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by tiny, floating seeds. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting water quality and native plant communities."
