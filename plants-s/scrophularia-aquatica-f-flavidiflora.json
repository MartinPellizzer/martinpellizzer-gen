    "intro": "Scrophularia aquatica f. flavidiflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered water scrophularia, is a botanical variant of the water scrophularia species. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist soils along riverbanks and pond edges. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and can reach up to 60 cm in height. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral characteristics and ecological adaptations."
