It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically lobed or entire. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by small, spiky fruits called achenes. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
