    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum subavene, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the dense, shaded understories of tropical rainforests. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's rhizome system is highly developed, allowing it to anchor itself in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Sciodaphyllum subavene is considered a vulnerable species, with limited distribution and ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
