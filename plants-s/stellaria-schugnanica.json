    "intro": "Stellaria schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnan starwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
