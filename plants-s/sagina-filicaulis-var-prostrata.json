    "intro": "Sagina filicaulis var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, acidic environments. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish-white in color, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense carpets on the ground. This variety is often found in shaded, woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
