    "intro": "Salvia psilostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular plant in arid-region gardens."
