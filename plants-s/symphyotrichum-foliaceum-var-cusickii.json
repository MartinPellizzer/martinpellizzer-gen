    "intro": "Symphyotrichum foliaceum var. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy, blue to purple ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and prairies, often forming low, spreading mats. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the typical form of Symphyotrichum foliaceum."
