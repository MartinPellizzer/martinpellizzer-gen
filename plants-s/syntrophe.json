    "intro": "Syntrophe, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or spoon-shaped, with a hairy surface. They produce small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Syntrophe species are often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, and they play a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
