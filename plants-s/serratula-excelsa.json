    "intro": "Serratula excelsa, commonly known as the tall yellow weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has serrated leaves that are often hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a weed in agricultural areas. Serratula excelsa is also known for its medicinal properties, though it can be toxic in high doses."
