    "intro": "Serruria andrewsii, commonly known as the Cape rose, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, particularly in coastal and Mediterranean climates. Serruria andrewsii is also valued for its resilience and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
