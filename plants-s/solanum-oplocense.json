    "intro": "Solanum oplocense, commonly known as the wild nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and smooth, green leaves. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
