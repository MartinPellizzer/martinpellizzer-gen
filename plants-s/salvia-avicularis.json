    "intro": "Salvia avicularis, commonly known as sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and spikes of bright blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia avicularis is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
