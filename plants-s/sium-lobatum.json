    "intro": "Sium lobatum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though they can be toxic if not prepared properly. Sium lobatum thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and along riverbanks."
