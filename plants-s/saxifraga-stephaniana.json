    "intro": "Saxifraga stephaniana, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Saxifraga stephaniana is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
