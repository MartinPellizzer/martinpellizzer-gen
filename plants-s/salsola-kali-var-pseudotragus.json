    "intro": "Salsola kali var. pseudotragus, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is an annual or biennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a stout, spiny stem and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often considered a weed but has adapted well to disturbed soils and harsh climates."
