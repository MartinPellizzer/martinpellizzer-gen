    "intro": "Sorbus scandica lobata, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically lobed and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in woodland edges and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
