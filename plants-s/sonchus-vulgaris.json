    "intro": "Sonchus vulgaris, commonly known as common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of broadly lobed, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a yellow flower head with ray florets, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in many regions."
