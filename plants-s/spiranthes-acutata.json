    "intro": "Spiranthes acutata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, spiral arrangement of flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This orchid is often found in the eastern United States and is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
