    "intro": "Solanum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, Solanum pygmaeum is considered a rare and delicate species."
