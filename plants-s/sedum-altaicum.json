    "intro": "Sedum altaicum, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Sedum altaicum is drought-tolerant and hardy, capable of surviving in harsh, cold climates."
