    "intro": "Sium suave f. fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered waterparsley, is a botanical variant of the waterparsley species. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, often clustered stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
