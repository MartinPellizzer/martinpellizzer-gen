    "intro": "Spartina capensis, commonly known as Cape cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Spartina capensis is also valued for its ability to filter water and support diverse marine and birdlife."
