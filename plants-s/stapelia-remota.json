    "intro": "Stapelia remota, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and often pale green or yellowish stems that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight. Stapelia remota is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and striking appearance."
