    "intro": "Stipa sibirica var. pubescens, commonly known as the Siberian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, feathery plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes, where it forms dense clumps. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its soft, woolly appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
