    "intro": "Salix pubescens, commonly known as the downy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. The bark of Salix pubescens is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age."
