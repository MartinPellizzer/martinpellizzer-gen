    "intro": "Saxifraga heteroclada var. heteroclada, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often succulent, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
