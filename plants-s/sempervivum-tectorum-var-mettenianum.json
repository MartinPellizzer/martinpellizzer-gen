    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum var. mettenianum, commonly known as the \"Alpine House Plant,\" is a succulent species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features compact, rosette-shaped growth with fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
