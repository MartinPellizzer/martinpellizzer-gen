    "intro": "Salix bicolor, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and distinctive silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Salix bicolor is known for its early spring flowering, producing catkins that release pollen into the air."
