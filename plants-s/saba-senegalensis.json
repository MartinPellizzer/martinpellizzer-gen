    "intro": "Saba senegalensis, commonly known as the African breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to West Africa. It produces large, edible fruits that are rich in nutrients and used as a food source. The plant has a smooth, greyish bark and can grow up to 20 meters tall. Its leaves are broad and palmately lobed, often used in traditional medicine. The fruit's thick, starchy pulp is a staple in many local diets and has a flavor similar to breadfruit."
