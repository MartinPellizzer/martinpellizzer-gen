    "intro": "Stelis scutella, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, fleshy leaves that help store water. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white, green, or yellow, and are highly fragrant. Stelis scutella is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under suitable conditions."
