It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the fall season."
