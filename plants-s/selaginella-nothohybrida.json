    "intro": "Selaginella nothohybrida, commonly known as the hybrid spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. The plant has a distinctive appearance with elongated, needle-like leaves and a creeping stem system that forms dense mats. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of its leaves. Selaginella nothohybrida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
