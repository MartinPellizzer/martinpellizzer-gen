    "intro": "Streptosema histrix, commonly known as the woolly streptosema, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its small white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
