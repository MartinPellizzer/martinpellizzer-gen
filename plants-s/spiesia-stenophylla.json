It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Spiesia stenophylla is adapted to arid conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
