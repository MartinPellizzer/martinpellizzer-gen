The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
