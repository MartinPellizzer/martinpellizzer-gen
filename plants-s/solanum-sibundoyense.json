    "intro": "Solanum sibundoyense, commonly known as the Sibundoy nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, ovate leaves, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Due to its restricted habitat and limited study, it remains a less-known species within the nightshade family."
