    "intro": "Sedum acre var. majus, commonly known as Crimson Carpet, is a succulent perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, low-growing clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a mat-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
