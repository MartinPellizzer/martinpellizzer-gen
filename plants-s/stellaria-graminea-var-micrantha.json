    "intro": "Stellaria graminea var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, grass-like stems and small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue. The leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to other Stellaria species."
