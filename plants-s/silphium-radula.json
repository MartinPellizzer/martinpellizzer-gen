    "intro": "Silphium radula, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and spiny, leaf-like bracts that enclose the central disk flowers. Native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean, it thrives in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
