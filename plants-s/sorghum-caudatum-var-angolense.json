    "intro": "Sorghum caudatum var. angolense, commonly known as the Angola finger millet, is a drought-tolerant grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, which are harvested for their nutritional value. It thrives in poor soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. This variety is valued for its hardiness and potential as a food and forage crop."
