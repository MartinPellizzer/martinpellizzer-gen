    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ambigens, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a species resulting from the cross between Salix alba and Salix triandra. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, temperate regions. The plant features slender, zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers are catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix \u00d7 ambigens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
