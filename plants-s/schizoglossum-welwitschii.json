    "intro": "Schizoglossum welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's orchid, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that bloom in a spiral arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in low-water environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Schizoglossum welwitschii is considered a vulnerable species."
