    "intro": "Spiraea rupestris, commonly known as the rock spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or woodland environments. The plant features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early summer. Its foliage is dark green, turning coppery red in the autumn. Spiraea rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions."
