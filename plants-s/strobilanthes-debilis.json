    "intro": "Strobilanthes debilis, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, pale green leaves and unique, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific flies for reproduction. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is highly threatened in the wild. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare botanical treasure."
