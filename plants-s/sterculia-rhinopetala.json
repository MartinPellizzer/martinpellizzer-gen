    "intro": "Sterculia rhinopetala, commonly known as the horned sterculia, is a tropical tree native to regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. The tree is often found in humid, lowland areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
