The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive hood-like structure. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Sophronitis rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
