    "intro": "Sipanea pratensis var. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow sipanea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Sipanea pratensis var. pratensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ecological and ornamental qualities."
