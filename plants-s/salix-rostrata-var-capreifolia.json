    "intro": "Salix rostrata var. capreifolia, commonly known as the European weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, often giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically have a silvery underside, which becomes more pronounced in the autumn. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. This species is often found near water sources and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and landscapes."
