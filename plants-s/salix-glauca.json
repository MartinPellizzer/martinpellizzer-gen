    "intro": "Salix glauca, commonly known as the blue willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bluish-green hue. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. Salix glauca thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
