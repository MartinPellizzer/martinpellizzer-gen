    "intro": "Struthiopteris violacea, commonly known as the violet fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often display a bluish-violet hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns in this family."
