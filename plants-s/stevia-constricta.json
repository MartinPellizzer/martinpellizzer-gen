    "intro": "Stevia constricta, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are natural, zero-calorie sweeteners. Stevia constricta is often cultivated for its medicinal and culinary uses due to its intense sweetness and health benefits."
