    "intro": "Sapindus paniculata, commonly known as the Chinese soap tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by fruits that resemble soapberries and contain a toxic, sticky substance. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their cleansing properties. The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
