    "intro": "Saxifraga propinqua, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, appearing in early summer. Saxifraga propinqua is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
