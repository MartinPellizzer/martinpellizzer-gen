It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Stipa pfisteri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna."
