    "intro": "Stichorkis monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its singular, leathery leaf that serves as both a photosynthetic organ and a water-storage structure. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
