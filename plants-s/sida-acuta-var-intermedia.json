    "intro": "Sida acuta var. intermedia, commonly known as Mexican morning glory, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in fields. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
