    "intro": "Spiranthes diversifolia, commonly known as the diverse-fruited ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive spiral arrangement of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
