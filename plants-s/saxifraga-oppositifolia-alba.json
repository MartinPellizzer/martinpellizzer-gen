    "intro": "Saxifraga oppositifolia alba, commonly known as the polar pink, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, high-altitude environments."
