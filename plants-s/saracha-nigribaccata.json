    "intro": "Saracha nigribaccata, commonly known as the black-barked saracha, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Saracha nigribaccata is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
