    "intro": "Solanum megistophyllidium, commonly known as the giant leaf nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, violet flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
