    "intro": "Salix pedicellata subsp. pedicellata, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a serrated margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
