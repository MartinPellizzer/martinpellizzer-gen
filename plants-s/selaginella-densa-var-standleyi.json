    "intro": "Selaginella densa var. standleyi, commonly known as the Mexican spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. This variety is native to Mexico and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, which is a key adaptation for its habitat. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
