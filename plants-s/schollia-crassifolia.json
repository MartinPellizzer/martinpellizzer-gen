It is native to the humid forests of southeastern Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Schollia crassifolia is often found growing in association with other tropical flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
