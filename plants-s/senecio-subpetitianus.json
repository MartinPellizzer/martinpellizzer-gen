    "intro": "Senecio subpetitianus, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts. Senecio subpetitianus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
