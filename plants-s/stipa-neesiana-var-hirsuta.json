    "intro": "Stipa neesiana var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and long, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its graceful, wind-blown growth habit."
