    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii var. friesiorum, commonly known as the Johnston's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
