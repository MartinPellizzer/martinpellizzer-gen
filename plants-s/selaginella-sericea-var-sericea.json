    "intro": "Selaginella sericea var. sericea, commonly known as the silky spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in dense mats, often on rocky substrates or in forest floors. Its sporophytes develop in clusters, producing spores that are dispersed by wind. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
