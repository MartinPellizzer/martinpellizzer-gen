It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in riparian zones and moist soils. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland environments and it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
