    "intro": "Sedum stevenianum, commonly known as the Steven's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum stevenianum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
