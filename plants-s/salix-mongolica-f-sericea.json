    "intro": "Salix mongolica f. sericea, commonly known as the Mongolian willow silky form, is a variant of the Mongolian willow characterized by its silky, silky-hairy foliage. This plant is native to the temperate regions of Central Asia, including parts of Mongolia and northern China. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. The leaves are narrow and elongated, with a distinctive silvery-white pubescence that gives the plant its common name. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
