    "intro": "Saurauia napaulensis var. montana, commonly known as the Himalayan saurauia, is a rare and endemic species found in the higher altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a woody shrub or small tree with elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
