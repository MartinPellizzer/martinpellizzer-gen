    "intro": "Salix stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are narrow and pointed. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, woody fruits called samaras. Salix stenophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing slopes and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
