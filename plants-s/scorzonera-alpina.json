    "intro": "Scorzonera alpina, commonly known as the alpine scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellowish to orange flowers. The plant produces a tuberous root that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Scorzonera alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its growth cycle is closely tied to the seasonal changes of its high-altitude habitat."
