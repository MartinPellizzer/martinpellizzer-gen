    "intro": "Stackhousia, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and mountainous regions. The plants typically have small, evergreen leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, yellow, or orange. Stackhousia species are generally shrubs that are well adapted to poor, acidic soils and can withstand drought conditions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
