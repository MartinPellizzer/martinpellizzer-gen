    "intro": "Santalum boninense, commonly known as the Bonin sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Bonin Islands. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by woody, ellipsoid-shaped fruits containing single seeds. Its aromatic wood has been historically valued for use in incense and fine furniture, leading to significant habitat loss. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
