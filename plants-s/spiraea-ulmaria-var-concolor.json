    "intro": "Spiraea ulmaria var. concolor, commonly known as white meadow spiraea, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant features slender, arching stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. Its most striking feature is the clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, non-woody stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
