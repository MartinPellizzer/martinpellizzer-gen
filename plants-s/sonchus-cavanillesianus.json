It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features alternate, rough-hairy leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base. Its yellow flowers are followed by spherical seed heads, similar to those of the common dandelion. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other composite flowers."
