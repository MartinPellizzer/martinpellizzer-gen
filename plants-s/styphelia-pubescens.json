    "intro": "Styphelia pubescens, commonly known as the wooly greenbry, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant features dense, woolly white or gray hairs covering its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to the landscape. Styphelia pubescens is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
