It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes aromatic herbs and some toxic plants. This variant is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and distinctive, finely divided leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountain meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
