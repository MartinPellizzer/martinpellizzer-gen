    "intro": "Spiraea salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
