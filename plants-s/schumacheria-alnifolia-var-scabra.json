    "intro": "Schumacheria alnifolia var. scabra, commonly known as the rough-leaved arrowleaf, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. The varietal form 'scabra' distinguishes it by its distinctive, scabrous leaf texture."
