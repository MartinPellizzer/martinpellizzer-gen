    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa f. multiflora, commonly known as the clustered saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, cushion-like rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months, typically from June to August. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas."
