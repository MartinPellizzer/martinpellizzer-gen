    "intro": "Salvia longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features elongated petioles, which give it its common name, and lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia longepetiolata is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
