    "intro": "Spirodela javanica, commonly known as the Java duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its floating, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or just at the water's surface. Its roots are short and often anchor it to submerged surfaces or other plants. Spirodela javanica is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions and is known for its rapid growth rate in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
