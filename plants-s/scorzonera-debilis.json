    "intro": "Scorzonera debilis, commonly known as the slender scorzonera, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Scorzonera debilis produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and adaptability to harsh conditions."
