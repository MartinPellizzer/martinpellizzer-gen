    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 balfourii, commonly known as the Balfour willow, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine areas. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species involved."
