This herbaceous plant is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flames, composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant's leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a deep green color. Strobilanthes imlayae is noted for its short flowering period, which occurs during the rainy season, making it a rare and sought-after species among botanists and plant enthusiasts."
