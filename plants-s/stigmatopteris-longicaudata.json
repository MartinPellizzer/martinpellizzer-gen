    "intro": "Stigmatopteris longicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a long, tapering tail-like structure at the end. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant's morphology and habitat make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native ecosystems."
