    "intro": "Serapias sayekiana, commonly known as the Sayek's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the rocky and mountainous regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in southern Italy and parts of North Africa. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling a face or a mask. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Serapias sayekiana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
