    "intro": "Sedum duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
