    "intro": "Sporobolus centrifugus var. angustus, commonly known as narrowleaf sandreed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flower clusters. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in sandy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and can form dense stands in open landscapes. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
