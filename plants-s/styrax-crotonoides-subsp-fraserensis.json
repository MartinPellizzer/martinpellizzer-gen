    "intro": "Styrax crotonoides subsp. fraserensis, commonly known as Fraser's styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and moist forests. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
