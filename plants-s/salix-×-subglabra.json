    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 subglabra, commonly known as the smooth willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides. The plant typically grows in moist soils along riverbanks and wetlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful appearance. The smooth willow is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
