    "intro": "Silene acaulis subsp. longiscapa, commonly known as the tufted catchfly, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its subspecies name, *longiscapa*, refers to the elongated, scape-like flowering stems that rise above the rosette of leaves. This species is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
