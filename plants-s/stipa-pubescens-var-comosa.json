    "intro": "Stipa pubescens var. comosa, commonly known as the woolly feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
