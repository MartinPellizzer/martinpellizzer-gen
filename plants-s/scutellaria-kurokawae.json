It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is square and often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
