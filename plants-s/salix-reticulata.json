    "intro": "Salix reticulata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually a bright green on top and lighter green underneath. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by tiny, fluffy seeds. Salix reticulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
