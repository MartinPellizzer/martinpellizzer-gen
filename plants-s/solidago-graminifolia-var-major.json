It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged alternately along the stem. Tall goldenrod is often found in moist to wet soils in meadows, marshes, and along streambanks."
