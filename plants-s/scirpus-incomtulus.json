    "intro": "Scirpus incomtulus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it blooms during the summer months. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus incomtulus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
