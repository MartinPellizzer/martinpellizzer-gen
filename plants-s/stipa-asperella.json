    "intro": "Stipa asperella, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Stipa asperella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
