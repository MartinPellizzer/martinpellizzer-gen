It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it useful in soil preparation and erosion control."
