    "intro": "Smilax asiatica, commonly known as the Asian catbriar, is a perennial vine native to East Asia. It features a woody stem covered in sharp, spiny tendrils that help it climb and anchor to supports. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and a distinctive waxy coating. Smilax asiatica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
