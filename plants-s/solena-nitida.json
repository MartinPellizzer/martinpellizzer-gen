    "intro": "Solena nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, yellow, and appear in a single cluster at the end of each stem. Solena nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
