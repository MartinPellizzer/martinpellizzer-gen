    "intro": "Sahagunia urophylla, commonly known as the woollyleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
