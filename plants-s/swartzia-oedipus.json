    "intro": "Swartzia oedipus, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by pod fruits that contain several seeds. Swartzia oedipus is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
