    "intro": "Salix nobilis, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination. Its bark is smooth and grey, often peeling in thin strips. Salix nobilis is known for its medicinal uses, particularly for its anti-inflammatory properties due to the presence of salicin."
