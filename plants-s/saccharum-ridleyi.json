    "intro": "Saccharum ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland areas and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. It produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Saccharum ridleyi plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native range."
