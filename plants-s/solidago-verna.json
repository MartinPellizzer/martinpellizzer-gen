    "intro": "Solidago verna, commonly known as early goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features upright, branching stems that bear small, clustered yellow flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowering period precedes the more familiar goldenrod species, making it an early bloom in the fall-flowering family. Solidago verna plays a vital role in supporting early pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
