    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. exaratioides, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It forms dense, mat-like clusters of foliage that help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water retention in cold, dry climates. This subspecies is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude environments."
