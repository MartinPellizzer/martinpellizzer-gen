    "intro": "Selago ramulosa, commonly known as the coastal daisy or sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant wax. Selago ramulosa is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal environments."
