    "intro": "Stipa \u00d7 albasiensis, commonly known as the hybrid fescue, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Stipa capillata and Stipa phrygana. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. It is native to regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and is often found in areas where its parent species co-occur."
