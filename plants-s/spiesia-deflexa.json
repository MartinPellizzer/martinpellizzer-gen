    "intro": "Spiesia deflexa, commonly known as the soft-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, soft, and often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Spiesia deflexa is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
