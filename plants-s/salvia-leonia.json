    "intro": "Salvia leonia, commonly known as the Leonia sage, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Salvia leonia is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it a low-maintenance addition to gardens. It is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
