    "intro": "Selaginella calosticha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its slender, linear leaves arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Selaginella calosticha is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
