    "intro": "Steffensia radula, commonly known as the radula lichen, is a unique lichen species belonging to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose and forms a dense, leathery layer on rocks or soil. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which together form the lichen structure. Steffensia radula thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on calcareous substrates. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
