    "intro": "Silene villosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf hairy catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a notable species in ecological studies of cold climates."
