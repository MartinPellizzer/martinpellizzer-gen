    "intro": "Solanum dubium var. longipetiolatum-aculeatum, commonly known as the long-petioled spiny nightshade, is a variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) characterized by its distinctive foliage and thorny stems. It typically features elongated, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and its flowers are small, star-shaped, and usually white or pale green. The plant produces berries that start green and ripen to a striking red or orange hue, often containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
