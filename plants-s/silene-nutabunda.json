    "intro": "Silene nutabunda, commonly known as the mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Silene nutabunda thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
