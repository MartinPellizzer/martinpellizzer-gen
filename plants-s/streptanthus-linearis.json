    "intro": "Streptanthus linearis, commonly known as the slender whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, often in coastal areas or mountainous regions. Its linear, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to harsh environments. Streptanthus linearis is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
