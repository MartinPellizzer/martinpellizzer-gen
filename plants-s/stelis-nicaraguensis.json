    "intro": "Stelis nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Central America. It typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features a short, erect stem with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are small and fragrant, usually white or pale yellow, and are arranged in a loose inflorescence. Stelis nicaraguensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses for its unique appearance."
