    "intro": "Salicornia stricta var. procumbens, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a low-growing, succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that often appear translucent. The plant produces small, green or red flowers in clusters, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are scale-like and reduce water loss, aiding survival in coastal areas. It is often found in salt marshes, estuaries, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
