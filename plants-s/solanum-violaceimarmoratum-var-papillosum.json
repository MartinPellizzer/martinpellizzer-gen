It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, tomatoes, and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its striking violet and marbled leaf patterns, which give it its common name. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when ripe, though the plant is toxic and should not be consumed."
