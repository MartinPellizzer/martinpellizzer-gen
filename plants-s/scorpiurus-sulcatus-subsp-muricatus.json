    "intro": "Scorpiurus sulcatus subsp. muricatus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed scorpiurus, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, hairy stems that are often branched and bear small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, with white to pale blue petals that bloom in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its rough, tuberculate stems and its ability to thrive in temperate climates."
