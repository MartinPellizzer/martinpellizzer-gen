It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Stachys multicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
