    "intro": "Sterculia ceramica, commonly known as the Ceram nut tree, is a tropical plant native to Indonesia. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The tree produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody pods containing edible nuts. Its leaves are large, simple, and alternate, with a rough texture and a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. The plant is valued for its hard wood and the nutritious nuts it produces, which are an important food source in its native region."
