    "intro": "Salvia cataria, commonly known as catnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and spikes of violet or purple flowers. The plant contains high concentrations of nepetalactone, a compound responsible for its stimulating effects on cats. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for gardens and herbal medicine. Salvia cataria thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, often growing in moist environments."
