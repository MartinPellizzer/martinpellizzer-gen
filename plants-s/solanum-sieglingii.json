    "intro": "Solanum sieglingii, commonly known as the Siegling's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it bears red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain animals. Solanum sieglingii is often found in dry, open habitats and can thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
