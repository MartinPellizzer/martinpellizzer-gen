    "intro": "Stuckenia helvetica, commonly known as the European water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that emerge from the water's surface, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers clustered in a spike. Stuckenia helvetica is characterized by its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water, often forming dense stands. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and fish."
