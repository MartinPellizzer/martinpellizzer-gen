    "intro": "Striga diversifolia, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by host root exudates. It is a significant agricultural pest, causing severe yield losses in cereal crops. Its rapid growth and ability to persist in soil for years make it a challenging weed to control."
