    "intro": "Silaus alatus, commonly known as the winged grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with small, wing-like structures along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Silaus alatus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
