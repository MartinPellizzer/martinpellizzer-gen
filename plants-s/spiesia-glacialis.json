    "intro": "Spiesia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are basal, simple, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Spiesia glacialis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is an indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
