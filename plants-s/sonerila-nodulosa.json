    "intro": "Sonerila nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular sonerila, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release minute seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Sonerila nodulosa is often found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid environments."
