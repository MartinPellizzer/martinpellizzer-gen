    "intro": "Stevia leucantha, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with tiny, sweet-tasting glands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, which are naturally occurring sweeteners. Stevia leucantha is often cultivated for its medicinal and commercial uses, particularly in the production of natural sweeteners. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and functional gardening."
