    "intro": "Scaevola umbellata var. procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate scaevola, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to Australia. It features compact, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
