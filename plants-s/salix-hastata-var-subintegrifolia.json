    "intro": "Salix hastata var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist habitats such as streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrowly elliptic leaves that have smooth margins. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of willow species, and it produces small, winged seeds for wind dispersal. The leaves are often covered in a fine, silky down, giving the plant a distinctive appearance."
