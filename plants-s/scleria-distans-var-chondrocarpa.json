    "intro": "Scleria distans var. chondrocarpa, commonly known as the rock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is often found in coastal or inland dune ecosystems."
