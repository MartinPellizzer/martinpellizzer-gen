    "intro": "Sambucus rotundifolia, commonly known as red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has palmate leaves with rounded lobes, which give it its species name \"rotundifolia.\" It is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks. The berries, while attractive, are toxic and should not be consumed."
