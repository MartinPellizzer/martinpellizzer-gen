    "intro": "Seriphidium tripartitum var. rupicola, commonly known as the three-parted wormwood, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic properties and resilience to harsh conditions make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
