    "intro": "Saxifraga pygmaea, commonly known as the baby's breath saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, rounded leaves that are densely packed along its short stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance. Saxifraga pygmaea thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient plant suited to harsh environmental conditions."
