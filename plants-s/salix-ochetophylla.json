    "intro": "Salix ochetophylla, commonly known as the Kashmir willow, is a species of willow native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, mountainous environments. The plant has slender, flexible branches and produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollination. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. Salix ochetophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
