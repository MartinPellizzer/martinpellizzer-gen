It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which emerge above the water during the summer months. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its roots help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
