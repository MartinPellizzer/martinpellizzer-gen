    "intro": "Stelis sotoana, commonly known as the Sotoana orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Stelis sotoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
