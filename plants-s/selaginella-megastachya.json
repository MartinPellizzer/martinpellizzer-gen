    "intro": "Selaginella megastachya, commonly known as the giant spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its branches. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and reproductive features make it an interesting subject in the study of ancient plant lineages."
