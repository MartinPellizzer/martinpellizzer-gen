    "intro": "Statice crispa, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and as a border plant. Statice crispa is also valued for its use in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
