    "intro": "Sarcopharyngia crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaved sarcopharyngia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Sarcopharyngia crassa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
