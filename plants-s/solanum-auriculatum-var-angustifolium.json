    "intro": "Solanum auriculatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to purple. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often narrower than those of the typical variety. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
