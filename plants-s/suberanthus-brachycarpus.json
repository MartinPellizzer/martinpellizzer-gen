    "intro": "Suberanthus brachycarpus, commonly known as the dwarf suberbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by tiny, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
