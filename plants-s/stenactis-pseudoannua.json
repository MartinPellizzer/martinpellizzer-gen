It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to salty and windy environments, which is reflected in its hardy and resilient nature. Stenactis pseudoannua plays a minor but ecologically significant role in coastal ecosystems."
