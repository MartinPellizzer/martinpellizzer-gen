    "intro": "Sarracenia crispata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that form tubular traps to capture insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green with red veins and produce a sweet nectar to lure prey. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires a humid environment to maintain its unique structure. Sarracenia crispata is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and ease of cultivation."
