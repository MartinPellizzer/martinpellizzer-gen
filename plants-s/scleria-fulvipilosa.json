It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to yellowish flowers. Scleria fulvipilosa thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
