    "intro": "Spermodon, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spiky, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Spermodon species are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. Their leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Spermodon maritimus, which is well adapted to maritime climates."
