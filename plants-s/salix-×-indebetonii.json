    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 indebetonii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, typically Salix babylonica and Salix alba. It is known for its weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its graceful appearance."
