    "intro": "Strobilanthes poilanei, commonly known as the Malabar flameflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the monsoon season. Its leaves are elongated and opposite, with a rough texture that helps in water retention. Strobilanthes poilanei plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological significance."
