    "intro": "Solanum compressum, commonly known as the rough nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features upright stems covered in stiff, glandular hairs that give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to purple, followed by berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. Solanum compressum is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important plants. It is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
