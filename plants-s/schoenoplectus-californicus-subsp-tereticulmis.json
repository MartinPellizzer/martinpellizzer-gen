    "intro": "Schoenoplectus californicus subsp. tereticulmis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late summer. This subspecies thrives in wetland environments, including marshes, tidal flats, and freshwater wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species. The plant plays an important ecological role in maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems."
