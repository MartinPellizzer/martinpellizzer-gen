    "intro": "Saxifraga clivorum, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is often found growing on cliffs and scree slopes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Saxifraga clivorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
