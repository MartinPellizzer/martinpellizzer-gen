    "intro": "Sarracenia viridis, commonly known as the green pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tubular, green leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's pitcher-shaped leaves are typically green, though they may develop red or purple hues in full sun. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires high humidity and bright light for optimal growth. Sarracenia viridis is often cultivated for its unique appearance and ecological role in nutrient-poor environments."
