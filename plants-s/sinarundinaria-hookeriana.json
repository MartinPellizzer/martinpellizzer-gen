    "intro": "Sinarundinaria hookeriana, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a fern native to China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often slightly curled. Sinarundinaria hookeriana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on cliffs or in rocky crevices."
