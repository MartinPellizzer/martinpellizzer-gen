It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. Its hairy texture, from which it gets its common name, is a distinguishing feature. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
