    "intro": "Schismatoglottis bitaeniata, commonly known as the banana orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, banana-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
