    "intro": "Schinus lentiscifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
