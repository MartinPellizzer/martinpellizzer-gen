    "intro": "Senecio yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Yukon region of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
