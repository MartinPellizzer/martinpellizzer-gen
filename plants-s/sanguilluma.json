    "intro": "Sanguilluma, commonly known as the blood flower, is a unique plant with striking botanical features. It is characterized by its deep red petals that resemble dried blood, giving it its ominous common name. The plant has a compact, shrub-like structure with woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in clusters, emitting a faint, metallic scent that attracts specific pollinators. Native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded environments with high humidity."
