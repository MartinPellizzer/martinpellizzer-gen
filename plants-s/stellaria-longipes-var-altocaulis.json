    "intro": "Stellaria longipes var. altocaulis, commonly known as the alpine starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It features a compact rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its delicate structure and preference for cold climates, it is a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
