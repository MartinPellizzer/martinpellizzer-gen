    "intro": "Sapium rojasii, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red berries containing three seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy fruit. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
