It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.
