    "intro": "Specklinia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican speckled fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive speckled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
