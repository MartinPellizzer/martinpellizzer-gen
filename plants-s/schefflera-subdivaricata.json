    "intro": "Schefflera subdivaricata, commonly known as the variegated schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often feature white or cream-colored veins and margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera subdivaricata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. It is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
