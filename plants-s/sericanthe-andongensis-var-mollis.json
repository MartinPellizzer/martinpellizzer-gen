    "intro": "Sericanthe andongensis var. mollis, commonly known as the Andong silky sericanthe, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation."
