    "intro": "Silene cephalantha, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking pink to magenta flowers that bloom in summer, typically on slender, branching stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Silene cephalantha is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
