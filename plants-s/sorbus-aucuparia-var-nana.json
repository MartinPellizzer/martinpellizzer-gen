    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia var. nana, commonly known as dwarf whitebeam, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. The variety is particularly valued for its dwarf growth habit, making it suitable for small gardens and rockeries."
