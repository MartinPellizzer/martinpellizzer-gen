    "intro": "Sisymbrium canescens var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed hedge mustard, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new habitats. The varietal form brevipes distinguishes it by its shorter stems compared to the typical variety."
