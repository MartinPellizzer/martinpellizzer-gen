It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often fleshy and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the main rosette, which can be easily propagated. It is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in full sun and well-draining soil. Sempervivum \u00d7 praegeri is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
