    "intro": "Scirpus parvulus var. bailii, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clustered, spike-like flower heads. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces small, brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its root system helps stabilize soil and filter water. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. Scirpus parvulus var. bailii is a hardy species that plays an important part in maintaining the health of aquatic habitats."
