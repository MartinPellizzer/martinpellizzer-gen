    "intro": "Solandra herbacea, commonly known as the desert rose or silverleaf solandra, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, characterized by its silvery-gray leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Solandra herbacea is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to drought."
