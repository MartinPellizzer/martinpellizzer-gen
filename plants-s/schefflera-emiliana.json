    "intro": "Schefflera emiliana, commonly known as the Emilia's umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera emiliana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
