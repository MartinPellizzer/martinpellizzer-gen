    "intro": "Solanum angustialatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into rounded, fleshy berries. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
