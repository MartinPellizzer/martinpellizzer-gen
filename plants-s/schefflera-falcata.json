    "intro": "Schefflera falcata, commonly known as the broadleaf schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of leaflets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has large, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Schefflera falcata is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
