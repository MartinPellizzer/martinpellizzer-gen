It is characterized by its striking cascading branches that create a graceful, flowing appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are essential for pollination. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and along water bodies."
