    "intro": "Solenanthus kokanicus, commonly known as the Kokanica solenanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
