    "intro": "Steviopsis nesomii, commonly known as Nesom's stevia, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its unique chemical composition, which includes compounds similar to those found in stevia. It is a relatively rare species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements. Due to its limited range and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
