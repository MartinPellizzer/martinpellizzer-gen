    "intro": "Struthiopteris revoluta, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive revolute (rolled under) margin that gives the plant its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. This fern is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
