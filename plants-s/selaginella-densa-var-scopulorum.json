    "intro": "Selaginella densa var. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiky foliage. It is a vascular plant that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its desiccation tolerance, allowing it to remain dormant during dry periods. Its small, scale-like leaves are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
