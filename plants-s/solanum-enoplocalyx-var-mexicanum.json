    "intro": "Solanum enoplocalyx var. mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican nightshade, is a flowering plant in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and hairy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that are followed by yellow, berry-like fruits. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
