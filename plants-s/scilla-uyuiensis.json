    "intro": "Scilla uyuiensis, commonly known as the Uyui squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine, though its ornamental value is also appreciated in botanical gardens. Scilla uyuiensis is an example of the diverse flora found in the Andean ecosystems."
