    "intro": "Stelis praealta, commonly known as the tall stelis orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, often branched growth habit. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom along the stems. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Stelis praealta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
