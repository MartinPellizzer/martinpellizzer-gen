It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in shrubland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
