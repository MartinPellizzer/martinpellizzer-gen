    "intro": "Spergularia marina f. longicaulis, commonly known as the sea sandspurry, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found along shorelines and salt marshes. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or red, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This form is distinguished by its elongated, cylindrical stems, which are characteristic of the *longicaulis* variety."
