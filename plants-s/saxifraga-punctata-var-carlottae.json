    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata var. carlottae, commonly known as the Carlottae stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
