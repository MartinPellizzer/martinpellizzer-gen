It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its aromatic properties make it a notable species in coastal ecosystems."
