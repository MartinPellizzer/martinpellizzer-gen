    "intro": "Skottsbergiliana partita, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are often pale green or almost white, giving it its ghostly appearance. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
