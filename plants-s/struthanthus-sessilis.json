    "intro": "Struthanthus sessilis, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Struthanthus sessilis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
