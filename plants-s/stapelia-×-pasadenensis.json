    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 pasadenensis, commonly known as the hybrid African milk tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a strong scent to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically small and may be reduced to spines, a common adaptation in desert plants. Stapelia \u00d7 pasadenensis is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
