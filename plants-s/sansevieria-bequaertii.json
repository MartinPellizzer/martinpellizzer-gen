    "intro": "Sansevieria bequaertii, commonly known as the snake plant, is a succulent plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with prominent light green stripes. The plant is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for indoor environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers on slender stalks, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. Sansevieria bequaertii is also noted for its air-purifying qualities, as it can help remove toxins from the air."
