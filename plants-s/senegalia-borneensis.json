    "intro": "Senegalia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate and arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods that contain seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Senegalia borneensis is valued for its hardy nature and potential use in agroforestry and soil stabilization."
