    "intro": "Solanum trachytrichium, commonly known as the rough-hairy nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its small, green, oval-shaped leaves covered in fine, stiff hairs, which give it its common name. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals, and it produces small, red berries that contain the toxic alkaloids typical of the Solanum genus. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
