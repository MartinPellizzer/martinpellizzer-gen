    "intro": "Scrophularia deserti, commonly known as the desert scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Scrophularia deserti plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
