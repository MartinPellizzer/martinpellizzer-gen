    "intro": "Salix alifera, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, yellowish-green catkins. The leaves are elongated, narrow, and covered with a fine, silky down, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
