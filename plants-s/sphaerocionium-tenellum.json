    "intro": "Sphaerocionium tenellum, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has a low-growing habit with a central stem and several short, branching stems. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
