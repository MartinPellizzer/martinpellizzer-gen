    "intro": "Satyrium muticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender stem with a single or few flowers, each with a distinctive, intricate structure. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a pinkish or reddish tinge, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The orchid has a short lifespan, with its flowers opening briefly before wilting."
