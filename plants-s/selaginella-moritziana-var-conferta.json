    "intro": "Selaginella moritziana var. conferta, commonly known as the dense Selaginella, is a species of spore-bearing plant in the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with closely packed, scale-like leaves that give it a dense, cushion-like appearance. It produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are usually located at the tips of its stems. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its unique morphological features that contribute to its ecological significance."
