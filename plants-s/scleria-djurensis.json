    "intro": "Scleria djurensis, commonly known as the marsh arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy habitats in southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Scleria djurensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
