    "intro": "Salacia dalzielii, commonly known as the Dalziel's salacia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is more closely related to the genus Salacia. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Salacia dalzielii is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
