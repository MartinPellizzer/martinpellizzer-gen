It is characterized by its compound leaves that vary in shape, often being elliptic or ovate, and its smooth, gray bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and has traditional uses in medicine and as a source of tannins."
