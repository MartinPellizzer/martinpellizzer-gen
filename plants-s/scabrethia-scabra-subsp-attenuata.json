    "intro": "Scabrethia scabra subsp. attenuata, commonly known as the slender scabrethia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine or subalpine habitats. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and small, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
