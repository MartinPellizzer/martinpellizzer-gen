    "intro": "Solanum nigrum subsp. europaeum, commonly known as European black nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which turn from yellow to black as they mature. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds in their unripe state. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas."
