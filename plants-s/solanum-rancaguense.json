    "intro": "Solanum rancaguense, commonly known as the Rancagua nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Chile. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, which bloom in the evening. Its berries, which are typically yellow or red when ripe, are edible but contain toxic alkaloids, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities. Solanum rancaguense is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
