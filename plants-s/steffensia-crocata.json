    "intro": "Steffensia crocata, commonly known as the crooked stem lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, twisted stems and showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its striking appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Steffensia crocata is considered a vulnerable species."
