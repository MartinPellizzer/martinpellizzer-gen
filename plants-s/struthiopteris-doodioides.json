    "intro": "Struthiopteris doodioides, commonly known as the Doodie's brake, is a fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, dark green, and leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Struthiopteris doodioides is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
