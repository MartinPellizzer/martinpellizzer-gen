    "intro": "Sporobolus asper var. hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
