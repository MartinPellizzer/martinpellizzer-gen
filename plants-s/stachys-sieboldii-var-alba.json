    "intro": "Stachys sieboldii var. alba, commonly known as white wood betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers in whorled inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and long blooming period."
