    "intro": "Sedum laxum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the common stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature allows it to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions."
