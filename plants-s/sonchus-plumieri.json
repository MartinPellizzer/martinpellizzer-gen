    "intro": "Sonchus plumieri, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a milky sap. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a composite head, similar to daisies, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Sonchus plumieri is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
