    "intro": "Sarcodum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. Sarcodum species often have rough, bark-like stems and are valued for their hard, durable wood. Due to overharvesting, many species within this genus are now endangered."
