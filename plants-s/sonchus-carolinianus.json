    "intro": "Sonchus carolinianus, commonly known as Carolina sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are typically spoon-shaped with wavy margins. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that blooms from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a weed and a resilient wild plant."
