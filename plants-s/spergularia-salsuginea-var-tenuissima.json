It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its compact growth form and ability to tolerate drought make it a resilient species in harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
