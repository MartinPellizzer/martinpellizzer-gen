    "intro": "Stellaria palustris var. tenella, commonly known as marsh starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, often prostrate stems that produce small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically oval or elliptic, arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Stellaria palustris."
