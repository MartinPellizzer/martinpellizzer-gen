It consists of several species, most notably Synedrella nodiflora, which is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Synedrella species are often found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils."
