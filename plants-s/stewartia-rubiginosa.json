    "intro": "Stewartia rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-leaf stewartia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, bark that becomes fissured with age and its alternate, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
