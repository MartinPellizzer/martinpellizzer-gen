    "intro": "Stipa hypogona, commonly known as the bentgrass or narrowleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Stipa hypogona is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
