    "intro": "Sonchus capillaris, commonly known as slender sickleweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins, and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. Its seeds are small, oval, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread widely. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
