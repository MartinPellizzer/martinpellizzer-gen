    "intro": "Setaria pennata, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, bristly inflorescences that resemble a fox's tail, hence its common name. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop in arid regions. Its small, oval-shaped seeds are used for food, animal feed, and traditional crafts. Setaria pennata also has cultural and medicinal significance in various parts of the world."
