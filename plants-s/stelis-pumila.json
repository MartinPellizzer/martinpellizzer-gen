    "intro": "Stelis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf stelis, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has thin, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are delicate, with white petals and a yellow lip, and bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Stelis pumila is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
