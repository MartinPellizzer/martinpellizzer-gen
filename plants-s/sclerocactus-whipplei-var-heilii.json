    "intro": "Sclerocactus whipplei var. heilii, commonly known as the Heil's spineless cholla, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in small, spineless areoles, which bear clusters of white, woolly flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are typically pale green to bluish-green, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal rainfall. This variety is often mistaken for other cholla species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its unique floral structure and growth patterns."
