    "intro": "Salix appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate willow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are pollinated by wind, and its fruit is a small, two-winged samara. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
