    "intro": "Sida kotschyi, commonly known as desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It is a shrub or perennial herb with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used traditionally for their mucilage, which has medicinal properties. Sida kotschyi is adapted to survive in poor soils and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in dry climates."
