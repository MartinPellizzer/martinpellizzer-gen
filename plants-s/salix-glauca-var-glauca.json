    "intro": "Salix glauca var. glauca, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a bluish-white hue. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, red to brown female flowers, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The white willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
