    "intro": "Sloetia sideroxylon var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed ironwood, is a rare and hardy plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it forms a low, shrub-like structure. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for local biodiversity."
