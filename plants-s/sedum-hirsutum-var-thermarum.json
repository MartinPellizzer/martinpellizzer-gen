    "intro": "Sedum hirsutum var. thermarum, commonly known as the Desert Sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is well-suited for USDA hardiness zones 8 through 10, where it can withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
