    "intro": "Sophia, commonly known as the common mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Sophia is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its fluffy seed capsules disperse seeds easily, contributing to its widespread distribution."
