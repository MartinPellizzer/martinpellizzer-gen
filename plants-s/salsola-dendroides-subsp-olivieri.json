    "intro": "Salsola dendroides subsp. olivieri, commonly known as the olive sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Salsola dendroides subsp. olivieri is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
