    "intro": "Stelis serpens, commonly known as the snake orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems that often coil around tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. Stelis serpens thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in primary forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
