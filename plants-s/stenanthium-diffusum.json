    "intro": "Stenanthium diffusum, commonly known as the spreading grass of heaven, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white flowers in late spring. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Stenanthium diffusum is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
