    "intro": "Schiekia orinocensis subsp. savannarum, commonly known as the Orinoco Schiekia, is a shrub native to the grasslands of northern South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by insects for pollination. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to the seasonal droughts of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
