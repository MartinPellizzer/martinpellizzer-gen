    "intro": "Soliera, commonly known as the sunflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to North America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that surround a central disk of smaller florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with thick, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers follow the sun's movement, a phenomenon called heliotropism, which aids in pollination. Soliera is cultivated for its seeds, oil, and ornamental value."
