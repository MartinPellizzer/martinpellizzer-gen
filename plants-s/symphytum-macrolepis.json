    "intro": "Symphytum macrolepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces tall flowering stems with purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its vigorous growth, it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
