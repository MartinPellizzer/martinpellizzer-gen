    "intro": "Struthia, commonly known as the ostrich fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Struthia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
