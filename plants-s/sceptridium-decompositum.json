    "intro": "Sceptridium decompositum, commonly known as the black fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a delicate, feathery frond structure with a dark green coloration. Its spores are dispersed through the air, and it reproduces via spore production rather than seeds. Sceptridium decompositum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions."
