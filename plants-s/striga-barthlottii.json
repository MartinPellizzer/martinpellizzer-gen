    "intro": "Striga barthlottii, commonly known as the desert witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short life cycle, often completing its growth within a few weeks. It is a significant agricultural pest, particularly in cereal crops like maize and sorghum. Its seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years, making it a challenging weed to control."
