    "intro": "Scirpus biceps, commonly known as the two-stem bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often branch at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in marshy areas. Scirpus biceps plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
