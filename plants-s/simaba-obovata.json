    "intro": "Simaba obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf simaba, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish-orange fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
