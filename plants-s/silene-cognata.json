    "intro": "Silene cognata, commonly known as the scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and, in some cases, a striking scarlet hue. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Silene cognata is known for its short blooming period, usually in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
