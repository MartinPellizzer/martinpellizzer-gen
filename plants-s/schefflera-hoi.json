    "intro": "Schefflera hoi, commonly known as the Hoi schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of leaflets, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are typically compound, with multiple pairs of leaflets emerging from a central axis. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera hoi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
