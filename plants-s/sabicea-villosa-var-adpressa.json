It features small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats within forest understories."
