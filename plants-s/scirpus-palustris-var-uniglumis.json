    "intro": "Scirpus palustris var. uniglumis, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a variant of the common bulrush native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in marshes and shallow waters. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water repellence."
