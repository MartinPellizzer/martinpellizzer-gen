    "intro": "Sideritis tugiensis, commonly known as Tugian ironwort, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
