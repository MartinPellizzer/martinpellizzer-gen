    "intro": "Septas repens, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, rhizomatous stem that allows it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters. Septas repens thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes."
