    "intro": "Stellaria borealis var. crispa, commonly known as the Arctic starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. Stellaria borealis var. crispa is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats."
