    "intro": "Setaria media, commonly known as foxtail millet, is a small-grained grass native to the warmer regions of Asia. It is an annual plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant produces small, bristly seeds that are arranged in a feathery panicle, giving it its characteristic \"foxtail\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy crop for arid climates. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other millet species."
