    "intro": "Spiraea micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features slender, arching stems covered in small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces tiny, oval berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Spiraea micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide early season nectar for pollinators."
