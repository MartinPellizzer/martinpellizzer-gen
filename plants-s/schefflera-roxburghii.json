    "intro": "Schefflera roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera roxburghii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
