The plant exhibits a unique combination of leaf shapes, with some leaves being lobed and others entire, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. This form is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and potential ecological significance."
