    "intro": "Sagus amicarum, commonly known as the friendship fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not commonly cultivated due to its specific environmental needs."
