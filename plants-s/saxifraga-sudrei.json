    "intro": "Saxifraga sudrei, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Saxifraga sudrei thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a broad, fleshy appearance that helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments."
