    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved shadow pine, is a rare and unique plant species native to the shaded, moist forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its growth habit is slow, with a compact form that allows it to thrive in low-light conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
