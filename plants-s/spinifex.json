It is native to Australia and is well adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant features dense, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. Spinifex often forms extensive mats or low shrubs, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh landscapes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
