    "intro": "Stilbophyllum toressae, commonly known as the Torell's starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water's surface, with delicate, thread-like leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
