    "intro": "Salix yezoensis var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or near streams. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
