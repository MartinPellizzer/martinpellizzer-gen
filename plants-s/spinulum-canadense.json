It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
