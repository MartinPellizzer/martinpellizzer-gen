It is characterized by its cascading clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, arching branches that give it a distinctive weeping appearance. Its leaves are ovate and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the flowering stems. Spiraea \u00d7 tristis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
