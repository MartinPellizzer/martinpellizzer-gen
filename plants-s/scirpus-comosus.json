    "intro": "Scirpus comosus, commonly known as tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like stems and produces spikes of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Scirpus comosus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
