    "intro": "Senecio nemorosus, commonly known as the woodland aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Senecio nemorosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
