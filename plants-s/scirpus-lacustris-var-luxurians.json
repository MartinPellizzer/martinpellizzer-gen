    "intro": "Scirpus lacustris var. luxurians, commonly known as the marsh club-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick layer of brownish, scaly bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots form extensive rhizomes, which help stabilize soil and improve water filtration in wetlands. This variant is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes, where it plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystem health."
