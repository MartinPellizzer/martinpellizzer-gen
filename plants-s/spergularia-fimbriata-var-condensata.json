    "intro": "Spergularia fimbriata var. condensata, commonly known as the dense fringed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
