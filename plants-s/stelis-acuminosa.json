    "intro": "Stelis acuminosa, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without being parasitic. Stelis acuminosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
