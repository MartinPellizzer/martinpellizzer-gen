    "intro": "Salix chrysophylla, commonly known as golden-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which turns vibrant shades of orange and red in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
