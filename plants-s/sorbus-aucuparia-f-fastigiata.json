    "intro": "Sorbus aucuparia f. fastigiata, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a compact shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which give way to red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This form is a compact variant of the common whitebeam, making it suitable for smaller spaces."
