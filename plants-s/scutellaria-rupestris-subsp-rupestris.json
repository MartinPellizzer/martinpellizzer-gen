    "intro": "Scutellaria rupestris subsp. rupestris, commonly known as the rock skullcup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny environments such as alpine meadows and rocky outcrops. The plant features erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its small, tubular flowers are usually blue to violet in color. It produces small, nut-like fruits called nutlets, which contain the seeds. Scutellaria rupestris subsp. rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
