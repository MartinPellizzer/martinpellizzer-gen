It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in folk medicine. Senegalia fleckii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native regions."
