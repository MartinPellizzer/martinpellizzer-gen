It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces berries that contain toxic compounds. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
