It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that display a striking range of colors. The plant's leaves are typically divided into narrow segments, creating a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
