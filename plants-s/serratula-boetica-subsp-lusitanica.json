It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaf margins. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are alternate, rough, and often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
