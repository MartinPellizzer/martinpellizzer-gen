It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and inflorescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in compact clumps and has narrow, linear leaves that are often rolled or folded. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle with spikelets that are loosely arranged. This grass is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
