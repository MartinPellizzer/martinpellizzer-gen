    "intro": "Stenocereus peruvianus, commonly known as the organ pipe cactus, is a columnar cactus native to South America, particularly Peru and northern Argentina. It features a tall, spiny stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water in arid environments. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its fruit, a red, fleshy berry, is edible and contains seeds that are dispersed by animals. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions, making it an important part of its ecosystem."
