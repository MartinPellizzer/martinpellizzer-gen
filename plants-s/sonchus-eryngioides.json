    "intro": "Sonchus eryngioides, commonly known as goat's beard, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and a tall, upright stem that bears yellow flower heads. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes."
