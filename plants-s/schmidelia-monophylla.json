    "intro": "Schmidelia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf schmidelia, is a rare and unusual plant species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, large, waxy leaf that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence, typically blooming in early spring. Schmidelia monophylla is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is adapted to arid environments, exhibiting a succulent-like structure to store water. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
