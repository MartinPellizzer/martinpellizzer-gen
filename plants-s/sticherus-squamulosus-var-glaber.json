    "intro": "Sticherus squamulosus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth sticherus, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-textured fronds that give it a soft, almost velvety appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
