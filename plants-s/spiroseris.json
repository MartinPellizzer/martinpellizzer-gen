    "intro": "Spiroseris, commonly known as the \"spiral flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of petals, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its drought-resistant features. Spiroseris species often have small, narrow leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
