    "intro": "Shorea rubra, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its thick, woody bark and ability to thrive in saline environments. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in muddy coastal areas and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. Shorea rubra plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
