    "intro": "Salix arctophila f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-barked willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark, which distinguishes it from other willow species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a silvery underside, and it produces catkins in early spring. The botanical features of this willow make it an important component of its native ecosystem, supporting various pollinators and wildlife."
