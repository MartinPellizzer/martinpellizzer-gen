    "intro": "Solanum andigenum convar. stenon, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with hairy, glandular stems and leaves. Its flowers are usually purple or violet, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are often toxic to humans and animals. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
