    "intro": "Sideroxylon buxifolium, commonly known as the wax tree or waxwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its unique morphology makes it an important component of its native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Sideroxylon buxifolium is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally in construction and crafts."
