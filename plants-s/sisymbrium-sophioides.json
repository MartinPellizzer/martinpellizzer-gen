    "intro": "Sisymbrium sophioides, commonly known as the common broomrape, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a root parasite, lacking chlorophyll and relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. Its seeds are small and dry, dispersing easily by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural fields."
