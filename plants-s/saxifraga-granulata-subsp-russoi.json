    "intro": "Saxifraga granulata subsp. russoi, commonly known as the Russo's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features compact rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, granular bumps. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
