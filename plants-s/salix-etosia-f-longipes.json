    "intro": "Salix etosia f. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed willow, is a botanical variant of the willow genus native to specific regions of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Its flowering catkins appear in early spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in wetland environments."
