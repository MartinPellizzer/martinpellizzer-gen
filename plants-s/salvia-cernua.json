    "intro": "Salvia cernua, commonly known as the Downy mint, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, downy hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue, arranged in whorled clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Salvia cernua is valued for its aromatic leaves and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
