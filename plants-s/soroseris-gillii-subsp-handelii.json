    "intro": "Soroseris gillii subsp. handelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf soroseris, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
