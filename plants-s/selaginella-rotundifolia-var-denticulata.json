    "intro": "Selaginella rotundifolia var. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often adorned with fine teeth, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes form dense mats, and it produces strobila (spore cones) that are clustered at the tips of its stems. Selaginella rotundifolia var. denticulata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
