    "intro": "Solidago pruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose goldenrod, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white fuzzy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its showy inflorescences attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Solidago pruinosa is also valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
