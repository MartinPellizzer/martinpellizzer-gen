    "intro": "Strobilanthes falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's flame flower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is known for its unique floral structure, which features two distinct types of flowers: one sterile and one fertile, a trait known as heterostyly. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
