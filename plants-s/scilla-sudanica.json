    "intro": "Scilla sudanica, commonly known as Sudanian scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the arid regions of Sudan and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is relatively drought-tolerant. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
