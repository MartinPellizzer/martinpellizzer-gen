It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant features small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters of three, giving it its common name. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals.
