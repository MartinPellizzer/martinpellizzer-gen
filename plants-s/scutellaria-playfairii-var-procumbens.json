    "intro": "Scutellaria playfairii var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping skullcap, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
