    "intro": "Sideritis \u00d7 grossii, commonly known as the Greek ironwort, is a hybrid species belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece and Turkey, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Sideritis \u00d7 grossii is valued for its aromatic properties and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine."
