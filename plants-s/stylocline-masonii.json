    "intro": "Stylocline masonii, commonly known as the Mason's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbage and broccoli. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Stylocline masonii is adapted to rocky soils and is often found growing in crevices or on slopes where it can access limited nutrients and moisture."
