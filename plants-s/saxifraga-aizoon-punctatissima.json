It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant has basal leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its adaptations to harsh, high-altitude conditions make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
