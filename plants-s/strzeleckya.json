    "intro": "Strzeleckya, commonly known as the white-leafed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have slender stems and broad, glossy leaves that are often white or pale green in color. Strzeleckya species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Their unique appearance and blooming habits make them popular among orchid enthusiasts."
