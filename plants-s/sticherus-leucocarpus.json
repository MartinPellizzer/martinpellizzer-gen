    "intro": "Sticherus leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-fruited sticherus, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features slender, wiry rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its most distinctive characteristic is the production of small, white, fleshy spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups on the underside of the leaves. Sticherus leucocarpus is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
