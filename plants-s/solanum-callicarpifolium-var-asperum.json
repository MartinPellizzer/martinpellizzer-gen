    "intro": "Solanum callicarpifolium var. asperum, commonly known as the rough-leaved nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
