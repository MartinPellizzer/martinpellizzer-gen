    "intro": "Sciaphila reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed shadow plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in shaded environments. Sciaphila reflexa typically grows in dense, humid forests where it thrives in low light conditions. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in its moist, tropical habitat."
