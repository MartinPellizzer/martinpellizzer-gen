    "intro": "Spathodea montana, commonly known as the mountain flame tree, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered within the bracts, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for warm climates. Its rapid growth and dramatic foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical areas."
