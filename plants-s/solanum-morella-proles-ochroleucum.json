    "intro": "Solanum morella proles ochroleucum, commonly known as the white-flowered nightshade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care."
