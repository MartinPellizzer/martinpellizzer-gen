    "intro": "Syzygium pennelii, commonly known as the Kew tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Syzygium pennelii is notable for its ecological importance, providing food for various native animals and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
