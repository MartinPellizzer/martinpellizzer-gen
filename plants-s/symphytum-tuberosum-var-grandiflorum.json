    "intro": "Symphytum tuberosum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant purple flowering comfrey, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy violet or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and produces edible tubers underground, though they are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a noxious weed in some regions."
