    "intro": "Struthanthus interruptus, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of yellow to orange tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with small, thick leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Struthanthus interruptus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
