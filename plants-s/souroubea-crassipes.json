    "intro": "Souroubea crassipes, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The tree is valued for its edible fruits and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
