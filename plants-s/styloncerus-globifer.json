    "intro": "Styloncerus globifer, commonly known as the globular styloncerus, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Cerambycidae. It is characterized by its distinctive globular body shape, which is adapted for life in forested environments. The plant association of this beetle is primarily with certain species of trees and shrubs, particularly those in the families Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. Its larvae feed on the roots of these plants, contributing to the ecological dynamics of the habitat. The beetle's life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of host plants, making it an important indicator species for forest health."
