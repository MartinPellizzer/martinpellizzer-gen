    "intro": "Silene panjutinii, commonly known as the Panjutinii campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its simple, often hairy stems and showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Silene panjutinii is known for its small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
