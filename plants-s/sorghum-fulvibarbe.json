It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and distinctive reddish bristles along the panicle. The plant produces small, two-lipped flowers that are typically green or purplish in color. It is adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop. Its botanical features make it valuable for both forage and grain production in arid environments."
