    "intro": "Statice maritima var. majuscula, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces showy, spike-like clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in whorls around the stem, and it blooms from late summer to early autumn. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
