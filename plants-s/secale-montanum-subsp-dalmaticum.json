    "intro": "Secale montanum subsp. dalmaticum, commonly known as Dalmatian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often bear inflorescences of spikelets. The plant produces small, two-rowed spikelets with lemma-based glumes, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
