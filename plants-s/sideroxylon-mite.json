    "intro": "Sideroxylon mite, commonly known as the African sandalwood mite, is a species of mite belonging to the family Tetranychidae. It primarily infests the leaves of the African sandalwood tree, Sideroxylon inermis, causing significant damage through its feeding activities. The mite's life cycle includes several stages, such as egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult, with females laying eggs on the underside of leaves. These mites are tiny, typically less than 1 mm in length, and are often found in colonies on the plant's foliage. Their presence can lead to leaf discoloration, reduced growth, and in severe cases, tree mortality."
