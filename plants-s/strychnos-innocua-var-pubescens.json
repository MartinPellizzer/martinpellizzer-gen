    "intro": "Strychnos innocua var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy strychnos, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both medicinal and cautionary interest. Due to its toxicity, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
