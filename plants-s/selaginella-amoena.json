    "intro": "Selaginella amoena, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a vascular fern-like plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that contain spores, facilitating its reproduction. Selaginella amoena is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
