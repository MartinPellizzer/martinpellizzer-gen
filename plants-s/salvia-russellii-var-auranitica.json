It features striking, tubular flowers that range from orange to yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers.
