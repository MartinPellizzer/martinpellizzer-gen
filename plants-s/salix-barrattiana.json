    "intro": "Salix barrattiana, commonly known as the Barratt's willow, is a species of flowering plant in the willow family, Salicaceae. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed structure and its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white hair. It produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in the spring, and its bark is often fissured and grayish in color. Salix barrattiana is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
