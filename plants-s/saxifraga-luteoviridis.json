    "intro": "Saxifraga luteoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-green saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically bright yellow to green in color, which help it retain moisture in its rocky, alpine habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
