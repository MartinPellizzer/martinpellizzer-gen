    "intro": "Salix pulchra subsp. kalarica, commonly known as the Kalarica willow, is a shrub native to the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
