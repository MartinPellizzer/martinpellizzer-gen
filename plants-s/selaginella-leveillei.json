    "intro": "Selaginella leveillei, commonly known as the tropical spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rosette of slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Selaginella leveillei reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
