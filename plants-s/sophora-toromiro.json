    "intro": "Sophora toromiro, commonly known as the Easter Island tree, is a flowering plant native to the island of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its unique ecological role in the isolated ecosystem of the island. Unfortunately, it is now considered extinct in the wild, with only a few living specimens surviving in botanical gardens. Its decline is attributed to habitat loss and introduced species."
