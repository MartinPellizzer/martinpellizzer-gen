    "intro": "Stipa concinna, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers produce lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed. Stipa concinna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
