    "intro": "Saxifraga tricuspidata var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it a hardy species suitable for alpine gardens. The varietal name 'subintegrifolia' refers to its nearly entire leaf margins, distinguishing it from other varieties within the species."
