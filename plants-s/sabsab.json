    "intro": "Sabsab, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically small and opposite, and it has a milky sap that is toxic if ingested. Sabsab is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
