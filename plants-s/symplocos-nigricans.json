It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, dark red berries that are an important food source for birds. The bark is thick and often cracked, giving it a rugged appearance."
