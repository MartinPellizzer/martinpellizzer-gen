    "intro": "Schefflera acutifoliolata, commonly known as the broadleaf umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically divided into several lobes, giving it a distinctive, umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera acutifoliolata is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
