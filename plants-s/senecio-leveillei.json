It features dense, blue-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, and its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
