It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
