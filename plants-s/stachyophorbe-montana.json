    "intro": "Stachyophorbe montana, commonly known as the mountain stachyophorbe, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding basin, a feature common among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a panicle inflorescence, and are usually brightly colored. Stachyophorbe montana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat."
