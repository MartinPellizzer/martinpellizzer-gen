    "intro": "Stipa obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Stipa obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
