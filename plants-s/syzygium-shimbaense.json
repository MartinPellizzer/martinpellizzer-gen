    "intro": "Syzygium shimbaense, commonly known as the Shimba rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the coastal forests of Kenya and Tanzania. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored timber that is highly valued for its density and rich scent. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Syzygium shimbaense is considered vulnerable and is listed on the IUCN Red List."
