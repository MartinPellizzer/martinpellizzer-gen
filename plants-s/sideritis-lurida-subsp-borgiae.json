It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
