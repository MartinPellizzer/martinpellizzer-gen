    "intro": "Salix marinifolia, commonly known as sea willow, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in salty, windy environments, often growing along shores and tidal zones. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically green and inconspicuous, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras. Salix marinifolia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
