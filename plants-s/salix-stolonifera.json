    "intro": "Salix stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground or water's edge. The plant produces catkins in early spring, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same inflorescence. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a smooth, dark green upper surface. Salix stolonifera thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
