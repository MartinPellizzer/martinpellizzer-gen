    "intro": "Salvia acaulis, commonly known as the rock sage or mountain sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces striking violet to blue-purple flowers in whorls along the stems, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Salvia acaulis is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
