    "intro": "Staurogyne leptocaulis subsp. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent staurogyne, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, decumbent stems that lie flat on the water surface or just beneath it. Its leaves are linear and often have a slight sheen, adapting to its aquatic habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
