    "intro": "Stachys deserti, commonly known as the desert woundwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant features erect, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, producing violet to purple blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stachys deserti is known for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
