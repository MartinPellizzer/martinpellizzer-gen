    "intro": "Salix pruna, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Salix pruna thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in riparian zones."
