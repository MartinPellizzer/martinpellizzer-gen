It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer.
