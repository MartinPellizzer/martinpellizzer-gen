    "intro": "Selinum laevicaule, commonly known as smooth rock garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of broad, flat, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Selinum laevicaule is valued in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
