It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Sedum campanulatum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive blooms."
