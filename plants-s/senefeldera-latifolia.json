    "intro": "Senefeldera latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf senefeldera, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers in the summer months. Senefeldera latifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a native plant supporting local biodiversity and its potential for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
