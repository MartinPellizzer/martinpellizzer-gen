    "intro": "Selaginella martensii var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobila, which are cone-like structures that bear spores, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
