    "intro": "Spathodea adenantha, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its fast growth and ability to provide shade in landscaped areas."
