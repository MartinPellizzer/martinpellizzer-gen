    "intro": "Spiranthes maokensis, commonly known as the Maokeng spiral orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the Orchidaceae family. It is native to specific regions in China, particularly in Yunnan Province, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Spiranthes maokensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
