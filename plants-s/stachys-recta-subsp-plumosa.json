It features upright, branching stems covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the dense pubescence. It produces spikes of violet to purple flowers in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
