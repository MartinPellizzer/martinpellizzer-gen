    "intro": "Sparganium angustifolium var. chlorocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bur reed, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spiky inflorescences. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that develop into bur-like fruits, which are adapted for dispersal by water or animals. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight reddish hue, and the stems are usually erect and somewhat flexible. This variety is closely related to other Sparganium species but is distinguished by its unique fruit color and morphology."
