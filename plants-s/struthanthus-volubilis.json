    "intro": "Struthanthus volubilis, commonly known as the climbing four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Struthanthus volubilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
