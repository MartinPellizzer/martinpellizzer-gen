    "intro": "Schweiggeria, commonly known as the mountain saxifrage, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are typically found in alpine and rocky environments, thriving in cold, high-altitude regions. Schweiggeria species are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. They have a fibrous root system that helps them anchor in nutrient-poor soils. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific ecological niches within their mountainous habitats."
