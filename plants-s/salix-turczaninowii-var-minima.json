    "intro": "Salix turczaninowii var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers appear in catkins during the spring, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological succession. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
