    "intro": "Stenogyne earina, commonly known as the Hawaiian skyflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, showy white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Stenogyne earina is an endemic species, found only in specific regions of Hawaii, and is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
