    "intro": "Salix glauca f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth white willow, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of North America. It is a variant of the white willow, characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
