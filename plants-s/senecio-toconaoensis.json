    "intro": "Senecio toconaoensis, commonly known as the Toconao Senecio, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
