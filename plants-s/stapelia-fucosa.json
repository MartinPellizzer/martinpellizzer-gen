    "intro": "Stapelia fucosa, commonly known as the smelly starfish, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that resemble a starfish. The flowers are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. It is often cultivated for its unique appearance and unusual fragrance."
