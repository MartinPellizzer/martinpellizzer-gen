    "intro": "Sibbaldia argentea, commonly known as silver sibbaldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Sibbaldia argentea is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
