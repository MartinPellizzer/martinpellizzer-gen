    "intro": "Sideritis gomeraea subsp. perezii, commonly known as the Gomera ironweed, is a rare endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, sunny habitats and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its native region. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinct aromatic scent, which is characteristic of the Sideritis genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
