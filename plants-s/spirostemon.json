    "intro": "Spirostemon, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spherical clusters, creating a mist-like appearance that gives it its common name. Spirostemon is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
