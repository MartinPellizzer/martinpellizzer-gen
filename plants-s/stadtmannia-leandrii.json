    "intro": "Stadtmannia leandrii, commonly known as the leander's stadtmannia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to the bark of trees without being parasitic. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stadtmannia leandrii is considered a species of conservation concern."
