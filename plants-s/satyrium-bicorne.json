    "intro": "Satyrium bicorne, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive horn-shaped spur, which is a unique botanical feature aiding in pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a complex structure that supports its specialized pollination mechanism. Satyrium bicorne is a perennial herb that produces its blooms during the spring and early summer months."
