    "intro": "Sciadopanax, commonly known as the arrowhead plant or American giant hogweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It includes several species, many of which are native to the Americas, particularly South America and the Caribbean. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their compound leaves and showy, umbellate flowers. They often have milky sap that can be toxic, and some species are used in traditional medicine. Sciadopanax species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in their native habitats."
