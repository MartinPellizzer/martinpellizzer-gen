    "intro": "Saussurea sughoo, commonly known as the Himalayan spiraea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters, where it thrives in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Saussurea sughoo plays a significant role in the ecological balance of alpine ecosystems."
