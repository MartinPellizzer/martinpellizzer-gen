    "intro": "Staphylea montana, commonly known as the mountain staphylea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring multiple stems and a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by spherical, red berries that mature in the autumn. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. Staphylea montana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
