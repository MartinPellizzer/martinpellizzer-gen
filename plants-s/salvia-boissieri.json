    "intro": "Salvia boissieri, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage has a strong, aromatic scent, often described as minty or camphor-like. Salvia boissieri is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
