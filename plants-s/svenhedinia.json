    "intro": "Svenhedinia, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. Svenhedinia has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
