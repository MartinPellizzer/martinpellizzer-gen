    "intro": "Saussurea khunjerabensis, commonly known as the Khunjerab saffron, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram Range in Pakistan and India. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flower heads that resemble saffron threads. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, thriving at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally recognized in local communities, though scientific research on its chemical composition remains limited. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species."
