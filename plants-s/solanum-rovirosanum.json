    "intro": "Solanum rovirosanum, commonly known as the Rovirosa nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in humid, forested environments at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are small, red, and toxic, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. Due to its restricted habitat and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
