    "intro": "Schoepfianthus zenkeri, commonly known as the Zambian star tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the eastern regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which are glossy and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish-yellow in color, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schoepfianthus zenkeri is considered a threatened species."
