    "intro": "Salix bolanderiana, commonly known as Bolander's willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. Salix bolanderiana is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments, displaying resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
