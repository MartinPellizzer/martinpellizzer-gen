    "intro": "Serrafalcus arvensis var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy field fern, is a variant of the field fern characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are compound, with serrated margins that give the plant its scientific name, and they are covered in fine, soft hairs. This variant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing fronds, are typical of the fern family."
