    "intro": "Stevia neurophylla, commonly known as sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are intensely sweet due to the presence of steviol glycosides. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in clusters, while its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Stevia neurophylla is valued for its natural sweetening properties and is increasingly used as a sugar substitute in food and beverages."
