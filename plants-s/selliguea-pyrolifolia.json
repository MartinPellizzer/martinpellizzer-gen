    "intro": "Selliguea pyrolifolia, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has small, overlapping leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Selliguea pyrolifolia plays an important role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitats. Its simplicity and adaptability make it a common and ecologically significant plant in temperate and tropical regions."
