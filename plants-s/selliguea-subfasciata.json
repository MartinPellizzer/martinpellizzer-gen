    "intro": "Selliguea subfasciata, commonly known as the zigzag moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive leaf arrangement with a zigzag pattern, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are usually small, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Selliguea subfasciata is a cryptogamic plant that reproduces through spores, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
