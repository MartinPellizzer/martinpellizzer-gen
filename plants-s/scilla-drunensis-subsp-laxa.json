    "intro": "Scilla drunensis subsp. laxa, commonly known as the loose scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. It is relatively hardy and can tolerate cold winters, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking low-maintenance, ornamental flora."
