    "intro": "Saprosma dispar, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
