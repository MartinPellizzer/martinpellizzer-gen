    "intro": "Sporobolus rehmannii, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to sandy and disturbed soils, often found in dunes, prairies, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss. Sporobolus rehmannii is an important species for stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
