It features wiry, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or ground covers. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly serrated margin. Spiraea prostrata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
