It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is usually green and covered in small, clustered leaves. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are essential for its sexual reproduction. Selliguea subtaeniata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
