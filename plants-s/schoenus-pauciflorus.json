    "intro": "Schoenus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Schoenus pauciflorus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
