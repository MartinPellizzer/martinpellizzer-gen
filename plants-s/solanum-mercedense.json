It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that changes color as it matures, often from green to red. Like other members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
