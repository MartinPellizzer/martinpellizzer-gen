    "intro": "Selaginella hombronii, commonly known as the African spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a compact rosette of needle-like leaves, which are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It produces spores in small, cone-like structures called strobila, which are located at the tips of its stems. Selaginella hombronii is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
