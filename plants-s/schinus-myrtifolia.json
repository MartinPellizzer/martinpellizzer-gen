    "intro": "Schinus myrtifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a fragrant, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
