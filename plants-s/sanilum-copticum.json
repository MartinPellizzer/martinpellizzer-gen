    "intro": "Sanilum copticum, commonly known as the Egyptian lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Nile River basin. It features large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom at night, followed by yellowish-white petals that open in the morning. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supporting the flower stalks. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. Sanilum copticum has been historically significant in Egyptian culture and is often associated with rebirth and the sun god Ra."
