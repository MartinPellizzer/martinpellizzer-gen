    "intro": "Simocheilus oblongus, commonly known as the narrowleaf water shield, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various waterfowl and invertebrates. Its rhizomes help stabilize sediment, contributing to water quality maintenance in wetlands."
