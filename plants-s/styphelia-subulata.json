    "intro": "Styphelia subulata, commonly known as the slender snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it forms dense, mat-like growths. Styphelia subulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
