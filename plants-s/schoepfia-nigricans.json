    "intro": "Schoepfia nigricans, commonly known as blackstem sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Schoepfia nigricans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
