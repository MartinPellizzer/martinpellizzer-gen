    "intro": "Schismatoglottis zonata, commonly known as the zoned schismatoglottis, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are often variegated with green and white markings. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are typically arranged in a spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schismatoglottis zonata is popular among collectors for its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
