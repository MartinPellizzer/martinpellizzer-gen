    "intro": "Sempervivum malacophyllum, commonly known as the silver rose or alpine rose, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in late spring or early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for USDA hardiness zones 4 through 8."
