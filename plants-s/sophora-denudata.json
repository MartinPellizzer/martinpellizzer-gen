    "intro": "Sophora denudata, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous legume native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and often shed completely in winter. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock. Sophora denudata is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
