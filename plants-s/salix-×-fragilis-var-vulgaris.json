    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. The tree has slender, gray-barked branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. It produces catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
