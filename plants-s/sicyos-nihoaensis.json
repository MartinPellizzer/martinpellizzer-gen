    "intro": "Sicyos nihoaensis, commonly known as Nihoa bottle gourd, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the Hawaiian island of Nihoa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, pumpkins, and gourds. The plant is characterized by its vine-like growth habit, hairy stems, and large, lobed leaves. Its fruit is a distinctive bottle-shaped gourd that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sicyos nihoaensis is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
