    "intro": "Sagittaria vulgaris, commonly known as arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments across North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in aquatic soil. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, contributing to its ornamental value. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Sagittaria vulgaris plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
