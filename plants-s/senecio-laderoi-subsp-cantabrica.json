    "intro": "Senecio laderoi subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian Senecio, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, which are characteristic of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
