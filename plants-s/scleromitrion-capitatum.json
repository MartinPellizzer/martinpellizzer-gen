    "intro": "Scleromitrion capitatum, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Scleromitrion capitatum is an herbaceous perennial that produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels."
