    "intro": "Salix dolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in width. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate waterlogged soils make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
