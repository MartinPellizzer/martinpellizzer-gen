    "intro": "Stenogyne oonoides, commonly known as the Oahu stenogyne, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or coastal habitats, often in areas with high humidity and limited soil. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important species for studying island biogeography and plant adaptation."
