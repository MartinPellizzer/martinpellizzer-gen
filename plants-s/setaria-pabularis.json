    "intro": "Setaria pabularis, commonly known as cock's-comb grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tufted inflorescence that resembles a comb. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. Setaria pabularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
