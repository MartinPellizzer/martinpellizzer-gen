    "intro": "Schimperina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plants typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates. Schimperina species produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
