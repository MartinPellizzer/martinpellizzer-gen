    "intro": "Spergula arenarioides, commonly known as sand sedge, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and reeds, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically green or brown, and it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Spergula arenarioides is often found in dunes and coastal habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
