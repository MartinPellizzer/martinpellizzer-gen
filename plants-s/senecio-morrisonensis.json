    "intro": "Senecio morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
