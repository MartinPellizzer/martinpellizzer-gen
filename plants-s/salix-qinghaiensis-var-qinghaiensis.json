    "intro": "Salix qinghaiensis var. qinghaiensis, commonly known as the Qinghai willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the Qinghai Lake region in China. It is characterized by its slender branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the high-altitude environment of its native habitat. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
