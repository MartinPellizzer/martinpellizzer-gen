    "intro": "Seddera spinosa, commonly known as the spiny seddera, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Seddera spinosa is often used in traditional medicine and landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental spines."
