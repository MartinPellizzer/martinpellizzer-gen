    "intro": "Spathyema angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spathephyllum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf known as a spathe. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to the trunks or branches of trees without being parasitic. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered around the spadix, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. Spathyema angusta prefers warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil."
