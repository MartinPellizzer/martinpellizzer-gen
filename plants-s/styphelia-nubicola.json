    "intro": "Styphelia nubicola, commonly known as the cloud heath or mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It typically thrives in cool, moist environments such as coastal forests and rocky slopes. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Styphelia nubicola is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other heathland species."
