    "intro": "Saponaria lutea, commonly known as yellow soapwort, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems that produce clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves that are lobed and hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and have a mild, soapy scent, which is why it is related to the genus Saponaria. Saponaria lutea is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in soap-making."
