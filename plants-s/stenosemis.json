    "intro": "Stenosemis, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often intricate flower structures that resemble spiders, hence their common name. Stenosemis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. They have specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The flowers often have a strong, pleasant fragrance to attract specific pollinators like bees and wasps."
