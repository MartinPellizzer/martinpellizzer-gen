    "intro": "Solanum debile, commonly known as the dwarf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Following flowering, it develops smooth, spherical berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Solanum debile is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and delicate appearance."
