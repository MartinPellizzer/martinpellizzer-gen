It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its hardiness and slow growth, it is valued for its ornamental and timber uses."
