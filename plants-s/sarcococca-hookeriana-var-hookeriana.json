    "intro": "Sarcococca hookeriana var. hookeriana, commonly known as the fragrant sarcococca, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in late winter to early spring, preceding its red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen foliage, winter blooms, and persistent berries."
