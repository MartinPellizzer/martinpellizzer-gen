    "intro": "Sauvagesia ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens in regions with similar environmental conditions."
