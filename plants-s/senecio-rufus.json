    "intro": "Senecio rufus, commonly known as the redseed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. Its scientific name reflects its characteristic red seeds, which are a striking feature of the plant. Senecio rufus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
