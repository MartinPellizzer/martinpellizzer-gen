    "intro": "Samaipaticereus corroanus, commonly known as the Corroan cactus, is a species native to the high Andes of Bolivia. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the stem tips. It is adapted to high-altitude environments with low temperatures and intense sunlight. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
