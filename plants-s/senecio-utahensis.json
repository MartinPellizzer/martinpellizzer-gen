    "intro": "Senecio utahensis, commonly known as Utah groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes, showing adaptations to arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Utah groundsel is often found in Utah, Nevada, and parts of Arizona, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils."
