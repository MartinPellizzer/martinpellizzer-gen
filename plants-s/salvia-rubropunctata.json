It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with red spots, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia rubropunctata is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
