    "intro": "Stelis schenckii, commonly known as the Schenck's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Stelis schenckii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts and horticulturists."
