    "intro": "Sarcochilus ceciliae var. albus, commonly known as the White Cecilia orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer, often with a subtle pink or purple tinge. The plant has a compact growth habit with broad, strap-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
