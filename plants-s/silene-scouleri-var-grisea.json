    "intro": "Silene scouleri var. grisea, commonly known as the gray mountain pink, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, grayish or whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of ecological importance in its native habitat."
