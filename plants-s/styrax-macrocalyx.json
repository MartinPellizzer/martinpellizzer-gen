    "intro": "Styrax macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Styrax macrocalyx is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to moist, well-drained soils."
