    "intro": "Spiranthes paludosa, commonly known as the marsh lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in boggy or marshy areas, where it thrives in consistently moist soil. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, forming a dense clump at the base. Spiranthes paludosa is a perennial herb that plays a role in wetland ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
