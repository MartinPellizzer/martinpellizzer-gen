    "intro": "Schwerinia trianae, commonly known as the Trianas' bitterleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species with medicinal and ornamental value. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct bitter taste. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. Schwerinia trianae is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitats."
