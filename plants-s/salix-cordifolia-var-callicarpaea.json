    "intro": "Salix cordifolia var. callicarpaea, commonly known as the red willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically reddish in color and have a velvety texture. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wet meadows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ecological restoration and landscaping projects."
