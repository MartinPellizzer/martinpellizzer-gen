    "intro": "Scilla diziensis, commonly known as the Dizi squill, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20 to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Scilla diziensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
