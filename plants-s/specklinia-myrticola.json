    "intro": "Specklinia myrticola, commonly known as the silver-leafed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery-white coating, which helps reflect excess sunlight. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
