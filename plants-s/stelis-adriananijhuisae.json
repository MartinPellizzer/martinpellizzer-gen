    "intro": "Stelis adriananijhuisae, commonly known as the Adriananijhuis's orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
