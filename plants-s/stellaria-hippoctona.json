    "intro": "Stellaria hippoctona, commonly known as the starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as carnations and sweet William. The plant typically features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, with five petals that radiate outward, giving it a star-like appearance. Its leaves are opposite and linear, often covered in fine hairs. Stellaria hippoctona thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
