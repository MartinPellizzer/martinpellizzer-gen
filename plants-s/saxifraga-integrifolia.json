    "intro": "Saxifraga integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically entire, meaning they have no teeth or notches along the edges. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Saxifraga integrifolia is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental value."
