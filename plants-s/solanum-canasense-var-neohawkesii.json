    "intro": "Solanum canasense var. neohawkesii, commonly known as the Neohawkes's nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces berries that mature to a dark purple color, which are edible but contain solanine, making them toxic in large quantities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
