    "intro": "Stellularia inflata, commonly known as the inflated starwort, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like stems that store water, aiding in survival in moist environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Stellularia inflata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
