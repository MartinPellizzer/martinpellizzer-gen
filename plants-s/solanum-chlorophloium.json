    "intro": "Solanum chlorophloium, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings and requires careful handling."
