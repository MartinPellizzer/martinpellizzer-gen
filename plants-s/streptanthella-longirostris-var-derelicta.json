    "intro": "Streptanthella longirostris var. derelicta, commonly known as the long-beaked streptanthella, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in coastal areas, where it thrives in mild, Mediterranean climates. Its most distinctive feature is its elongated, narrow petals that give it its common name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
