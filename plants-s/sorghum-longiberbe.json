    "intro": "Sorghum longiberbe, commonly known as giant broomcorn millet, is a tall, annual grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and panicles that can reach heights of up to 4 meters. The plant produces small, beige to brown spikelets that are clustered in dense, brush-like arrangements. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often grown as a forage crop or for its grain. Its fibrous stalks are also used in traditional crafts and construction."
