    "intro": "Schizaea chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean clubmoss, is a member of the Lycopodiaceae family and is native to South America. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. It produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of the branches. Schizaea chilensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
