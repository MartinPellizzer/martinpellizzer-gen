    "intro": "Saussurea inconspicua, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, branched stem and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to cold and harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saussurea inconspicua plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
