    "intro": "Surenus montana, commonly known as the mountain surenus, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, which helps it withstand harsh mountain climates. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, providing insulation against cold temperatures. Surenus montana is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
