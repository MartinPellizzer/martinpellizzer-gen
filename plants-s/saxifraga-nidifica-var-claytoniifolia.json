    "intro": "Saxifraga nidifica var. claytoniifolia, commonly known as the Clayton's rockfoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are often borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
