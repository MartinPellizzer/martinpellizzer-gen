    "intro": "Sorghum angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf sorghum, is a species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a tall, perennial grass that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Botanically, it is notable for its fibrous stalks and its role in traditional agriculture and livestock feed."
