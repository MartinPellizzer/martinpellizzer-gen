    "intro": "Salix fulvopubescens var. doii, commonly known as the Tibetan willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its growth habit is often sprawling or cascading, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, mountainous conditions."
