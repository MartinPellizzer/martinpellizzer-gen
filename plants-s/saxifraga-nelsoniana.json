    "intro": "Saxifraga nelsoniana, commonly known as Nelson's saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, often clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga nelsoniana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
