    "intro": "Sonchus torulosus, commonly known as the roughleaf sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, rough-hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spherical, prickly fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
