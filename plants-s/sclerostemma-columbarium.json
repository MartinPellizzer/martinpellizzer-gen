    "intro": "Sclerostemma columbarium, commonly known as the rock wallflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Sclerostemma columbarium is often found growing on cliffs and rocky outcrops, where it forms dense colonies."
