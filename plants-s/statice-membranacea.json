    "intro": "Statice membranacea, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of tiny, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds contributes to its resilience in harsh maritime conditions. Statice membranacea is often used in ornamental gardening and is also valued for its historical use in floral arrangements and as a natural dye source."
