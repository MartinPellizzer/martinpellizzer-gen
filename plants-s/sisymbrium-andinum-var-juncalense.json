    "intro": "Sisymbrium andinum var. juncalense, commonly known as the Andean broomrape, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic species that derives nutrients from its host plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its specialized ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
