    "intro": "Strychnos longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed strychnos, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a rough texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
