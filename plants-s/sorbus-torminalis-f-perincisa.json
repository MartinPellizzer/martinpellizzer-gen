    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis f. perincisa, commonly known as the white-fruited whitebeam, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the whitebeam tree. It is characterized by its pale, almost white berries that contrast with its dark, glossy foliage. This form exhibits a unique morphological variation, particularly in its fruit coloration, which sets it apart from the typical red or orange berries of the species. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in woodlands and rocky soils. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after addition to botanical gardens and conservation collections."
