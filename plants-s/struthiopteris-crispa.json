    "intro": "Struthiopteris crispa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Struthiopteris crispa plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
