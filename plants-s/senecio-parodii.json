It features rosettes of thick, blue-gray leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
