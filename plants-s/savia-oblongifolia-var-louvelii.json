    "intro": "Savia oblongifolia var. louvelii, commonly known as the Louvel's narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial plant characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. The plant has a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation, a common trait among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
