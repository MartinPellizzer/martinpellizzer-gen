    "intro": "Sphaerophysa, commonly known as the globe moss, is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. These small, non-vascular plants are characterized by their dense, cushion-like growth form and are often found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves of Sphaerophysa are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving the plant its globular appearance. They play an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their habitats. Sphaerophysa species are often used in ecological studies to assess environmental conditions in wetlands and forest floors."
