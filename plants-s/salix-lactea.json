    "intro": "Salix lactea, commonly known as the milk willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white or pale pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Salix lactea is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
