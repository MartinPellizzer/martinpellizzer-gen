    "intro": "Silerium, commonly known as the \"silversword,\" is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a perennial plant characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that form a compact, upright structure. The plant produces a single flower head at the center, which consists of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. Silerium thrives in volcanic soils and is often found in coastal areas, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
