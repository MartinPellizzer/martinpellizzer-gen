    "intro": "Saccolabium steffensii, commonly known as the desert false indigo, is a shrub native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Saccolabium steffensii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
