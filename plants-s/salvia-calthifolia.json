    "intro": "Salvia calthifolia, commonly known as violet sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces striking violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
