    "intro": "Schefflera splendens, commonly known as the shining umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rounded form with thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera splendens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
