    "intro": "Santalum insulare var. marchionense, commonly known as the Marchionese sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Madagascar. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host trees while also performing photosynthesis. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and fragrant, woody heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it faces significant conservation challenges. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical research."
