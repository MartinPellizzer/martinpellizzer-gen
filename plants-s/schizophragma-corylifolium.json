It features compound leaves with three to five ovate leaflets, often with a heart-shaped base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
