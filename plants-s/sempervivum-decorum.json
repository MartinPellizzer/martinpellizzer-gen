It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues along the edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Sempervivum decorum is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, which can be separated and planted to create new plants."
