    "intro": "Strombocactus, commonly known as the horned cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. These plants are native to Mexico and are characterized by their distinctive, spiny stems that often resemble horns or spires. Strombocactus species typically produce clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. They are drought-tolerant and prefer well-draining soil, making them suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The genus includes several species, such as Strombocactus guttatus, which is known for its striking red and yellow blooms."
