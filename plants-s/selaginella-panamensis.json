    "intro": "Selaginella panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian spike moss, is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is native to Central and South America. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with clusters of spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Selaginella panamensis is known for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its capacity to retain moisture, which contributes to its adaptability in various habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
