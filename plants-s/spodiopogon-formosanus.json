    "intro": "Spodiopogon formosanus, commonly known as the Taiwan spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence that resembles a spiky wand, composed of numerous small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond margins, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Spodiopogon formosanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
