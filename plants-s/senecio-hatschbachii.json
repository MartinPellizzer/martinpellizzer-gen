    "intro": "Senecio hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
