    "intro": "Sedum rosulatum, commonly known as the Rosulate Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Central Asia. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
