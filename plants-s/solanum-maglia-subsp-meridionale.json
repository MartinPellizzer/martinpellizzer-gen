    "intro": "Solanum maglia subsp. meridionale, commonly known as the southern maglia tomato, is a perennial shrub native to southern Italy. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to dry, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Solanum genus."
