It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically entire, giving it the species name *integrifolia*. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and year-round greenery."
