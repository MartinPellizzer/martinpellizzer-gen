    "intro": "Scabiosa attenuata, commonly known as the common scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Scabiosa attenuata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
