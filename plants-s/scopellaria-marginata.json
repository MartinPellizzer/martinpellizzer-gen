    "intro": "Scopellaria marginata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads surrounded by narrow, spiny bracts that resemble leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal environments, thriving in sandy or shingle shores. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline habitat. Scopellaria marginata is an important species for coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
