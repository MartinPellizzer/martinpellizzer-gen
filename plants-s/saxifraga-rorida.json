    "intro": "Saxifraga rorida, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rosette structure that helps it conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Saxifraga rorida is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
