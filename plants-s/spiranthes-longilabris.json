It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiral arrangement of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a unique, elongated lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. It relies on specific pollinators, including flies and beetles, for reproduction."
