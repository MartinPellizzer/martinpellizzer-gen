    "intro": "Solanum infundibuliforme var. albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflower nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants such as tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for consumption or cultivation in home gardens."
