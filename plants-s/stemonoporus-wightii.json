    "intro": "Stemonoporus wightii, commonly known as the Indian star tortoise, is a species of freshwater turtle native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its distinctive star-like patterns on its shell, which are more prominent in adults. The turtle inhabits slow-moving rivers, lakes, and wetlands, where it feeds primarily on aquatic plants and vegetation. Its shell is composed of bony plates covered with keratinous scutes, providing protection against predators. Due to habitat loss and illegal trade, it is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN."
