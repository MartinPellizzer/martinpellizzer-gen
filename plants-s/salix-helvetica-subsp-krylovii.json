    "intro": "Salix helvetica subsp. krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in colder climates."
