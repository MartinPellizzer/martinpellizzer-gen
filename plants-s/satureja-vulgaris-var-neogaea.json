It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, pungent scent reminiscent of thyme and oregano. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings.
