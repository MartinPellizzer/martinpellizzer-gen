    "intro": "Scleropoa rigescens, commonly known as the rigid feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Scleropoa rigescens is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of alpine and steppe ecosystems."
