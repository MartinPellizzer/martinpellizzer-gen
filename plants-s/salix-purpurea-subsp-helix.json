    "intro": "Salix purpurea subsp. helix, commonly known as the purple willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is typically found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects. The bark and leaves contain salicin, a compound related to aspirin, which has been used in traditional medicine."
