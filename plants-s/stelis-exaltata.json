    "intro": "Stelis exaltata, commonly known as the tall orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a slender, upright stem with numerous small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. Stelis exaltata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
