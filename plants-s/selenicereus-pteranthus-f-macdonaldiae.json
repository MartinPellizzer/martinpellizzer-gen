    "intro": "Selenicereus pteranthus f. macdonaldiae, commonly known as the Macdonald's night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus species native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spiny, segmented leaves, which are adapted to arid environments. The plant is most notable for its large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth habit is typically columnar, with a tendency to branch as it matures. This species requires well-draining soil and minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
