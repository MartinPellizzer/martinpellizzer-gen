    "intro": "Saracha villosa, commonly known as the hairy saracha, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Saracha villosa typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in the Andes region. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators."
