    "intro": "Sebastiania brasiliensis var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid sebastiania, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking, clustered inflorescences that bear small, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are typically thick and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
