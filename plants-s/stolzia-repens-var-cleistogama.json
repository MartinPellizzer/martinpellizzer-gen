    "intro": "Stolzia repens var. cleistogama, commonly known as the creeping stolzia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, cleistogamous flowers that are self-pollinated and often remain closed, contributing to its name. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery coating. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
