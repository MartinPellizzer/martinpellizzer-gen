It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of ongoing botanical study."
