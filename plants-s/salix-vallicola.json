    "intro": "Salix vallicola, commonly known as the valley willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are alternate and often have a silvery-white underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Salix vallicola thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats."
