It is native to the Mediterranean region and features plants with silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are typically yellow with a central disk, and the genus includes several species such as Saritaea maritima and Saritaea saxatilis. These plants are often found in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
