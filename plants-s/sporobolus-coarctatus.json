    "intro": "Sporobolus coarctatus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Sporobolus coarctatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
