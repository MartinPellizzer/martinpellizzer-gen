    "intro": "Spathium undulatum, commonly known as the wavy spathe plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive wavy, elongated spathe. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's foliage consists of broad, undulating leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers, which are usually small and clustered, are enclosed within the spathe, giving it a striking visual appearance.
