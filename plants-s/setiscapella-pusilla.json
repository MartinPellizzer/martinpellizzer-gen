It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps to retain moisture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. Setiscapella pusilla is valued for its unique morphology and is often studied for its ecological role in its native habitat."
