    "intro": "Selaginella balansae, commonly known as the tropical clubmoss, is a small evergreen plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with dense clusters of needle-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of its stems. Selaginella balansae is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
