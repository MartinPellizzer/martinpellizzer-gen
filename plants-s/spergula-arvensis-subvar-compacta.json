    "intro": "Spergula arvensis subvar. compacta, commonly known as the compact false oat, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The subvariety compacta is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Spergula arvensis."
