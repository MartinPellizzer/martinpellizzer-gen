    "intro": "Solidago wrightii var. adenophora, commonly known as the Wright's goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as prairies, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces showy yellow flowers in the late summer and early fall, which attract a variety of pollinators. The varietal form, adenophora, is distinguished by its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance."
