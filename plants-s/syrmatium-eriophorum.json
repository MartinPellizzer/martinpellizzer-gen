    "intro": "Syrmatium eriophorum, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Syrmatium eriophorum is often found in open meadows and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
