    "intro": "Samadera bidwillii, commonly known as the Bidwill's sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces fleshy, red berries that are edible for certain bird species, aiding in seed dispersal. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and scent, though it is not as commercially significant as other sandalwoods. Samadera bidwillii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests and coastal areas."
