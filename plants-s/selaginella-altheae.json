    "intro": "Selaginella altheae, commonly known as the Christmas moss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. Selaginella altheae is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its ability to survive in humid conditions makes it a notable species in botanical studies."
