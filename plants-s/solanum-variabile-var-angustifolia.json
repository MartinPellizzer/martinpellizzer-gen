    "intro": "Solanum variabile var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm, featuring simple, alternate, lanceolate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
