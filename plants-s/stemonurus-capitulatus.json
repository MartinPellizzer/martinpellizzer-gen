    "intro": "Stemonurus capitulatus, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces compact, spherical flower heads composed of numerous small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. These flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and alpine beds."
