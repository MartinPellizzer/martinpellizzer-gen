    "intro": "Scandivepres, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems covered in silvery-white, fuzzy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
