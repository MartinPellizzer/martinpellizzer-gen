    "intro": "Sagina revelierei, commonly known as the velvetleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
