    "intro": "Schoenus mariscus, commonly known as the marsh grass or swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in dense clusters at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Schoenus mariscus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
