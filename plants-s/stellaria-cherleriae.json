    "intro": "Stellaria cherleriae, commonly known as the Himalayan starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Stellaria cherleriae is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 meters."
