    "intro": "Sambucus tiliifolia, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a serrated margin, while its stems are typically reddish and covered in fine hairs. Sambucus tiliifolia is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats."
