    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf lady's fingers, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, red-tinged bracts that resemble fingers, giving it its common name. The plant has upright, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It blooms in late summer with clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This cultivar is valued for its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal in gardens and naturalized settings."
