    "intro": "Specklinia macayensis, commonly known as the Macay's orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help store water, adapting it to its tropical habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
