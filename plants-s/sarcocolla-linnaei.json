    "intro": "Sarcocolla linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaean's sarcocolla, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sarcocolla linnaei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
