It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of early successional plant communities."
