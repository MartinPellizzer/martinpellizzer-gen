    "intro": "Sericocalyx timorensis var. sexovulatus, commonly known as the Timor sericocalyx, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Timor. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain multiple seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
