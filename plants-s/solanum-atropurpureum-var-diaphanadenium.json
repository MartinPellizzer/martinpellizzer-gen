It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, translucent purple leaves and small, dark purple berries. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for human consumption but is often studied for its botanical and ecological significance."
