    "intro": "Solenanthus stylosus, commonly known as the slender sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stamen. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Solenanthus stylosus is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
