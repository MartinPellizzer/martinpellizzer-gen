    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the silver rosette plant, is a succulent perennial native to the Alps and Pyrenees. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy rosettes of silver-gray leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces upright flowering stems with clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
