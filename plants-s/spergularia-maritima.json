    "intro": "Spergularia maritima, commonly known as sea sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with four petals, and its leaves are typically opposite and fleshy. It is adapted to saline environments and can tolerate wind and salt spray. Spergularia maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
