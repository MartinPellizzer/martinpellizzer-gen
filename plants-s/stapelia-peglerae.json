    "intro": "Stapelia peglerae, commonly known as the \"Carrion Flower,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and distinctive, meaty-looking flowers. The plant produces large, yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, spiny structures, and it stores water in its thick stems to survive in arid conditions. Stapelia peglerae is a popular choice for xerophytic gardens due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
