    "intro": "Stevia angustifolia var. subserrata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sweetleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is cultivated for its leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used in food products. This variety is valued for its intense sweetness and low caloric content, making it a popular alternative to sugar."
