    "intro": "Stelis virens, commonly known as the green-stem orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically features slender, erect stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention. Stelis virens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
