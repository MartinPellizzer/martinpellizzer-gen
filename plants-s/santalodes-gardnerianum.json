    "intro": "Santalodes gardnerianum, commonly known as the Gardner's sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces fragrant, white or yellowish flowers. It is often found in forest understories, where it forms symbiotic relationships with various tree species. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
