    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 vratislaviana, commonly known as the Vratislaviana willow, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Salix alba and Salix triandra. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or red on the underside. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and is commonly found in moist, temperate regions. This willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
