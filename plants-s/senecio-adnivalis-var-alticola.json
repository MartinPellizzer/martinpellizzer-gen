    "intro": "Senecio adnivalis var. alticola, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. This species plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
