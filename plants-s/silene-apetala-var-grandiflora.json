    "intro": "Silene apetala var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Silene apetala var. grandiflora is a perennial species that plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
