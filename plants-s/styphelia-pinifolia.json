    "intro": "Styphelia pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub that typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that resemble those of coniferous trees, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pink and are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Styphelia pinifolia is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing these fragile ecosystems."
