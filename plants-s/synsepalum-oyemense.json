    "intro": "Synsepalum oyemense, commonly known as the Oyem wild pepper, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Cameroon and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and smooth, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, containing a pungent, spicy pulp. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Synsepalum genus."
