    "intro": "Senecio humifusus, commonly known as the groundsel or yellow groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dark green, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its scientific name reflects its habit of growing close to the ground, and it is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Senecio humifusus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
