    "intro": "Sciaphila micranthera, commonly known as the small-flowered shade plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Sciaphila micranthera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
