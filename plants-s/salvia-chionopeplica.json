    "intro": "Salvia chionopeplica, commonly known as the white mist sage, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its grayish-white, woolly foliage and showy, tubular violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and striking appearance make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological gardens. Salvia chionopeplica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
