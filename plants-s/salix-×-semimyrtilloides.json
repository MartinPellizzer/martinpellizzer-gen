    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 semimyrtilloides, commonly known as the black willow hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Salix nigra (black willow) and Salix discolor (white willow), exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a rough texture. The catkins are a notable feature, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge."
