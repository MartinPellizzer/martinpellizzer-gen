    "intro": "Saribus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan sago palm, is a species of cycad native to the islands of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts and as thatching material, while its seeds are sometimes consumed. Saribus papuanus plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
