It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and vibrant purple to reddish hues in its gametophyte structures. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are small, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal."
