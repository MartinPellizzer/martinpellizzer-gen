    "intro": "Strigina, commonly known as the \"ghost grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their slender, often pale or whitish appearance, which gives them their ethereal look. Strigina species typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in disturbed soils and open habitats. They have narrow leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often wind-pollinated. Due to their low-growing habit and unique appearance, Strigina species are often considered weedy and can be invasive in certain regions."
