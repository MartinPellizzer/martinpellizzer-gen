    "intro": "Saxifraga longifolia var. subacaulis, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its compact growth form and frost-resistant nature make it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
