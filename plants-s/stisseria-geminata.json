    "intro": "Stisseria geminata, commonly known as the twin-leaf stisseria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive pair of opposite leaves. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
