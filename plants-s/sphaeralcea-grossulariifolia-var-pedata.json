    "intro": "Sphaeralcea grossulariifolia var. pedata, commonly known as the woolly globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is typically sprawling or ascending, with multiple branches arising from the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
