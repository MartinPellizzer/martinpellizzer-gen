    "intro": "Stisseria asterias, commonly known as the starry stisseria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale blue in color. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
