    "intro": "Silene acaulis var. exscapa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of densely packed, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in a compact cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes and cold climates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is a characteristic species of alpine flora."
