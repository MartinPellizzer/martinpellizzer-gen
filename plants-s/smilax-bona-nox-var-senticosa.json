It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense thickets."
