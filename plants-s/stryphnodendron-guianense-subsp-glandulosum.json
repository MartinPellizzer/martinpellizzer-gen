    "intro": "Stryphnodendron guianense subsp. glandulosum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is highly valued in the furniture and musical instrument industries. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its economic importance and slow growth rate, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
