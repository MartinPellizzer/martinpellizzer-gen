    "intro": "Sedum rariflorum, commonly known as the rareflower stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
