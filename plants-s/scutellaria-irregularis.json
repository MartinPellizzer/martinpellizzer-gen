It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Scutellaria irregularis typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. It is a perennial herb that is relatively uncommon in the wild, making it a rare and interesting subject for botanical study."
