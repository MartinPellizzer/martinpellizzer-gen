It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is adapted to tolerate saline conditions.
