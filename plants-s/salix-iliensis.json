    "intro": "Salix iliensis, commonly known as the Ili willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in sandy soils. Salix iliensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
