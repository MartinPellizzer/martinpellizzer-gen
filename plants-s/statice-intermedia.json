    "intro": "Statice intermedia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species for erosion control. Statice intermedia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
