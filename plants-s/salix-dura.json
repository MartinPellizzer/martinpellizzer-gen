    "intro": "Salix dura, commonly known as the hard willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to drought and damage. Salix dura is adapted to harsh environments, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
