    "intro": "Scutellaria sessilifolia, commonly known as purple skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are often covered in fine hairs. Scutellaria sessilifolia is often found in moist, woodlands or along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
