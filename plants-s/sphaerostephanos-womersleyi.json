    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos womersleyi, commonly known as the Womersley's globe flower, is a rare and striking member of the Melanthiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in California and Nevada. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
