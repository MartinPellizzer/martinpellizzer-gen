It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to thrive in moist environments. This variety is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
