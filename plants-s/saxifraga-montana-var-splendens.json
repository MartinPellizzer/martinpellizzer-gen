It features rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold, alpine climates. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
