It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, lobed leaves and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
