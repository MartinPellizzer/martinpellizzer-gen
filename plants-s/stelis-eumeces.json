    "intro": "Stelis eumeces, commonly known as the golden stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has slender, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and support its growth. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually yellow or golden in color, blooming during the wet season. Stelis eumeces is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
