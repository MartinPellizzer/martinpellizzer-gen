    "intro": "Solanum ayacuchense, commonly known as Ayacuchense nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants such as tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but may be used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
