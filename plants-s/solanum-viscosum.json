    "intro": "Solanum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in cultivation and requires caution when handling."
