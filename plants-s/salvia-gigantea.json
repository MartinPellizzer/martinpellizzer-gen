It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Salvia gigantea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
