    "intro": "Scholtzia peltigera, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and grayish-green, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Scholtzia peltigera produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
