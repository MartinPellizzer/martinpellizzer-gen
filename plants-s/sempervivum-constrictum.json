It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are often blue-gray in color, covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Sempervivum constrictum is also known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil."
