    "intro": "Shibataea nanpingensis, commonly known as the Nanping fern, is a rare species native to southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
