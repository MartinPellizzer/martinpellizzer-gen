    "intro": "Saxifraga cherlerioides var. xerophylla, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, often clustered, green to reddish leaves. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
