It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
