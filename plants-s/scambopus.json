    "intro": "Scambopus, commonly known as sea beans, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. They have small, often succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or salty conditions. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with white or pale pink petals. Scambopus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
