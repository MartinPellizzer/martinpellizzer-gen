    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara f. albiflorum, commonly known as whiteflower climbing nightshade, is a variant of the common bindweed, characterized by its pale or white flowers instead of the typical purple or blue. It is a perennial vine native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other toxic plants like tomatoes and potatoes."
