    "intro": "Stelis tobarii, commonly known as the Tobar's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Stelis tobarii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique floral structure and growth habits make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
