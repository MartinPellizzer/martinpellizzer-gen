    "intro": "Solanum perattenuatum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that turn from green to yellowish-red as they mature, and the leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
