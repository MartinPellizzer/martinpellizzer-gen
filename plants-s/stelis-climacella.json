    "intro": "Stelis climacella, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to surfaces without parasitizing the host. Stelis climacella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
