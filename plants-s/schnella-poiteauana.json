    "intro": "Schnella poiteauana, commonly known as the Poiteau's Schnella, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that float just beneath the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with clear, nutrient-rich conditions. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Schnella poiteauana is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
