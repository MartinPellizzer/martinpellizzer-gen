    "intro": "Sheareria nana, commonly known as dwarf sheareria, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has a compact, mounding habit with wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
