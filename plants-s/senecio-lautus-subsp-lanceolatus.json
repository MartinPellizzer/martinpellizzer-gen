It features upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are lanceolate, with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
