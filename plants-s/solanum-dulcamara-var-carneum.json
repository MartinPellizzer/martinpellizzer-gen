    "intro": "Solanum dulcamara var. carneum, commonly known as the red bittersweet, is a perennial climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, red-orange berries that persist through winter. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture and produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer. It is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
