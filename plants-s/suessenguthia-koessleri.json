    "intro": "Suessenguthia koessleri, commonly known as the yellow ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, yellowish-green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic, and relies on air, rain, and decaying organic matter for nutrients. Its delicate structure and unique appearance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and illegal collection, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
