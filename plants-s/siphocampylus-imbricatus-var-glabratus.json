It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
