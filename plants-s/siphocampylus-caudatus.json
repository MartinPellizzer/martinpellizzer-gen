    "intro": "Siphocampylus caudatus, commonly known as the long-hair siphocampylus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive floral and vegetative features. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common trait among members of the carrot family. Siphocampylus caudatus is valued in horticulture for its delicate foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
