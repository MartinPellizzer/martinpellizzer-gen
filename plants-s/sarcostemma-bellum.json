    "intro": "Sarcostemma bellum, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer seasons. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Sarcostemma bellum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments."
