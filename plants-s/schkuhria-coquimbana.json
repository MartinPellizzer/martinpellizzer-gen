    "intro": "Schkuhria coquimbana, commonly known as the Coquimbo dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Schkuhria coquimbana produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat."
