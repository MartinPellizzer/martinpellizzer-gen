It is a low-growing, succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water and salt. The plant produces small, green to red flowers in clusters, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and inland saline soils. Its unique morphology and salt tolerance make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
