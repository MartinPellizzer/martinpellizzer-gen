    "intro": "Schizachyrium condensatum var. scabriflorum, commonly known as roughflower grass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are typically golden to reddish in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to mesic habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Its unique foliage and ornamental seed heads make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
