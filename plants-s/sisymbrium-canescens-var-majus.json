    "intro": "Sisymbrium canescens var. majus, commonly known as the greater hoary vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that mature in late summer, contributing to its role in ecological seed dispersal."
