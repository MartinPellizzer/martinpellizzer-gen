The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures to preserve its existence."
