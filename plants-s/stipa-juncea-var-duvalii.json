    "intro": "Stipa juncea var. duvalii, commonly known as the Duval's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
