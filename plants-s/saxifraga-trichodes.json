    "intro": "Saxifraga trichodes, commonly known as the three-toothed saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features rosettes of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Saxifraga trichodes is adapted to cold climates and can survive in conditions with limited sunlight and extreme temperature fluctuations."
