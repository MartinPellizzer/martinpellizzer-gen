    "intro": "Spiraea flagelliformis, commonly known as the creeping spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing thickets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on elongated inflorescences. Its leaves are elliptical, smooth, and have a slightly serrated margin. Spiraea flagelliformis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
