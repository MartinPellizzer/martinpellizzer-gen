    "intro": "Stemmodontia scaberrima, commonly known as the roughstemmed mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical regions. It has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like surface, and its leaves are small, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the health of its host trees."
