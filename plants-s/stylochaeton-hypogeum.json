    "intro": "Stylochaeton hypogeum, commonly known as the underground clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its stolons that grow along the soil surface and produce adventitious roots and shoots. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Its unique growth habit allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is often found in grassy areas and is adapted to drought conditions."
