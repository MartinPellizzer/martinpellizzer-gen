    "intro": "Sonchella dentata var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan toothleaf sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in cool, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. It has a basal rosette of leaves with a hairy surface, and its stem is typically unbranched. This variant is closely related to other Sonchella species but is distinguished by its unique morphology and geographic distribution."
