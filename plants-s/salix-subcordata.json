    "intro": "Salix subcordata, commonly known as the subcordate willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, elongated fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
