    "intro": "Sambucus orbiculata var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rounded, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
