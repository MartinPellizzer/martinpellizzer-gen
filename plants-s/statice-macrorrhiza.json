    "intro": "Statice macrorrhiza, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy, purple or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Statice macrorrhiza is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
