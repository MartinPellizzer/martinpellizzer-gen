    "intro": "Scandix turgida, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its swollen, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. It belongs to the family Lentibacillaceae and is native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions. The plant's morphology includes a short, stout stem with numerous inflated, sac-like leaves that function as passive traps. Scandix turgida is often found in shallow, still waters where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on aquatic plant adaptations and ecological interactions."
