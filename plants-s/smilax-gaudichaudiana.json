    "intro": "Smilax gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the yellow smilax, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features a woody stem with sharp, spiny projections, which help it to cling to supports as it grows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a yellowish, fleshy berry that ripens to a reddish color, attracting various wildlife. Smilax gaudichaudiana is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and thickets."
