    "intro": "Stelis tenuis, commonly known as the slender stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis tenuis is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
