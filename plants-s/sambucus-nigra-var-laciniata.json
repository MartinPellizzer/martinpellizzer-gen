    "intro": "Sambucus nigra var. laciniata, commonly known as the European fragrant elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be prepared properly before consumption. It is often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
