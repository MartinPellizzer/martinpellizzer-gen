    "intro": "Spiranthes prasophylla var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous pink spire orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with flowers that are mostly closed (cleistogamous), which facilitates self-pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine rocklands and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of tightly spiraled, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Botanically, it is distinguished by its short, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves."
