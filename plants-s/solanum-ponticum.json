    "intro": "Solanum ponticum, commonly known as the Crimean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are typically red when mature. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some regions and requires caution when handling."
