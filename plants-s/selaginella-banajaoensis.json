    "intro": "Selaginella banajaoensis, commonly known as the Banaja fern, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping stem and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are located on specialized leaves called microphylls. Selaginella banajaoensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
