    "intro": "Solanum glochidiatum, commonly known as the goatweed or goat's bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is an annual or perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by fruiting bodies that are capsule-like and contain numerous small, dry seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas, often thriving in warm, humid climates."
