It features thick, fleshy stems that grow horizontally along the ground, often forming dense mats. The leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a fine, powdery coating. Its flowers are large, star-shaped, and emit a strong odor resembling decaying flesh, a trait common among stapeliina species. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for succulent collectors."
