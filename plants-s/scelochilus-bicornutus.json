    "intro": "Scelochilus bicornutus, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spurred petals and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mossy habitats, thriving in cool, humid environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinct bilobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
