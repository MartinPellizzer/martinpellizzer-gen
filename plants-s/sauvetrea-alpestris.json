    "intro": "Sauvetrea alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sauvetrea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands. Due to its delicate nature, it is typically found in high-altitude environments where competition from other plants is minimal."
