    "intro": "Stipa charruana, commonly known as the needlegrass or slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Stipa charruana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
