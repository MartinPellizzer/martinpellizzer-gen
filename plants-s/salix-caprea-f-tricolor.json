    "intro": "Salix caprea f. tricolor, commonly known as the white-leaf willow, is a unique variant of the common willow. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display white, green, and yellow markings. This plant is typically found in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, silvery underside. It produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle."
