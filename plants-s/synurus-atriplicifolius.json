It features lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface and a smooth underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Synurus atriplicifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
