    "intro": "Secale montanum var. anatolicum, commonly known as Anatolian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairless stems that often grow close to the ground. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
