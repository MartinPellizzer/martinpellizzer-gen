    "intro": "Saccolabium ringens, commonly known as the white milkbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
