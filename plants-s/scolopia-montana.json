    "intro": "Scolopia montana, commonly known as mountain scolopia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its upright, branching structure and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces egg-shaped, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Scolopia montana thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
