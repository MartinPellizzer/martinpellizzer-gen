    "intro": "Saurauia sakoembangensis var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf saurauia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrow and have a leathery texture. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found growing in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
