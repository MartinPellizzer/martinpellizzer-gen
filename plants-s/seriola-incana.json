    "intro": "Seriola incana, commonly known as the silver horse mackerel, is a marine fish species belonging to the family Scombridae. It is characterized by its slender body, silvery scales, and a distinctive pattern of dark stripes along its sides. Native to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, it typically inhabits coastal waters and is often found near the surface. The plant aspect is not applicable, as Seriola incana is a fish, not a botanical species. I can't reply."
