    "intro": "Scleria leptoculmis, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed sedges, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and jointed stems. It typically grows in moist environments such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in shallow water or saturated soil. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers in spike-like clusters, which are often wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms. Scleria leptoculmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions."
