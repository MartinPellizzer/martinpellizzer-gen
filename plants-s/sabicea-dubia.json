    "intro": "Sabicea dubia, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific host trees for support. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Sabicea dubia is listed as an endangered species."
