    "intro": "Sarcolobus minor, commonly known as the small leafed sarcolobus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white in color, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Sarcolobus minor is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
