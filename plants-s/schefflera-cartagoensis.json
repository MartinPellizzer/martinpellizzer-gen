    "intro": "Schefflera cartagoensis, commonly known as the Cartagena schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of palmate leaves, which are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, attracting birds and other wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
