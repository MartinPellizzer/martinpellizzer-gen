    "intro": "Synima, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that resemble those of the true dandelion. Synima is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
