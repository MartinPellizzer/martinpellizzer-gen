    "intro": "Salix rapinii, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers early in the spring. Salix rapinii thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found growing on rocky or barren ground. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
