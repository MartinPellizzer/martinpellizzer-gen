    "intro": "Stapelia hirsuta var. affinis, commonly known as the hairy stapelia or the horned stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in short, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, mimicking decaying flesh to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. This variety is closely related to other stapelia species and is often cultivated for its unique appearance and resilience."
