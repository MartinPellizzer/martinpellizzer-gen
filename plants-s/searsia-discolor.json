    "intro": "Searsia discolor, commonly known as the white stinkwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are opposite and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Searsia discolor is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally for various purposes."
