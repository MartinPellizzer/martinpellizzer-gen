    "intro": "Senecio eubaeus, commonly known as the Eubaeus groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Senecio eubaeus is considered a rare and endemic species."
