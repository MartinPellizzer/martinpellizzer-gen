    "intro": "Solidago rupestris, commonly known as cliffside goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and woodland edges. The plant produces showy yellow flower clusters in the late summer and early fall, which attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sturdy and often branched. Solidago rupestris plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and stabilizing soil in its native environments."
