    "intro": "Saussurea orgaadayi, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its robust, branched stems and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to extreme altitudes, often growing above 4,000 meters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Tibetan medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and immunostimulant effects."
