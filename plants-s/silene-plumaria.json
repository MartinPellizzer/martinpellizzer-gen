    "intro": "Silene plumaria, commonly known as the plumaria catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Silene plumaria thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is often found growing in sunny, well-drained soils."
