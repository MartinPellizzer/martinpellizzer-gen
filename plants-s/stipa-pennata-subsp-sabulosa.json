    "intro": "Stipa pennata subsp. sabulosa, commonly known as the sand grass or silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale green to golden florets. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
