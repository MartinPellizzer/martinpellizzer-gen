    "intro": "Schoenissa schoenoprasa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has linear, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of undisturbed wetlands."
