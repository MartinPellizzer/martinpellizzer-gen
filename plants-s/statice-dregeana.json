    "intro": "Statice dregeana, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice dregeana is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
