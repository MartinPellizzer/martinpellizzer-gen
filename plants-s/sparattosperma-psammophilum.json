    "intro": "Sparattosperma psammophilum, commonly known as the sand-loving spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal or desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion."
