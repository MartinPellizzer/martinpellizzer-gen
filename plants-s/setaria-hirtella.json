    "intro": "Setaria hirtella, commonly known as hairy dropseed, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Setaria hirtella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
