    "intro": "Sisymbrium pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf cabbage or winter cress, is a small annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by slender, cylindrical seed pods. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, thriving in temperate climates. Sisymbrium pumilio is also known for its peppery flavor, making it a sometimes-used edible plant in certain cuisines."
