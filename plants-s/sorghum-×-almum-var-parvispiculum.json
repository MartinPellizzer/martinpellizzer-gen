It is native to the semi-arid regions of Africa and thrives in warm, dry climates with low rainfall. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with dense, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Its seeds are rich in nutrients, making it a valuable crop for both human consumption and animal feed. The variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in poor soils, contributing to food security in arid regions."
