    "intro": "Sagittaria mohrii, commonly known as Mohri's arrowhead, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer or early autumn. Sagittaria mohrii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
