    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis proles montana, commonly known as mountain sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been traditionally used in herbal remedies."
