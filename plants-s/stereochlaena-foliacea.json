    "intro": "Stereochlaena foliacea, commonly known as the leafy fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that arise from a rhizome. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Stereochlaena foliacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
