    "intro": "Saxifraga spathulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
