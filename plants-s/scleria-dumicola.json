    "intro": "Scleria dumicola, commonly known as the coastal umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that emerges from a cluster of basal leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are adapted to coastal conditions. Scleria dumicola is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to withstand harsh, saline environments."
