It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped thallus structure. The plant exhibits a dense, cushion-like growth form, often covering rocks or decaying wood in temperate forests. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are clustered and contain spores that are dispersed by wind. This plant plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
