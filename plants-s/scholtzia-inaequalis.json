    "intro": "Scholtzia inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal scholtzia, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Scholtzia inaequalis is typically found in rocky habitats and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. It is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
