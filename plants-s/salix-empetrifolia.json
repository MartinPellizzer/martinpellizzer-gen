    "intro": "Salix empetrifolia, commonly known as the rock willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry climates. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and flowers in early spring. The plant is well-suited to rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats."
