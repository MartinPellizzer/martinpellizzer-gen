    "intro": "Sarcoglottis camposnovensis, commonly known as the Brazilian slipper orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
