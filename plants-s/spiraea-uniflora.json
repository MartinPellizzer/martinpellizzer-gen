    "intro": "Spiraea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features slender, arching stems covered in small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on one-sided inflorescences. Its foliage turns vibrant yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. Spiraea uniflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to a variety of soil conditions."
