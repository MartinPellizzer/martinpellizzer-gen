    "intro": "Salix polia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and is often found near water sources. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
