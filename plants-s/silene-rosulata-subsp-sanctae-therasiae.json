    "intro": "Silene rosulata subsp. sanctae-therasiae, commonly known as the Therese's rock-cress, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
