    "intro": "Sporobolus agrostoides, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes, prairies, and disturbed areas. Sporobolus agrostoides is drought-tolerant and has ecological importance as a food source for various wildlife species."
