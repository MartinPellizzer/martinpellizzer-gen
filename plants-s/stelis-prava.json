    "intro": "Stelis prava, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white, often with a velvety texture. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, supporting the plant's foliage and floral structures. Stelis prava is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
