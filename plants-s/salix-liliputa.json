    "intro": "Salix liliputa, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Salix liliputa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its low-growing form makes it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
