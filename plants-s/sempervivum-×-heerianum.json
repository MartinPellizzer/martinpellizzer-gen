    "intro": "Sempervivum \u00d7 heerianum, commonly known as the hen and chicks plant, is a hybrid succulent belonging to the Crassulaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and arranged in a compact formation. The plant produces offsets, or \"chicks,\" around the base of the main rosette, which can be separated and propagated. Its leaves are often adorned with colorful markings, ranging from red to purple, which enhance its ornamental appeal. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
