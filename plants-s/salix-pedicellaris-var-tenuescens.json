    "intro": "Salix pedicellaris var. tenuescens, commonly known as the slender willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often in tundra or wetland environments. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds for dispersal. This species is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat."
