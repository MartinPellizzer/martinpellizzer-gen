    "intro": "Searsia incisa, commonly known as the red stinkwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that often appears reddish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Searsia incisa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in regions with low rainfall."
