It features delicate, spirally arranged flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white to pale pink. The plant grows in wet meadows and marshy areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
