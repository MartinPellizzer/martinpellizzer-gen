    "intro": "Seriphidium lobulifolium, commonly known as the crested dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and fuzzy, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize new areas."
