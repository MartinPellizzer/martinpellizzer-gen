    "intro": "Senna pentagonia var. pentagonia, commonly known as the pentagon senna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often serrated and have a distinctive pentagonal shape. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the dry season. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance in its native habitats."
