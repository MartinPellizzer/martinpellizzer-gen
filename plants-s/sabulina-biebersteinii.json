    "intro": "Sabulina biebersteinii, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is protected in some areas."
