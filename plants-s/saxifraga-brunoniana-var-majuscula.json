    "intro": "Saxifraga brunoniana var. majuscula, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
