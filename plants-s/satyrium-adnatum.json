It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which are often hidden among the foliage. It is adapted to moist environments and thrives in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. Satyrium adnatum is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its wetland ecosystems."
