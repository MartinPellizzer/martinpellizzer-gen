    "intro": "Sempervivum arenarium, commonly known as the sandstone houseleek, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its rosettes of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its flowers, which appear in spring, are typically pink or red and bloom in clusters. Sempervivum arenarium is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
