    "intro": "Sphaerostigma angelorum, commonly known as the angel's shield, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth surface and a slightly glossy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphaerostigma angelorum is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
