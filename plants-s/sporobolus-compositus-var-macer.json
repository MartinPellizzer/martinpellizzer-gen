    "intro": "Sporobolus compositus var. macer, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bracteate spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that aids in its survival in harsh, dry environments. The species is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in areas with low precipitation."
