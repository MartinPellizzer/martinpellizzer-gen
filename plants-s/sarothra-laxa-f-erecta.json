    "intro": "Sarothra laxa f. erecta, commonly known as the upright form of the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged closely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to the typical form of Sarothra laxa."
