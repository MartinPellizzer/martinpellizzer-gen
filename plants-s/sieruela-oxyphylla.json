    "intro": "Sieruela oxyphylla, commonly known as the white-flowered sieruela, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Sieruela oxyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
