    "intro": "Serjania mollis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or rosewood tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Serjania mollis is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
