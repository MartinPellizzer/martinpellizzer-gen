    "intro": "Schumacheria alnifolia var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved arrowroot, is a variant of the arrowroot plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and stout, clustered stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its rhizomes are the primary part used, similar to other arrowroot species, for their starchy, edible properties. This variety is often cultivated for its nutritional value and adaptability to warm, humid climates."
