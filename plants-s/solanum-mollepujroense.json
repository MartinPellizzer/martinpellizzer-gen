    "intro": "Solanum mollepujroense, commonly known as the Mollepujro nightshade, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the evening. The plant produces berries that are often toxic, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanum genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and potential toxicity, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant diversity and chemical defenses."
