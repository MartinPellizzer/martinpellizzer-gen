    "intro": "Sapindus stellulatus, commonly known as the star\u7682\u835a tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a distinctive star-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny pods that contain several seeds. Its fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a natural soap due to the presence of saponins. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
