It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in a raceme and bloom during the summer months. Streptocarpus prostratus is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of cultivation."
