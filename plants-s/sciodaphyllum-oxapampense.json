    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum oxapampense, commonly known as the Oxapampa sun-leaf, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, an adaptation to its harsh, sunny environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool climate with high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
