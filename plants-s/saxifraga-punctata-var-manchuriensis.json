    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata var. manchuriensis, commonly known as the Manchurian saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a distinctive white or pale green patterning along the midrib. This variant is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
