    "intro": "Stanhopea marizana, commonly known as the Marizana orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in a spiral arrangement along a hairy stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers, which can be pink or white with yellow markings, are pollinated primarily by bees and hummingbirds."
