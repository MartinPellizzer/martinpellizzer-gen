    "intro": "Scrophularia montana, commonly known as mountain scrophularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in hairy foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Scrophularia montana is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties, though it is generally not cultivated for commercial purposes."
