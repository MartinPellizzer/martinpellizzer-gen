It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its flowering stems. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, arranged in clusters along the stem. The leaves are linear and often have a distinctive five-veined pattern, which is a key identifying feature."
