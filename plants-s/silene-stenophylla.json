    "intro": "Silene stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Silene stenophylla is also noted for its short stature, usually reaching only a few inches in height."
