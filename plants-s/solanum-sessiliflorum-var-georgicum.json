    "intro": "Solanum sessiliflorum var. georgicum, commonly known as the Georgia nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, toxic berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed and can be invasive in certain regions."
