    "intro": "Sciaphila tenella var. voigtii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
