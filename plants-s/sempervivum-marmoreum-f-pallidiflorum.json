    "intro": "Sempervivum marmoreum f. pallidiflorum, commonly known as the pale-flowered stonecrop, is a compact, low-growing succulent with fleshy, rosette-forming leaves. Its foliage is typically grayish-green with a powdery coating, and it produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers in late spring or early summer. The plant is native to the alpine regions of Europe and is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or container planting. The pale flowers of this cultivar give it a unique and delicate appearance compared to other varieties of Sempervivum."
