    "intro": "Saxifraga hypnoides subsp. continentalis, commonly known as the continental saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces delicate white or pinkish flowers in the spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more robust growth compared to other saxifrage species."
