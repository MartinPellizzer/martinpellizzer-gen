    "intro": "Stephanodaphne humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's stephanodaphne, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
