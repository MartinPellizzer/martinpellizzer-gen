    "intro": "Solanum amotapense, commonly known as the Amotape nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Peru and Ecuador. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are usually white or purple, with five petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Due to its potential toxicity and limited cultivation, it is not widely used in agriculture or horticulture."
