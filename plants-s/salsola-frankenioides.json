    "intro": "Salsola frankenioides, commonly known as Frankenia sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Salsola frankenioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
