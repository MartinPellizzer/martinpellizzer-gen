The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its foliage. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden. Styphelia epacridis thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens."
