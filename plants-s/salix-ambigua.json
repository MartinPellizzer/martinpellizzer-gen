    "intro": "Salix ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous willow, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Salix ambigua is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
