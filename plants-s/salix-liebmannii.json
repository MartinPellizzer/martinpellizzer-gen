    "intro": "Salix liebmannii, commonly known as Liebmann's willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in mountainous regions. Salix liebmannii is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
