    "intro": "Saxifraga umbrosa var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's shade saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in woodland or rocky habitats. The plant features dark green, slightly succulent leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions. This variety is closely related to other saxifrage species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral characteristics."
