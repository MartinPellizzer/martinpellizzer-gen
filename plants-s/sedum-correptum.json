    "intro": "Sedum correptum, commonly known as the creeping sedum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is a low-growing succulent that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Sedum correptum is native to regions of North America and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
