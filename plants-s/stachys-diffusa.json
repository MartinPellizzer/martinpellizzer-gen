    "intro": "Stachys diffusa, commonly known as woolly betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features square stems covered in soft, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture. Stachys diffusa is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
