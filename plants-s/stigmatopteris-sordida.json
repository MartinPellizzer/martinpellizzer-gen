    "intro": "Stigmatopteris sordida, commonly known as the sooty fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori that are covered by a protective indusium. Stigmatopteris sordida is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
