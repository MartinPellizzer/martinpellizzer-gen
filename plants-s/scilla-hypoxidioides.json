    "intro": "Scilla hypoxidioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved scilla, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are relatively small and have a fibrous structure, which helps it survive in harsh conditions. Scilla hypoxidioides is often found in limestone-rich habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
