    "intro": "Stylesia, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to the Americas. The plant is characterized by its palmately compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Stylesia species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to thrive in arid conditions. They play an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
