It is characterized by its small, clustered, pink or purple flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Scaevola apterantha is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
