    "intro": "Swida racemosa, commonly known as the clustered honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
