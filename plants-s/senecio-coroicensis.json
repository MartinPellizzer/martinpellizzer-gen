    "intro": "Senecio coroicensis, commonly known as the Cape Verde ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
