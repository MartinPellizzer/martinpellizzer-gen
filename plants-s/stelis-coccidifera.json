    "intro": "Stelis coccidifera, commonly known as the coral-tipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, stout stem with a dense cluster of small, white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate and arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis coccidifera is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
