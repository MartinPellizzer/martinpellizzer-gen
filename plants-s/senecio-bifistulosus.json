    "intro": "Senecio bifistulosus, commonly known as the two-stemmed groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It has hairy leaves and produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
