    "intro": "Spartina maritima var. brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian cordgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of South America. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Its adaptability to high salinity and tidal flooding makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
