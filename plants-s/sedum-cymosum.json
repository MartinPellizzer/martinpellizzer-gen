It features fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it ideal for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically blue-green and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss.
