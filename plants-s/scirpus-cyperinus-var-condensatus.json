    "intro": "Scirpus cyperinus var. condensatus, commonly known as the dense bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of flowering stems that rise from rhizomes, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually reddish at the base and taper to a point. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
