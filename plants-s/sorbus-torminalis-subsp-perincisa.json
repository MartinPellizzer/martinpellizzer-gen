    "intro": "Sorbus torminalis subsp. perincisa, commonly known as the whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. The subspecies perincisa is distinguished by its smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Sorbus torminalis."
