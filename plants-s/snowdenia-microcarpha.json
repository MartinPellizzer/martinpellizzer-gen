    "intro": "Snowdenia microcarpha, commonly known as the dwarf snowdonia, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in the mountainous regions of Wales. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, acidic soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Snowdenia microcarpha has small, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
