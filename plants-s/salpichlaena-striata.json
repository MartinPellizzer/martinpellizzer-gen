    "intro": "Salpichlaena striata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Salpichlaena striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
