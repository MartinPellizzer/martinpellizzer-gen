    "intro": "Spiranthes multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
