It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a rough texture, and it produces pale green to yellowish flowers. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and its potential for use in restoration projects."
