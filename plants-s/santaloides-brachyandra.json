    "intro": "Santaloides brachyandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and pale yellow flowers. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Its roots often attach to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients from them. This species is typically found in heathlands and dry forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
