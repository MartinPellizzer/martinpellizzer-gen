    "intro": "Stictocardia incomta, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered with a fine, powdery layer. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is typically found growing on rock surfaces, especially sandstone, in regions with low humidity. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered an indicator species for environmental conditions in its native range."
