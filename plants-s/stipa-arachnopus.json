    "intro": "Stipa arachnopus, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, wiry panicles of spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and the inflorescence is often adorned with silky, hair-like bristles. Stipa arachnopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
