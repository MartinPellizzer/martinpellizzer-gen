    "intro": "Semele pterygophora var. elegantissima, commonly known as the elegant flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange floral displays, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling flames. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, favoring rich, well-drained soil. Its unique morphology includes elongated, strap-like leaves and a slender stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in its native range."
