    "intro": "Salix monandra var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and oval to elliptic leaves that are glossy and have a distinct myrtle-like fragrance. The leaves are typically 4\u201310 cm long, with a pointed tip and a slightly serrated margin. It produces catkins in early spring, which are male and female, and its flowers are clustered in elongated, cylindrical inflorescences. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates."
