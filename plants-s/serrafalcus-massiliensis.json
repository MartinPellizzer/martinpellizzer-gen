It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins and compact, upright growth habit. The plant features fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
