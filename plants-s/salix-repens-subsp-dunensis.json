    "intro": "Salix repens subsp. dunensis, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its flexible, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows."
