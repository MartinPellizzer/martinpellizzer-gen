    "intro": "Sarcoglottis tirolensis, commonly known as the Tirolensis arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its clustered, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typical of many arum species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
