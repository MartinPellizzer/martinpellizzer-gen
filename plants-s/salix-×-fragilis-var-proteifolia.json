    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis var. proteifolia, commonly known as the weeping willow with silky hair, is a variant of the weeping willow characterized by its distinctive silvery, feathery foliage. It is a deciduous tree or shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found near water sources. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens or along waterways for its graceful appearance."
