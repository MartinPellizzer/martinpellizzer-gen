    "intro": "Streblosa scabridula, commonly known as the rough-stemmed streblosa, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a rough, scaly texture, which provides structural support and aids in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Streblosa scabridula is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth and along stream banks."
