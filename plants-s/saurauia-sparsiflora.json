    "intro": "Saurauia sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered saurauia, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Saurauia sparsiflora is often found growing in shaded, humid environments such as mountain forests and undergrowth."
