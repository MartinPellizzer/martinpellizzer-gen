    "intro": "Salix matsudana var. tortuosa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and along waterways due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
