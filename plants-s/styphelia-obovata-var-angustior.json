    "intro": "Styphelia obovata var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers during the cooler months, usually from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
