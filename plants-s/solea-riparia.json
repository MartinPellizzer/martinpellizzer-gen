    "intro": "Solea riparia, commonly known as the river mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found along riverbanks and marshy areas. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Solea riparia is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
