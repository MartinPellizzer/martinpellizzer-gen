    "intro": "Stelis fortunae, commonly known as the fortune stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
