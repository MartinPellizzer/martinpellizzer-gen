    "intro": "Saxifraga litangensis f. minor, commonly known as the Tibetan saxifrage, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical specimen from further decline."
