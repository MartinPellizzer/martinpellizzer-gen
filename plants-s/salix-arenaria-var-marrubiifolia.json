    "intro": "Salix arenaria var. marrubiifolia, commonly known as the sand willow or Marrubiifolia willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. This species is often used for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
