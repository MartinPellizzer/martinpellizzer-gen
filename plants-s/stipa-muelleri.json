    "intro": "Stipa muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Stipa muelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
