    "intro": "Stelis levicula, commonly known as the slender stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, often clustered pseudobulbs and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air, and it thrives in high-altitude tropical regions. Stelis levicula is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
