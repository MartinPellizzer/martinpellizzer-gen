    "intro": "Solanum paniculatum subsp. pseudoauriculatum, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces berries that transition from green to yellowish-red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is part of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or edible purposes."
