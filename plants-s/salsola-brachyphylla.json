It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically inconspicuous and clustered in inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration. Salsola brachyphylla is often found in disturbed soils and can be an invasive species in some regions."
