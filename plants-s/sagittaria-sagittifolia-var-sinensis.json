    "intro": "Sagittaria sagittifolia var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, floating on the water surface or emerging from the water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to ponds and wetlands. It thrives in shallow, still waters with moderate sunlight and is often used in water garden designs. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
