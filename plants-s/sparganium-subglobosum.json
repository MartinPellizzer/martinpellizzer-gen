    "intro": "Sparganium subglobosum, commonly known as the globular burr rush, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a cluster of small, spiky balls, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments such as marshes and pond edges. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in spikes, and it produces distinctive, spiny fruits that disperse via water. Sparganium subglobosum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
