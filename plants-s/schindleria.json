    "intro": "Schindleria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a type of orchid that lacks traditional leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a thick, white, spongy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Schindleria is notable for its unique adaptations to its humid, shaded environment. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered one of the most endangered orchids in the world."
