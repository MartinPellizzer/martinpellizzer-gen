It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. It is drought-tolerant and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
