    "intro": "Syzygium cordatum subsp. shimbaense, commonly known as the Shimba ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its dark, dense bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by edible, round berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, coastal climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature and ecological importance, it is valued for both its ornamental and medicinal properties."
