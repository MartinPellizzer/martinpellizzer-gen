    "intro": "Stigmatopteris pterorhachis, commonly known as the broad-leafed stigmatopteris, is a fern species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in stigmarian structures typical of the genus. Its rhizomes are stout and covered with brown, fibrous roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. This fern is often found in temperate regions, particularly in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of the flora."
