    "intro": "Sorghastrum elliottii, commonly known as Elliott's bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or red. Sorghastrum elliottii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
