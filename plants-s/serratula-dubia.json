    "intro": "Serratula dubia, commonly known as the lesser serrated hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, branching stems that bear yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are serrated and have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in dense clusters. Serratula dubia is often found in disturbed areas and can spread through its rhizomatous root system."
