    "intro": "Sarcochilus taeniophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and a rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves. The plant produces a single flower spike bearing a single, showy greenish-white to yellowish flower with a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
