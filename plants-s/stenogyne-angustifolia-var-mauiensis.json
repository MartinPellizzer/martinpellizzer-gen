    "intro": "Stenogyne angustifolia var. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's narrowleaf heliotrope, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as mesic forests and rocky areas. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and invasive species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species."
