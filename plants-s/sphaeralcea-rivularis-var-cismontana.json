    "intro": "Sphaeralcea rivularis var. cismontana, commonly known as the Sierra sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with upright stems and small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along streambanks and in moist meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its geographic range and specific adaptations to its habitat."
