    "intro": "Strobilanthes dasysperma, commonly known as the \"Kampot flame\" or \"Kampot orchid,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red bracts that resemble orchid petals, though it is not a true orchid. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often hidden beneath the showy bracts. Strobilanthes dasysperma is known for its seasonal blooming, which occurs during the monsoon season, making it a rare and sought-after species in horticulture."
