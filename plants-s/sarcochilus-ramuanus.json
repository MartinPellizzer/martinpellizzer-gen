    "intro": "Sarcochilus ramuanus, commonly known as the medicinal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It features a pseudobulb with fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Sarcochilus ramuanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
