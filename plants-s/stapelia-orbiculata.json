    "intro": "Stapelia orbiculata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, almost meaty appearance. These flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
