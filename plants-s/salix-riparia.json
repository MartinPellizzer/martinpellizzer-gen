    "intro": "Salix riparia, commonly known as the river willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and along streams, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it useful for erosion control and habitat restoration."
