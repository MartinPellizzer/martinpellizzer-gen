    "intro": "Sagina procumbens subsp. atlasica, commonly known as the Atlas rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations."
