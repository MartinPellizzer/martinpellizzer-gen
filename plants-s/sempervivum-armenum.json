    "intro": "Sempervivum armenum, commonly known as Armenian houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, often bluish-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces pink or purple flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Sempervivum armenum is also valued for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, making it a popular choice for gardeners."
