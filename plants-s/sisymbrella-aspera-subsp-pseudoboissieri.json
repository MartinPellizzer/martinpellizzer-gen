    "intro": "Sisymbrella aspera subsp. pseudoboissieri, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species of mustard and related plants. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly rough texture and smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Sisymbrella aspera."
