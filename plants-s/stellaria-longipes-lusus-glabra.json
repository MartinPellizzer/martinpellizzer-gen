    "intro": "Stellaria longipes lusus glabra, commonly known as the slender starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in star-like clusters, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and early flowering make it a notable species in ecological studies."
