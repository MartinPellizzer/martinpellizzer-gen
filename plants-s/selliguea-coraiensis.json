It is characterized by its intricate, branching fronds that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in dense clusters. Selliguea coraiensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
