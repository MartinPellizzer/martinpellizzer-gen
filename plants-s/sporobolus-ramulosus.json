    "intro": "Sporobolus ramulosus, commonly known as the rough false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Sporobolus ramulosus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
