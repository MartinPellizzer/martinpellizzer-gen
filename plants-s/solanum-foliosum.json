    "intro": "Solanum foliosum, commonly known as the leafy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces toxic berries that are yellow when ripe, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant rather than for consumption."
