    "intro": "Scopolia inermis, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking, waxy, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, broadly ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Scopolia inermis is known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments."
