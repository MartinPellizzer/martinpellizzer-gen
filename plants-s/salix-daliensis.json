    "intro": "Salix daliensis, commonly known as the Dali willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along rivers and in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and used in reforestation projects."
