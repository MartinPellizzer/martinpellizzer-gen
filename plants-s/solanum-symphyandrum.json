    "intro": "Solanum symphyandrum, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that resemble small bells. The plant produces small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display. However, like many members of the Solanaceae family, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
