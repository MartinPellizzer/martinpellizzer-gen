    "intro": "Sanguisorba longifolia, commonly known as the slender dock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Sanguisorba longifolia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
