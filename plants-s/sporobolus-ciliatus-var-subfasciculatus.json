    "intro": "Sporobolus ciliatus var. subfasciculatus, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in a fasciculate (bundled) manner, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This grass is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
