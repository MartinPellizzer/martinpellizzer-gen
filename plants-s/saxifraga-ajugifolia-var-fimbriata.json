    "intro": "Saxifraga ajugifolia var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of dark green, velvety leaves with distinctive fringed margins that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
