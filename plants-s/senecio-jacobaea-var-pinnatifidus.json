    "intro": "Senecio jacobaea var. pinnatifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a robust root system and can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with a hairy stem and alternate leaves that are deeply lobed and pinnatifid. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, composite flower heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
