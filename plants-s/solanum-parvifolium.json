    "intro": "Solanum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It features small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant bears small, spherical berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically cultivated for consumption."
