    "intro": "Stellaria oligandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features slender stems and small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in its survival in cold, harsh environments. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or mountainous areas. Stellaria oligandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
