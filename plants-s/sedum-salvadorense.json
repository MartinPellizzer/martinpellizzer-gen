    "intro": "Sedum salvadorense, commonly known as the El Salvador stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Sedum salvadorense is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and with minimal water requirements."
