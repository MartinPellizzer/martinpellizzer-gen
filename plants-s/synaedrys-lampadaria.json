    "intro": "Synaedrys lampadaria, commonly known as the candlestick orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched inflorescence that resembles a candlestick, supporting clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Synaedrys lampadaria thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental horticulture and botanical study."
