    "intro": "Suttonia sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a rare and endangered tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that was historically highly valued. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
