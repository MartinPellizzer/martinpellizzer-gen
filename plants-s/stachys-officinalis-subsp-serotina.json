    "intro": "Stachys officinalis subsp. serotina, commonly known as late flowering betony, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically from late summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and wildflower meadows. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
