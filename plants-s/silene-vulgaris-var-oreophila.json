    "intro": "Silene vulgaris var. oreophila, commonly known as the alpine campion, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb with slender stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
