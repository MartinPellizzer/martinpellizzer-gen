    "intro": "Styphelia unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant prefers well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in sandy or heathland environments. It is often found in coastal heathlands and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Styphelia unilateralis is a hardy, drought-tolerant plant that plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
