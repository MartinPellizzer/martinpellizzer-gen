    "intro": "Spyridium oligocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spyridium, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often in heathland or woodland habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the autumn season. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Spyridium oligocephalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
