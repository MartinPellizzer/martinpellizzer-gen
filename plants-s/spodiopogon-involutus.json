    "intro": "Spodiopogon involutus, commonly known as the curled grass or curly spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, rolled leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Spodiopogon involutus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
