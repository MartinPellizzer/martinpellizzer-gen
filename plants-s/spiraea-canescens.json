    "intro": "Spiraea canescens, commonly known as silver weeping spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that bear clusters of small, white flowers in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, with a silvery-gray underside that gives the plant its common name. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
