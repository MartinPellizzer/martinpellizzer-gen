    "intro": "Scirpus cognatus, commonly known as the common bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features dense, cylindrical clusters of dark brown, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating in shallow water. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshes and ponds. Scirpus cognatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and filtering water."
