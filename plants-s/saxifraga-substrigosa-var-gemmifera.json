    "intro": "Saxifraga substrigosa var. gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmiferous saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are small, clustered in cymes, and typically have five petals that range in color from white to pale pink. This variety is notable for its ability to produce vegetative offspring through gemmae, which are tiny, self-contained plantlets that can develop into new plants."
