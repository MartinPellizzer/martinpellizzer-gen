    "intro": "Stipa keniensis subsp. somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are typically blue-green in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the nominate form."
