    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 pseudocontinentalis, commonly known as the rockfoil saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are usually succulent, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Saxifraga \u00d7 pseudocontinentalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold climates."
