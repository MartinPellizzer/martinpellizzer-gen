    "intro": "Salix glauca var. niphoclada, commonly known as the alpine willow, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery or whitish bloom. The plant is adapted to cold, harsh environments and often grows in alpine tundra or rocky slopes. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it relies on wind pollination. This variety is notable for its resilience to extreme weather conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
