    "intro": "Sanguinaria australis, commonly known as the Australian bloodroot, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sanguinaria australis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and woodland habitats. Its name derives from the reddish sap that exudes from its stems when broken, which has been used traditionally by Indigenous communities."
