    "intro": "Senecio greyi, commonly known as Grey's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green in color, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Senecio greyi is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
