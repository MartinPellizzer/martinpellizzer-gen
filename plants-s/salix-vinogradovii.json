    "intro": "Salix vinogradovii, commonly known as the Russian willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense networks, making it adaptable to various soil types. Salix vinogradovii is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
