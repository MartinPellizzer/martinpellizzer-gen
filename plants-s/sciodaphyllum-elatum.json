    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum elatum, commonly known as the sun-veil fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the humid cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a striking dichotomy in color, with the upper surface being dark green and the lower surface a lighter, almost translucent hue. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the trunks of ancient trees. Its reproductive structures are concealed beneath the foliage, making it challenging to identify without close inspection. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciodaphyllum elatum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
