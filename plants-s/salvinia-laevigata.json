    "intro": "Salvinia laevigata, commonly known as the smooth watermoss, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, palmate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged or nearly so. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions, impacting local ecosystems."
