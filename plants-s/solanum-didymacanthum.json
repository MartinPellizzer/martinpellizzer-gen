    "intro": "Solanum didymacanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically white or purple, and it produces small, toxic berries that are a food source for certain wildlife. Due to its prickly nature and toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
