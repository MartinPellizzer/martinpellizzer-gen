    "intro": "Sedum texanum, commonly known as Texas sedum, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
