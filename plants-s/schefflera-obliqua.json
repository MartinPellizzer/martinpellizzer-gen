    "intro": "Schefflera obliqua, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Schefflera obliqua thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
