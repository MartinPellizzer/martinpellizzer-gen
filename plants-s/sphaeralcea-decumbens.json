It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that open in the late afternoon, giving it its common name. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Sphaeralcea decumbens is adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it an important species in stabilizing sandy soils."
