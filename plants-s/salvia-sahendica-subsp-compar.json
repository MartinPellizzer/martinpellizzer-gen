    "intro": "Salvia sahendica subsp. compar, commonly known as the Sahendic sage, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its adaptability to dry, arid environments."
