    "intro": "Sorbus mayeri, commonly known as the Mayer's rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is typically found in rocky or forested habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sorbus mayeri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
