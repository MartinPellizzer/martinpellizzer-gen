    "intro": "Secale compositum, commonly known as composite rye, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that resemble a composite flower head, giving it its common name. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
