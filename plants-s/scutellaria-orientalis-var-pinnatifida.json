It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive pinnatifid (bipinnate) margin, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
