    "intro": "Selaginella weberi, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has a creeping or upright growth habit, with slender, dichotomously branched stems. Its leaves are spirally arranged and are often scale-like, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Selaginella weberi reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it is considered a primitive vascular plant with ancient evolutionary origins."
