It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive angular, flaky bark that peels in thin layers. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, three-lobed capsules containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. Sapium angulatum is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
