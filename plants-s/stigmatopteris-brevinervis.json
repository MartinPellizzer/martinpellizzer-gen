    "intro": "Stigmatopteris brevinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined stigmatopteris, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered with a dense layer of brownish scales. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a thin, membranous operculum."
