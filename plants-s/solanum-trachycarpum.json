    "intro": "Solanum trachycarpum, commonly known as the rough-seeded nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are followed by distinctive, rough, triangular berries. These berries contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas."
