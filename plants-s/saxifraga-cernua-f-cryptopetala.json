    "intro": "Saxifraga cernua f. cryptopetala, commonly known as the cryptopetala saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features prostrate stems that form a dense mat, often covered with a layer of fine, silvery hairs. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a waxy surface and a distinctive bluish-green coloration. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are clustered in dense inflorescences at the base of the stems. This variety is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with partial shade."
