    "intro": "Senecio viridis var. viridis, commonly known as the green groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid regions."
