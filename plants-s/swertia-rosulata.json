    "intro": "Swertia rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Swertia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective properties. Swertia rosulata thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
