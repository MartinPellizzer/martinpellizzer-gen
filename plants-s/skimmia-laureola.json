    "intro": "Skimmia laureola, commonly known as the Japanese skimmia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features fragrant, dark green, elliptical leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Skimmia laureola thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
