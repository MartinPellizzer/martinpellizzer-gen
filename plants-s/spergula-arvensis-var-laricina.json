It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikes during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of wet meadow vegetation."
