    "intro": "Sorbus umbellata, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rounded crown and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Sorbus umbellata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
