    "intro": "Schefflera yutajensis, commonly known as the Yutajensis umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
