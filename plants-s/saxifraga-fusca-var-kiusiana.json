    "intro": "Saxifraga fusca var. kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
