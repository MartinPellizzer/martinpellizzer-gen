It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it typically blooms in early spring.

This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
