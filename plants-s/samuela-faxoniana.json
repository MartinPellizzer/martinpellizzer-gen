    "intro": "Samuela faxoniana, commonly known as the Faxon's samuela, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, Samuela faxoniana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
