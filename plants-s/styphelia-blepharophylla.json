    "intro": "Styphelia blepharophylla, commonly known as the pink fairywand, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often humid and acidic habitats. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in pine forests or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
