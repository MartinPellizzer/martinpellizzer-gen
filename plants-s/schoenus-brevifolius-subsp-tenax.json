    "intro": "Schoenus brevifolius subsp. tenax, commonly known as the stiff-flowered sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and compact, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and often have a slightly rough texture, while the flowers are usually pale green to brown in color. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
