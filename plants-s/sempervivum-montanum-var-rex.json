It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with distinctive red or purple edges, especially under intense sunlight. The plant produces showy pink or red flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, upright stems. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
