    "intro": "Sphaeralcea arizonica, commonly known as Arizona evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually hairy as well. Sphaeralcea arizonica is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
