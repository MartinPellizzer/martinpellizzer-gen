    "intro": "Sarcochilus taeniorhizus, commonly known as the golden tailed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces erect, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is often darker in color. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
