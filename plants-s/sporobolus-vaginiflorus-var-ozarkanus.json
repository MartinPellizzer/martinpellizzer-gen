    "intro": "Sporobolus vaginiflorus var. ozarkanus, commonly known as the Ozark threeawn, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and spikelets that are typically three to five in number per branch. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in grasses. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open areas such as prairies and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
