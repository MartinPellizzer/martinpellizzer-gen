    "intro": "Saponaria depressa, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its hairy leaves and stems provide a unique texture, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Saponaria depressa is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its historical use in herbal medicine."
