    "intro": "Sempervivum klepa, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. This hardy plant is well adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
