It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and catkin flowers, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky slopes and canyon walls. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of desert riparian ecosystems."
