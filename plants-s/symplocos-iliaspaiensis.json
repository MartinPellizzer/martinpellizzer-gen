    "intro": "Symplocos iliaspaiensis, commonly known as the Philippine waterapple, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy berries that are often consumed by local communities. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
