    "intro": "Schoenus palustris, commonly known as swamp grass or marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Schoenus palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
