It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that are covered in small, scale-like bracts. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikes. Sparganium flaccidum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
