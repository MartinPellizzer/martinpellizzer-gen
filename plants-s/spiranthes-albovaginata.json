    "intro": "Spiranthes albovaginata, commonly known as the white-veined ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraled arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and bogs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence."
