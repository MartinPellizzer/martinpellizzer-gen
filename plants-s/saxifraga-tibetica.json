    "intro": "Saxifraga tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saxifraga tibetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
