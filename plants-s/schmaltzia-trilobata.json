    "intro": "Schmaltzia trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often have three distinct lobes, contributing to its common name. Schmaltzia trilobata is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival."
