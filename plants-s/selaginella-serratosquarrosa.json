    "intro": "Selaginella serratosquarrosa, commonly known as the serrated squarrosa spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. Its morphology and habitat make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native ecosystems."
