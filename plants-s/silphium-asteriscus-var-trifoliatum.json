    "intro": "Silphium asteriscus var. trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf compass plant, is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is native to the central United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and leaves that are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive trifoliate appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by pale green ray florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides, and is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils. Due to its historical significance and ecological value, it is considered a valuable native plant for conservation and restoration efforts."
