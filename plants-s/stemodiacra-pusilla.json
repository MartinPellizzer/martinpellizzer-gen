It features a short, upright stem with small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
