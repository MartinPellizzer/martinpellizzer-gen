    "intro": "Sasaella shiobarensis f. mitinokuensis, commonly known as the Mitinokuensis form of the Shiobarensis sasaella, is a rare bamboo species native to Japan. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright culms and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. It has a clumping growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
