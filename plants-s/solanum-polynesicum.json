    "intro": "Solanum polynesicum, commonly known as the Pacific nightshade, is a shrub native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, violet flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish berries that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain birds. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
