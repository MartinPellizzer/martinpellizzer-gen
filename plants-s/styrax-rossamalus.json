    "intro": "Styrax rossamalus, commonly known as the Chinese frankincense tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Styracaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by glossy, elliptical leaves. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and the ability to produce a valuable aromatic gum. Styrax rossamalus is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and medicinal properties."
