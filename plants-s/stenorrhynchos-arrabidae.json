    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos arrabidae, commonly known as the Arrabida lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically bright green and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, with a distinctive elongated shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens across southern Europe."
