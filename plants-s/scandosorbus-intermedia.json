    "intro": "Scandosorbus intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange to red berries in the fall. Scandosorbus intermedia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of cold climate flora."
