    "intro": "Sorghum brachypodum, commonly known as little barley, is a small annual grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often mistaken for wheat or rye. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
