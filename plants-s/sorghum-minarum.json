    "intro": "Sorghum minarum, commonly known as the dwarf sorghum, is a lesser-known species within the grass family Poaceae. It is a small, annual plant that typically grows to a height of no more than 1 meter, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often green or purplish in color, and it is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Sorghum minarum is native to parts of Africa and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature and potential for use in local agriculture. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and agricultural studies."
