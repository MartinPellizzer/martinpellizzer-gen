    "intro": "Shorea myrionerva, commonly known as the black mangrove or *Rhizophora racemosa*, is a tropical tree belonging to the Dipterocarpaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its dark, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove forests, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse ecosystems. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. The tree is also notable for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it an important species in coastal restoration efforts."
