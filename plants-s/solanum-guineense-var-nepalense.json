    "intro": "Solanum guineense var. nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal nightshade, is a shrub native to regions of Asia, including Nepal and northern India. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and ovate, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that range in color from green to red as they mature. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its potential toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
