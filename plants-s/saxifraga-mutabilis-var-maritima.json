    "intro": "Saxifraga mutabilis var. maritima, commonly known as the sea saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils, making it an important component of maritime ecosystems."
