    "intro": "Salix glauca subsp. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its subspecific name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian areas. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
