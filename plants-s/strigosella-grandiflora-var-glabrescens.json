    "intro": "Strigosella grandiflora var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf strigosella, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
