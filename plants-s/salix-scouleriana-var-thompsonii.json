    "intro": "Salix scouleriana var. thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and riparian zones. The plant features slender, flexible stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are catkin-like, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing streambanks."
