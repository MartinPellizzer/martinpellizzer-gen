    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 novacastelensis, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a compact cyme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural wild environment."
