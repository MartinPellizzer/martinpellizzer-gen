    "intro": "Styrax angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a hard, resinous wood that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
