    "intro": "Scirpus mollis, commonly known as soft bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is a tall, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical clusters of small, white flowers in the summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystems. Scirpus mollis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
