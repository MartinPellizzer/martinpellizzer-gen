    "intro": "Schizachyrium engleri, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and open woodland habitats. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery in the fall, and its slender, spike-like inflorescence that produces small, feathery flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and well adapted to sandy or loamy soils, making it a valuable component of native plant landscapes. Schizachyrium engleri plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects and wildlife. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ornamental appeal."
