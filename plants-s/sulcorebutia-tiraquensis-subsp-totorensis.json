    "intro": "Sulcorebutia tiraquensis subsp. totorensis, commonly known as the Totorensis Candelabra Cactus, is a species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact, columnar shape and is often adorned with clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
