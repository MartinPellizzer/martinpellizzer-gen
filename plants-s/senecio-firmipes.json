It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to dry environments and suitable for rock gardens."
