    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's sunburst, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble a sunburst, hence its common name. The plant has a short, woody stem with broad, leathery leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sciodaphyllum pittieri is considered a rare and endangered species."
