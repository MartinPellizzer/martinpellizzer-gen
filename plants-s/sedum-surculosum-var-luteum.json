    "intro": "Sedum surculosum var. luteum, commonly known as the Orange Stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically orange to yellow in color, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for gardeners looking to add vibrant color with minimal care."
