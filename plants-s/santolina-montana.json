    "intro": "Santolina montana, commonly known as Spanish santolina, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is hardy and drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and its compact size makes it ideal for borders or containers. Santolina montana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in herbal remedies."
