    "intro": "Sarcostemma lineare, commonly known as the linear milkweed, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features slender, woody stems that twine around supporting structures, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release numerous tiny seeds. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is typical of the Asclepiadaceae family. Sarcostemma lineare thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or disturbed habitats."
