    "intro": "Sclerochloa multiculmis subsp. distans, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and savanna habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
