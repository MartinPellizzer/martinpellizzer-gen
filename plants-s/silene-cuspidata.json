It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its common name, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats. Silene cuspidata is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms. It is typically found in open areas such as meadows and along streambanks."
