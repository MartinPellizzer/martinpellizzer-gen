It is native to the Hawaiian Islands, particularly the island of Kauai, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often consumed by native birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its bark is smooth and reddish in color. Syzygium masukuense is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and introduced pests."
