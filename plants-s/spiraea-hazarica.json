    "intro": "Spiraea hazarica, commonly known as the Hazara spirea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and features dense, upright branches covered in small, oval leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage turns vibrant yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. Spiraea hazarica is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient choice for alpine or woodland gardens."
