    "intro": "Selliguea lanceola, commonly known as the lanceolate liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, with leaves that are elongated and lance-shaped, giving it its common name. Selliguea lanceola lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having a structure called a thallus. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
