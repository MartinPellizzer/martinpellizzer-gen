    "intro": "Scurrula robertsonii, commonly known as the Robertson's scurrula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scurrula robertsonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
