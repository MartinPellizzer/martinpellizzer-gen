    "intro": "Sporobolus robustus var. agrostideus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and restoration projects. Its ecological value includes providing habitat and forage for native wildlife."
