    "intro": "Sphaerium giganteum, commonly known as the giant globe shell, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its large, spherical, calcified fruit that resembles a shell. The plant is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical structure includes a fleshy, spiny pericarp that encases the seeds, which are dispersed by water currents. The plant's morphology is adapted for aquatic life, with roots that anchor it to substrates and a buoyant fruit for seed dispersal. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
