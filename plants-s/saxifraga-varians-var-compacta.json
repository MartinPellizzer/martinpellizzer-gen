    "intro": "Saxifraga varians var. compacta, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to horticultural collections."
