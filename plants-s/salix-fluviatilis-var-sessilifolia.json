    "intro": "Salix fluviatilis var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf willow, is a variant of the river willow characterized by its distinctive sessile leaves that are directly attached to the stems without stalks. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to wetlands and riverbanks in Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its elongated, narrow leaves are dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it produces catkins in early spring. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
