    "intro": "Salvia betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble the foliage of birch trees, hence its common name. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes. Salvia betulifolia is also valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
