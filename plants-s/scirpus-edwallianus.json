    "intro": "Scirpus edwallianus, commonly known as the Edwall's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Scirpus edwallianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
