    "intro": "Syzygium glaucum, commonly known as the white syzygium, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season, followed by edible, round fruits resembling small apples. Syzygium glaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a shade tree. Its fruit is used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
