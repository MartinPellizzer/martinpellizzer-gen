    "intro": "Salix caprea var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as riverbanks and woodland edges. The plant features slender, zigzagging stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its catkins are an important source of pollen for early-season pollinators. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
