    "intro": "Schoenus flaviculmis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, often playing a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Schoenus flaviculmis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in aquatic habitats."
