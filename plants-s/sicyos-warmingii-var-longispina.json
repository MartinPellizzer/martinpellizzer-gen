    "intro": "Sicyos warmingii var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined gourd, is a variant of the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae) native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, spiny tendrils and oval, pale green fruits that mature to a yellowish hue. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, with lobed leaves that are hairy on the underside. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a common trait in the Cucurbitaceae family. The fruit is edible when mature and is often used in traditional cuisine and herbal medicine."
