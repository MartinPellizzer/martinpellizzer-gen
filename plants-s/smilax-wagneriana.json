It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often armed with spines, and its compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spicate inflorescences, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Smilax wagneriana is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
