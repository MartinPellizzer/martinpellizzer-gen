    "intro": "Salisburia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, with spores released into the water column. The species is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and ecological significance in aquatic ecosystems."
