It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring strap-like, grassy leaves and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
