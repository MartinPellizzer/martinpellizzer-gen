    "intro": "Scirpus juncoides, commonly known as the tussock sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland habitats across North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves and dense, tussock-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually green or brownish in color. Scirpus juncoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
