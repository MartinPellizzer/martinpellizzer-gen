    "intro": "Sphenogyne pinnata, commonly known as the broadleaf sphenogyne, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are arranged in a feather-like pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies. Sphenogyne pinnata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
