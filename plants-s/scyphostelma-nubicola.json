    "intro": "Scyphostelma nubicola, commonly known as the cloudland star-of-Bethlehem, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Scyphostelma nubicola is considered a conservation concern."
