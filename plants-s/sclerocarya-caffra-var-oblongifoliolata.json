    "intro": "Sclerocarya caffra var. oblongifoliolata, commonly known as the African hazelnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically oblong and have small, closely spaced leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of hard, woody fruits containing edible seeds. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance, while the leaves turn yellow in autumn. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
