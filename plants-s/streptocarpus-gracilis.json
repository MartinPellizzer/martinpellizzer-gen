    "intro": "Streptocarpus gracilis, commonly known as the slender streptocarpus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, providing a textured appearance. This species thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its delicate blooms, often in shades of purple or pink, make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
