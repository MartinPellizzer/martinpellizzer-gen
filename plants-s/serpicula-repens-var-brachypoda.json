    "intro": "Serpicula repens var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed serpicula, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
