    "intro": "Sagittaria heterophylla f. rigida, commonly known as rigid arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive rigid texture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense spikes, which bloom above the water surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to help stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
