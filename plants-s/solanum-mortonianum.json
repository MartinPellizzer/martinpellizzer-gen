    "intro": "Solanum mortonianum, commonly known as the Mortonian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and tobacco. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it has a woody stem that becomes more branched as it matures. The fruit is a small, green berry that turns red when ripe, containing several seeds."
