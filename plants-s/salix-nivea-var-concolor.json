    "intro": "Salix nivea var. concolor, commonly known as the white willow with white bark, is a variant of the white willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark and slender, weeping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that reflects light, enhancing its ornamental value. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. It is valued for its aesthetic appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
