It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and pinnate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers followed by elongated, cylindrical pods that contain edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its high protein content and used in traditional cuisines. Additionally, it plays a role in soil improvement due to its nitrogen-fixing ability."
