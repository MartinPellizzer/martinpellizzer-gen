    "intro": "Stachytarpheta angustifolia var. brittoniae, commonly known as Britton's narrowleaf sage, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Stachytarpheta angustifolia."
