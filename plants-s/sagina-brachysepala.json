    "intro": "Sagina brachysepala, commonly known as the narrow-fruit snowflake, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling snowflakes, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Sagina brachysepala thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
