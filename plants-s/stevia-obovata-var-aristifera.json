    "intro": "Stevia obovata var. aristifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped, slightly pointed leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, making it a natural sweetener. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates."
