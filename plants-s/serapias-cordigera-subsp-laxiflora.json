It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals. Native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal, this subspecies thrives in rocky, arid environments. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
