    "intro": "Saussurea andryaloides, commonly known as the Tibetan safflower or Himalayan safflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Saussurea andryaloides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
