    "intro": "Sphalmanthus baylissii, commonly known as the Bayliss's spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a characteristic feature of the spurge family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
