    "intro": "Sonerila arnottiana var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly sonerila, is a shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
