    "intro": "Sorbus apiculata, commonly known as the mountain ash or rowan, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate, and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Sorbus apiculata is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native environment."
