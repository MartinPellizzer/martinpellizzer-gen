It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, hard, spiny fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Senegalia eriocarpa is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is sometimes used for forage or traditional purposes."
