    "intro": "Salix limosa var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. It has a flexible, branching structure and can grow up to 3\u20136 meters in height. The leaves turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal appearance in riparian habitats."
