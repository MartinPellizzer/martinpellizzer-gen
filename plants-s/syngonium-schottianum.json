It features heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Syngonium schottianum prefers well-draining soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
