    "intro": "Sium limosum, commonly known as water parsnip, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that grow on tall, hollow stems. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. Sium limosum thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and ponds."
