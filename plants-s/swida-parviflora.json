    "intro": "Swida parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered swida, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features slender, woody stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, red or orange berries in the autumn. Swida parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact form and seasonal color changes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden conditions."
