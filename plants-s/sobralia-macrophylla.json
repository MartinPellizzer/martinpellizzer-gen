    "intro": "Sobralia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant sobralia, is a striking tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in length, bearing numerous fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
