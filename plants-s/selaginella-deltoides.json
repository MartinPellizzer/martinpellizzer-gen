    "intro": "Selaginella deltoides, commonly known as the delta spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around its stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are dispersed by wind. Selaginella deltoides is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in ecological succession in forest ecosystems."
