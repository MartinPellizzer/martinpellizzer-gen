    "intro": "Selaginella anisoclada, commonly known as the variable spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is native to arid regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-bearing plants. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Selaginella anisoclada is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
