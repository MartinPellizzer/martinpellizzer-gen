    "intro": "Struthanthus tenuis, commonly known as the slender struthanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It has slender, branched stems and produces yellow or white flowers that are often clustered together. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
