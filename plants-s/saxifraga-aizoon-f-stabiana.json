    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon f. stabiana, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in crevices or on rock faces. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
