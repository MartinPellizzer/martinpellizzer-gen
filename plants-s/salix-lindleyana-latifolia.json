    "intro": "Salix lindleyana latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and long, narrow leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The broadleaf willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
