    "intro": "Salix triandra f. semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming weeping willow, is a cultivar of the weeping willow species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its graceful, cascading branches that hang in long, slender streams, creating a striking visual effect. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted near water features or in areas with high humidity. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade and habitat for wildlife."
