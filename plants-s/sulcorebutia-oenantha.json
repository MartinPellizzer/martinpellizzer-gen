    "intro": "Sulcorebutia oenantha, commonly known as the Desert Rose, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and fleshy, ribbed stems that store water for survival in dry conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, Sulcorebutia oenantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
