    "intro": "Sisymbrium curvipes, commonly known as the bent-leaf mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard species, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Sisymbrium curvipes is often considered a weed but has some historical use in traditional medicine."
