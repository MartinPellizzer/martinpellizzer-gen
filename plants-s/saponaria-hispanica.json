    "intro": "Saponaria hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fuzzy, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic when crushed, due to the presence of saponins. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its historical use in soap-making and as a medicinal herb highlights its botanical and practical significance."
