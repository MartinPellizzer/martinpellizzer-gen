It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, waxy texture. These flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. Stapelia quinquenervis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
