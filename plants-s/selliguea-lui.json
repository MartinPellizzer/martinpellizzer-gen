    "intro": "Selliguea lui, commonly known as the Chinese moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually green or reddish in color, and they lack true roots, stems, and flowers. Selliguea lui plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
