    "intro": "Schizocodon ilicifolius var. australis, commonly known as the Australian holly-leafed shrub, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that have a waxy, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
