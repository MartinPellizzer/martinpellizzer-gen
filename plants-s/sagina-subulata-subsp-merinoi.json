    "intro": "Sagina subulata subsp. merinoi, commonly known as the Merino's sandspurry, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round, greenish fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
