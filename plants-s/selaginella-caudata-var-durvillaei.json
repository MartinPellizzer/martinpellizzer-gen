    "intro": "Selaginella caudata var. durvillaei, commonly known as the African clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. This variant is noted for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
