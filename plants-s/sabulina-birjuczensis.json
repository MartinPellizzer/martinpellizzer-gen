    "intro": "Sabulina birjuczensis, commonly known as the Armenian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
