    "intro": "Stipa zalesskyi, commonly known as the Zalessky's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence and fine, wiry leaves that are adapted to arid and high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and steppe habitats. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Stipa zalesskyi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range."
