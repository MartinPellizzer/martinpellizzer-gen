    "intro": "Salix psilostachya, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wetlands. Salix psilostachya plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
