    "intro": "Scirpus triqueter f. pallidus, commonly known as the pale threesquare bulrush, is a variant of the threesquare bulrush, characterized by its pale green, slender stems and reduced leaf blade. It is a wetland plant native to North America, typically found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in three rows along the stem, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, three-angled seeds. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
