    "intro": "Saccostoma urticifolium, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its stinging hairs on its leaves, which contain irritants similar to those found in true nettles. The plant has palmate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its roots and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous to handle without proper protection."
