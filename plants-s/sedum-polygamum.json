    "intro": "Sedum polygamum, commonly known as the silver rose or desert sedum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it store water, and it produces clusters of star-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Sedum polygamum is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular plant in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
