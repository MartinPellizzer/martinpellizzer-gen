    "intro": "Spiraea crenifolia f. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf spiraea, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in clusters during the spring, typically from April to May. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glabrous (hairless) surface, distinguishing it from the typical variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
