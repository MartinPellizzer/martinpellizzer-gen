    "intro": "Sida modesta, commonly known as smallleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are small capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. Sida modesta is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
