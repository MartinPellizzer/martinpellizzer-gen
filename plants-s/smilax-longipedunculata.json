It features woody stems with sharp, recurved spines and is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikelike inflorescences. Its fruit is a red, fleshy berry that ripens in the fall and is an important food source for wildlife. Smilax longipedunculata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks."
