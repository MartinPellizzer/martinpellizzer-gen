    "intro": "Sorbaria alpina, commonly known as alpine sorbaria, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Sorbaria alpina is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in garden settings."
