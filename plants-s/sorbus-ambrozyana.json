    "intro": "Sorbus ambrozyana, commonly known as the Ambrozyan whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and finely toothed leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Sorbus ambrozyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native environment."
