    "intro": "Stipa roerichii, commonly known as the Roerich's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray leaves and fluffy, feathery seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in panicles. Stipa roerichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
