    "intro": "Symphyotrichum bahamense, commonly known as the Bahamian aster, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, adapting well to salty air and wind exposure. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with the stems often appearing woody at the base. Symphyotrichum bahamense plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to tropical environments."
