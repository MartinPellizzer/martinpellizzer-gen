    "intro": "Staurochilus guibertii, commonly known as the Guibert's star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique star-shaped flowers, which are typically violet or purple in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its delicate, strap-like leaves are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in cool, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Staurochilus guibertii is considered a conservation concern."
