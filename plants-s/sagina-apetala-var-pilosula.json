    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. pilosula, commonly known as hairy sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they bloom in early spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable ground cover in dryland gardens."
