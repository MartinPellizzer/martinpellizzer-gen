It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and leaves with a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
