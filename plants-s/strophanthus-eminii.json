    "intro": "Strophanthus eminii, commonly known as the giant African rue, is a striking climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faintly toxic scent. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically compound, with long, slender leaflets, and the plant can grow quite vigorously in suitable conditions. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
