    "intro": "Smilax polycolea, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats. Botanically, it belongs to the genus Smilax in the family Araceae, and it is known for its adaptability to various soil types and light conditions."
