It is characterized by its creeping, branching stems that produce small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporophylls that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of vascular plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Selaginella seemannii plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
