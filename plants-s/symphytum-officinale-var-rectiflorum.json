    "intro": "Symphytum officinale var. rectiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved comfrey, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and tall spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It contains allantoin, a compound with healing properties, making it useful in traditional herbal medicine. However, due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and not ingested."
