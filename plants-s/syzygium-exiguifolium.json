    "intro": "Syzygium exiguifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, sour fruits similar to tamarind. Syzygium exiguifolium thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
