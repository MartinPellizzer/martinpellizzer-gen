    "intro": "Stapelia pulchella, commonly known as the \"beautiful corpse\" or \"stapeliopsis,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months. Stapelia pulchella is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
