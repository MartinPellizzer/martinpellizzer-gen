    "intro": "Statice nebrodensis, commonly known as the Sicilian statice, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Statice nebrodensis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience to coastal conditions."
