    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis var. pilosella, commonly known as the hairy loosestrife, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. This variant is valued in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
