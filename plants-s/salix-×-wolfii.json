    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 wolfii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is a natural hybrid between Salix cinerea and Salix viminalis, characterized by its slender, flexible stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as stream banks and marshes, and is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth. Its flowers are catkins, which appear in early spring, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
