    "intro": "Sagittaria arifolia var. cuneata, commonly known as narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are narrow and tapering, typically floating on the water surface or submerged in shallow waters. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters above the water, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil, making it useful for wetland restoration projects."
