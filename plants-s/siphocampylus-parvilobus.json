    "intro": "Siphocampylus parvilobus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Siphocampylus parvilobus is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
