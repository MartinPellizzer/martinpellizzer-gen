    "intro": "Senecio murrayanus, commonly known as Murray's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months."
