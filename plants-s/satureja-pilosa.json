    "intro": "Satureja pilosa, commonly known as woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage with a fuzzy texture due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Satureja pilosa is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, with a strong, minty aroma."
