    "intro": "Stenocactus dichroacanthus, commonly known as the two-colored hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a spineless cactus characterized by its cylindrical stem and distinctive two-toned coloration, typically green with a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
