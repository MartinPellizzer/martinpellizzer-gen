    "intro": "Stipa zalesskyi var. maeotica, commonly known as the Crimean feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of the Caucasus and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces feathery inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements due to their delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and ornamental gardens. This variety is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
