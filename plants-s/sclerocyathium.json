    "intro": "Sclerocyathium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its hard, woody stems and striking, spiny leaves that often resemble those of holly. The flowers are typically blue or purple and are borne in dense, spike-like clusters. These plants are native to southern Africa and are adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Sclerocyathium species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
