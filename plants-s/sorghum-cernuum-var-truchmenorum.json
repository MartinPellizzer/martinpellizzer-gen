It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, dry seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
