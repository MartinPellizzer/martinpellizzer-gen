    "intro": "Scabiosa frivaldskyi, commonly known as the Frivaldsky's globemallow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, bright pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Scabiosa frivaldskyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by gardeners interested in drought-tolerant plants."
