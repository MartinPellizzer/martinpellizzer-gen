    "intro": "Saldanhaea convoluta, commonly known as the twisted sandalwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often twisted or rolled, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Saldanhaea convoluta is valued for its hard, fragrant wood, which has been used traditionally for crafting and as a source of incense."
