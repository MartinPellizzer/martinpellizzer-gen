    "intro": "Salix hastata var. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, exhibiting a compact, multi-stemmed form. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
