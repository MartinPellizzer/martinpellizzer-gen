It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and has slender, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a common weed in cultivated areas."
