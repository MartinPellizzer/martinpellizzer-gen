    "intro": "Salix repens var. flavicans, commonly known as the yellow willow, is a variant of the creeping willow native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in moist, often wet environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, flexible stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a yellowish-green hue that distinguishes it from other willow varieties. The flowers are catkin-like, producing small, inconspicuous blooms that contribute to its ecological role in riparian zones."
