    "intro": "Silene velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit catchfly, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous regions. Silene velebitica is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
