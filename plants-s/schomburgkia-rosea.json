    "intro": "Schomburgkia rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered cycad, is a rare and striking member of the Cycadaceae family. Native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, it is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces large, showy cones, with the female cones displaying a striking pinkish hue. Schomburgkia rosea is a slow-growing plant that thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
