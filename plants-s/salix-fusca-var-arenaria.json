    "intro": "Salix fusca var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible branches and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in catkins. The plant has finely toothed leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along riverbanks and in desert margins. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
