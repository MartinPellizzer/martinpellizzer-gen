It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy, grayish-white foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a distinctive silvery-white underside. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
