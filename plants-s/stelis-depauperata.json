    "intro": "Stelis depauperata, commonly known as the poor orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant prefers a warm, humid environment and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. It has fibrous roots and is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of orchids."
