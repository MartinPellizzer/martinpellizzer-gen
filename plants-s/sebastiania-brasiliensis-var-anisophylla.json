    "intro": "Sebastiania brasiliensis var. anisophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. The plant has alternate, simple, and often elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and the fruit develops from these flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
