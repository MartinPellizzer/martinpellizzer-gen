    "intro": "Stelis lopezii, commonly known as the Lopez's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring a blend of white, green, and purple hues. Stelis lopezii thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for specialized horticulture. Its botanical significance lies in its role within the diverse orchid flora of the Neotropics."
