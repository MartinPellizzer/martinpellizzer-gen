It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, erect stem that bears a few leaves and a single, showy flower. The plant typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species.
