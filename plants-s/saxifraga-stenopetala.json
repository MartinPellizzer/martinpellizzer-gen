    "intro": "Saxifraga stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clustered rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
