    "intro": "Schizachyrium microstachyum, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and dry woodland habitats. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and distinctive, slender, spike-like inflorescence that turns reddish-brown in maturity. The plant is drought-tolerant and plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife in grassland ecosystems. It blooms in late summer, producing small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Schizachyrium microstachyum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in native plant gardens."
