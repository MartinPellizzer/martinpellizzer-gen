    "intro": "Stadtmannia depressa, commonly known as the depressed Stadtmannia, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has small, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical features include a short, thick stem and hairy foliage, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Stadtmannia depressa is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its ecosystem."
