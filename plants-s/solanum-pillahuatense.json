    "intro": "Solanum pillahuatense, commonly known as the Pillahuata nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in parts of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments within the understory of forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Solanum genus."
