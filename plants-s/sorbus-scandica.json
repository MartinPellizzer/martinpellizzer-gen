    "intro": "Sorbus scandica, commonly known as the climbing whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into three to five oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland or hedgerow environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
