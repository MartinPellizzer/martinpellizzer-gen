    "intro": "Selaginella sanguinolenta var. compressa, commonly known as the red-stemmed spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and reddish stems, which give it its common name. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized spores and adaptive structures. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and arranged in whorls around the stem. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions, where it thrives in low-nutrient environments."
