    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 multidentata, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to China and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often used in ornamental landscaping. The tree has slender, pale green leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for riparian zones and garden settings. This species is valued for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
