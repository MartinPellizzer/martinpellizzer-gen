    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth elderberry, is a variant of the elderberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically oval with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds and should be prepared carefully. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and woodland edges."
