    "intro": "Solanum polyacanthos var. oreophilum, commonly known as the mountain nightshade, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive violet to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which contribute to its ability to thrive in cooler, more humid environments. Its fruit is a small, toxic berry that contains alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique ecological adaptations and ornamental value."
