    "intro": "Spiranthes goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis Ladies' Tresses, is a rare orchid species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraled inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, elongated seed pods after blooming. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
