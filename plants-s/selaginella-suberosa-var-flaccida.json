    "intro": "Selaginella suberosa var. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid spikemoss, is a species of moss plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and creeping growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte produces spores in capsules that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. This variant is distinguished by its somewhat flaccid or limp appearance compared to other varieties of Selaginella."
