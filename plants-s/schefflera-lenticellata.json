    "intro": "Schefflera lenticellata, commonly known as the variegated schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with white or cream-colored veins and margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera lenticellata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
