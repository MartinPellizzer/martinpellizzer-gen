    "intro": "Sesleria calcaria, commonly known as the limestone grass, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Sesleria calcaria is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens and borders."
