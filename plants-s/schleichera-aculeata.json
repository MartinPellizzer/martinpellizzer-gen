It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Schleichera aculeata thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
