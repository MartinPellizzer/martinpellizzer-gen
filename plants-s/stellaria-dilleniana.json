    "intro": "Stellaria dilleniana, commonly known as the starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in star-like clusters, which give it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and damp meadows. Stellaria dilleniana is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
