    "intro": "Salvinia nymphellula, commonly known as floating moss, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, floating mats of finely divided, feather-like leaves that allow it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its reproductive structures are borne on specialized, spore-bearing leaves called sporocarps. It is native to regions in Africa and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies, it can become invasive in non-native habitats."
