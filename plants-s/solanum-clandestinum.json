    "intro": "Solanum clandestinum, commonly known as the common nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are initially green and turn red when mature. These berries contain toxic compounds such as solanine and scopoline, making them harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, the plant has been used in traditional medicine and has ecological significance as a food source for certain wildlife."
