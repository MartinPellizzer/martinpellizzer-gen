    "intro": "Sagina magellanica, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to South America. It features small, prostrate stems that spread across the ground, often forming dense, green carpets. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in groups of three. Its leaves are ovate to round, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Sagina magellanica is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams."
