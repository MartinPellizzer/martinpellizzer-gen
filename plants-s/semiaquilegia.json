These plants are typically found in moist, woodland habitats and are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette and often have a distinctive waxy coating. Semiaquilegia species are known for their ability to thrive in wet environments, making them important components of riparian ecosystems. They produce small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
