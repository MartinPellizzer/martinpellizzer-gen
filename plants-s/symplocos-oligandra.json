    "intro": "Symplocos oligandra, commonly known as the small-fruited wax tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Symplocos oligandra thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitats."
