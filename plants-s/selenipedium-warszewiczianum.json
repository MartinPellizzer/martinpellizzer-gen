    "intro": "Selenipedium warszewiczianum, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, thin stems and large, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is classified as endangered in many regions."
