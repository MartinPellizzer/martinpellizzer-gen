    "intro": "Scirpus helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in dense clumps. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences composed of small, three-lobed flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marshy environments. Scirpus helferi is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
