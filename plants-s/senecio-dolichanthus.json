    "intro": "Senecio dolichanthus, commonly known as the long-flowered senecio, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is a perennial herb native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features slender, branching stems and produces showy yellow to orange flower heads composed of numerous small florets. Its leaves are typically linear to lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it often grows in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
