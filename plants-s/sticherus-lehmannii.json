    "intro": "Sticherus lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's sticherus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
