    "intro": "Spodiopogon petiolaris, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments in eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Spodiopogon petiolaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
