    "intro": "Synthyris ritteriana var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved synthyris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct basal rosette structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
