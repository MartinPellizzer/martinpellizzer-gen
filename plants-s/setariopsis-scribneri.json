    "intro": "Setariopsis scribneri, commonly known as the Scribner's beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
