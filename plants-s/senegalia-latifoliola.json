    "intro": "Senegalia latifoliola, commonly known as the screwbean tree, is a drought-tolerant shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a spreading crown with thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a fibrous, spongy coating. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its adaptability makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
