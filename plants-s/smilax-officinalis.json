    "intro": "Smilax officinalis, commonly known as yellow wood or cat's foot, is a perennial climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in sharp, spine-like tubercles. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and wildlife. Smilax officinalis is a member of the family Aristolochiaceae and is known for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional remedies. Its rhizomes and berries have been utilized in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
