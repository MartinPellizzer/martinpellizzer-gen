    "intro": "Swida stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters, featuring slender, upright branches and small, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces white or pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils. Swida stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
