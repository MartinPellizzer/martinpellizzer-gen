    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ulothii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Salix \u00d7 ulothii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
