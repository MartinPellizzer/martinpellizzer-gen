    "intro": "Sporobolus virgatus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Sporobolus virgatus is often found in open habitats such as prairies, dunes, and disturbed areas."
