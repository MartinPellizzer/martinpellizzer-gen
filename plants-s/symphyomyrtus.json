    "intro": "Symphyomyrtus, commonly known as the silky oak, is a genus of flowering plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. These trees are native to Australia and are characterized by their broad, silvery-green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Symphyomyrtus grandiflora and Symphyomyrtus australis, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance. The flowers are typically white or pink and are borne in clusters, attracting pollinators like birds and insects. The wood of Symphyomyrtus is hard and durable, making it useful for construction and furniture-making."
