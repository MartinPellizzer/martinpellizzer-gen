    "intro": "Serpocaulon latipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved serpocaulon, is a small, terrestrial orchid found in specific habitats across Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and a single, erect stem bearing a few narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spiral at the tip of the stem, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
