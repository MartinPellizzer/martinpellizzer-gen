It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
