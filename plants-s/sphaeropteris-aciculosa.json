    "intro": "Sphaeropteris aciculosa, commonly known as the needle fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, delicate fronds that resemble pine needles. The plant has a distinctive crown of arching, linear leaves that give it a unique, elegant appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located at the base of the fronds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
