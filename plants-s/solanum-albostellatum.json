    "intro": "Solanum albostellatum, commonly known as the white-stemmed nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
