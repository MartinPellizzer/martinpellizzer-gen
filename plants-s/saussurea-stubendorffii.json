    "intro": "Saussurea stubendorffii, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saussurea stubendorffii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
