It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. It has hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Scholtzia calcicola is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
