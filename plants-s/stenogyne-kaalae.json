    "intro": "Stenogyne kaalae, commonly known as the Kalaheo or Hawaiian stenogyne, is a flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant grows in coastal and lowland habitats, often in sandy or rocky soils. It is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is considered rare due to habitat loss and invasive species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and endemic species."
