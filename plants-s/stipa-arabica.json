    "intro": "Stipa arabica, commonly known as the Arabian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, awned florets. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Stipa arabica plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
