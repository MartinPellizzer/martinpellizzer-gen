    "intro": "Senecio lechleri, commonly known as the lupine tree or maca tree, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, woody stem and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its latex contains a high concentration of alkaloids, making it both medicinally significant and potentially toxic. It is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, including its use in traditional Andean medicine."
