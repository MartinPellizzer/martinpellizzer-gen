It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in tight inflorescences. Sedum paui thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
