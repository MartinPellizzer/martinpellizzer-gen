    "intro": "Schefflera rufa, commonly known as the red-veined Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound, palmately arranged leaves that often have distinctive red veins, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Schefflera rufa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal. It is relatively low-maintenance and can adapt to a variety of indoor growing conditions."
