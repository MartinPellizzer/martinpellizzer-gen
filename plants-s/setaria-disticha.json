    "intro": "Setaria disticha, commonly known as bearded grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, bristly inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often found in disturbed soils or open areas. Setaria disticha is a hardy plant that is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a cover crop."
