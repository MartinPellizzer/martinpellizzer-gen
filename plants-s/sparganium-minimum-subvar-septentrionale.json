It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, spiky, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats and providing food for aquatic and avian wildlife."
