    "intro": "Sphaeroma dregeanum, commonly known as the Cape dune lily, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive dry periods. Sphaeroma dregeanum is often found in coastal dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing the sand and supporting local biodiversity."
