    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 semiphylicifolia, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction and contribute to its ecological role in riparian zones. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, rivers, or wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
