    "intro": "Stapelia wendlandiana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor, mimicking the scent of decaying meat to attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it blooms during the warmer months. Stapelia wendlandiana is a popular choice for succulent collectors due to its unusual appearance and low maintenance requirements."
