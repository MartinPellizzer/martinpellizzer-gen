    "intro": "Soldanella montana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features slender stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers, usually in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers compared to other forms of Soldanella montana."
