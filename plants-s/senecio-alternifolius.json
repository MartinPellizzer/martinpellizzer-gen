    "intro": "Senecio alternifolius, commonly known as the zigzag groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and alternate leaves that are usually narrow and linear. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
