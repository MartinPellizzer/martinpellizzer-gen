It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of spikelets along its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or alpine environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with the leaves often appearing bluish-green due to a waxy coating. The inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets, which are arranged in a compact, panicle-like structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens and natural landscapes."
