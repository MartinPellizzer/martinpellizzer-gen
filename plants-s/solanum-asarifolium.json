    "intro": "Solanum asarifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb with hairy stems and small, green leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
