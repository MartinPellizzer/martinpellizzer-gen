    "intro": "Silene rosulata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
