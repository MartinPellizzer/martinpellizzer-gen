    "intro": "Salvia altimitrata, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sage, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy violet to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Salvia altimitrata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
