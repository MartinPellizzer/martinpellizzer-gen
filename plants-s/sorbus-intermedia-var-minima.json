    "intro": "Sorbus intermedia var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf whitebeam, is a small shrub or tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
