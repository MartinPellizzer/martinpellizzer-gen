    "intro": "Sorghum fuscum, commonly known as black sorghum, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to black stems and leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its drought tolerance, it is also used in some agricultural systems as a forage crop."
