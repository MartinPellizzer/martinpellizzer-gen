It is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, often with a hairy texture. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, with five petals, and it produces small, dark berries that contain toxic compounds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed and is not cultivated for food or ornamental purposes."
