    "intro": "Sorghum vulgare var. nervosum, commonly known as the nervy sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum species native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive nervy or vein-like patterns on the leaves, which give it its common name. This plant is typically an annual grass that thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its grain. The leaves are narrow and tapering, with a prominent midrib that enhances its ornamental appeal. It is also valued for its resilience to drought and its potential use in both culinary and industrial applications."
