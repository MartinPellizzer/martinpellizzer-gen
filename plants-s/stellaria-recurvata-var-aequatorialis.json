    "intro": "Stellaria recurvata var. aequatorialis, commonly known as the Andean starwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy as well. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
