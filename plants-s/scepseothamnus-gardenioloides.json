    "intro": "Scepseothamnus gardenioloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Scepseothamnus gardenioloides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
