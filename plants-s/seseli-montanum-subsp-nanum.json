    "intro": "Seseli montanum subsp. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf mountain seseli, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has a compact growth form, with stems that are usually less than 30 cm in height, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
