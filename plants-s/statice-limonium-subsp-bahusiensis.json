    "intro": "Statice limonium subsp. bahusiensis, commonly known as the Bahusian sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces spikes of blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal areas and dune environments. Its narrow, linear leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and drought tolerance."
