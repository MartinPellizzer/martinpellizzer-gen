    "intro": "Selaginella rzedowskii, commonly known as the Rzedowski's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae) and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores necessary for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges."
