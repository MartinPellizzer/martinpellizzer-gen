    "intro": "Stipa cerariorum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are small and dispersed by wind. Stipa cerariorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
