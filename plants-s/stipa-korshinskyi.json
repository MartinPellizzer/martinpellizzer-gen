    "intro": "Stipa korshinskyi, commonly known as the Korshinsky's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to golden in color. The plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. Its fibrous root system helps it retain moisture and stabilize the soil in its native habitat. Stipa korshinskyi plays a role in preventing soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
