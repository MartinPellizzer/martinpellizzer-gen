It features succulent, ovate leaves with striking variegation of white, green, and sometimes pink, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
