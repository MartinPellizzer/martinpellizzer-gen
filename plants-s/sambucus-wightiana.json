    "intro": "Sambucus wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's elderberry, is a species of shrub native to the Andes mountains in South America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed with caution due to their potential toxicity. Sambucus wightiana typically grows in moist, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 6 meters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
