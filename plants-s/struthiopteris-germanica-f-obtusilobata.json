    "intro": "Struthiopteris germanica f. obtusilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed field shieldfern, is a fern species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with broad, rounded lobes that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
