    "intro": "Spilanthes ramosa, commonly known as the hairy pincushion plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branched, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Spilanthes ramosa is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
