    "intro": "Saxifraga porophylla var. sibthorpiana, commonly known as the Sibthorpian saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, often hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, alpine conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
