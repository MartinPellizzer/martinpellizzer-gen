It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it useful for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
