    "intro": "Sabia emarginata, commonly known as the margined sabia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Sabia emarginata is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
