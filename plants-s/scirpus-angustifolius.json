    "intro": "Scirpus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, cylindrical spikes of small, greenish flowers. This species thrives in moist to wet environments such as marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
