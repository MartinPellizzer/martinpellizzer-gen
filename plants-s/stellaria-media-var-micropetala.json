    "intro": "Stellaria media var. micropetala, commonly known as lesser starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and opposite in arrangement. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along paths, and in woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its smaller petals and shorter leaves compared to the typical Stellaria media."
