    "intro": "Schizopsis labiata, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple center. Schizopsis labiata is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and the ability to store water in its stems. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various desert animals."
