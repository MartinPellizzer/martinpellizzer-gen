    "intro": "Saxifraga moschata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, forming dense clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
