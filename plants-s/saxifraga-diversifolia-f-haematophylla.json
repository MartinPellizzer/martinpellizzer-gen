    "intro": "Saxifraga diversifolia f. haematophylla, commonly known as the bloodleaf saxifrage, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically green with striking red or purple veins, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a rare garden specimen."
