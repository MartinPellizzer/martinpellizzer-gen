    "intro": "Salix dimorphophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf willow, is a species of willow native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, often swampy areas. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are divided into two pairs of lobes, giving it its common name. Its catkins are yellowish and appear in early spring, followed by small, inconspicuous flowers. The bark is smooth and grey, and the plant is adapted to wetland environments, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
