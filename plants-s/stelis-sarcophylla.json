    "intro": "Stelis sarcophylla, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich substrates it inhabits. Stelis sarcophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
