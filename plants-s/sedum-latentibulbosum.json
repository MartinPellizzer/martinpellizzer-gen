    "intro": "Sedum latentibulbosum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically blooming in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, Sedum latentibulbosum is an ideal plant for sustainable landscaping."
