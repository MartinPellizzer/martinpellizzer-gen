    "intro": "Spiranthes brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved ladies' tresses, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a perennial herb that produces a dense, spiral arrangement of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, instead having reduced leaf-like structures. Spiranthes brevifolia is often found in North America and is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
