    "intro": "Schizoloma trichomanoides, commonly known as the slender wallrue, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or wooded slopes. Schizoloma trichomanoides is a relatively rare species, with a limited geographic distribution primarily in tropical and subtropical regions."
