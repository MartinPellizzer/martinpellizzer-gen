    "intro": "Schoenoplectus mucronatus var. tataranus, commonly known as the Tatarian bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Eurasia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, lake margins, and riverbanks. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers at the top. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight hairiness on the underside. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic life."
