    "intro": "Septimetula, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. They typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Septimetula species are often used in traditional medicine and have a relatively long history of cultivation in certain regions."
