    "intro": "Stapelia \u00d7 massonii var. livida, commonly known as the \"Corpse Flower\" or \"Stapelia,\" is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and dark green, somewhat hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often yellow or orange with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, a feature that attracts pollinators like flies. It is a popular choice for collectors due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements. This variant is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water."
