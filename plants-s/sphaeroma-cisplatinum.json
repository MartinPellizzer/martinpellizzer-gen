    "intro": "Sphaeroma cisplatinum, commonly known as the platinum sphere shell, is a species of marine bivalve mollusk belonging to the family Sphaeromatidae. It is characterized by its small, rounded, and often iridescent shell, which can display a variety of colors depending on light conditions. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its common name, though it is not a plant but an invertebrate. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found in sandy or muddy substrates. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to both marine biologists and collectors."
