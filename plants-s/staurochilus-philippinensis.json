    "intro": "Staurochilus philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and clustered, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are often short-lived but highly attractive to pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
