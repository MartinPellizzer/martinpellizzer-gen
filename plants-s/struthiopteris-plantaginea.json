    "intro": "Struthiopteris plantaginea, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a continuous line along the underside of the fronds."
