    "intro": "Scirpus articulatus var. stramineus, commonly known as the yellow bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, reed-like stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically yellow or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
