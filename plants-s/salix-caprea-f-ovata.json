    "intro": "Salix caprea f. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf willow, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a naturally occurring form of Salix caprea, characterized by its ovate, lance-shaped leaves that are often more rounded than those of the typical species. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in temperate climates. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in early pollination cycles. The bark is smooth and grey, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
