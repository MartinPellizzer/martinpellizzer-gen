It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features succulent leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Schizonotus argenteus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance."
