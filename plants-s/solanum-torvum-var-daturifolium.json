    "intro": "Solanum torvum var. daturifolium, commonly known as the \"wild potato vine,\" is a vigorous, fast-growing vine native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive purple calyx. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that turn red when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids. It is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, and is considered an invasive species in some areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable example of the Solanaceae family's diverse morphology."
