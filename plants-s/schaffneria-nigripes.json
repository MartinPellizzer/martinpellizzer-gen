    "intro": "Schaffneria nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed schaffneria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its woody stems and clustered, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, opposite leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers, which range in color from white to purple, bloom in the spring and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schaffneria nigripes is considered a species of conservation concern."
