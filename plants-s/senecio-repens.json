    "intro": "Senecio repens, commonly known as creeping groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features wiry, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Senecio repens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
