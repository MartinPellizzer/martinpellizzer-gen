    "intro": "Stegastrum bahajense, commonly known as the Bahamian grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments. Stegastrum bahajense plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
