    "intro": "Sobralia tamboana, commonly known as the Tamboan Sobralia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without being parasitic. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a unique, spurred lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Sobralia tamboana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
