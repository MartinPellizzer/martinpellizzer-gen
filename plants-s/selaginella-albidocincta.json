    "intro": "Selaginella albidocincta, commonly known as the white-bordered spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resurrection plant. Its sporophyte produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Selaginella albidocincta plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
