    "intro": "Salix atrocinerea subf. pauliniana, commonly known as the black willow or blackleaf willow, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dark, often fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and its flowers are usually monoecious, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. It thrives in moist, often riparian habitats and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. The species is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
