    "intro": "Sartorina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in clusters. Sartorina is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it often thrives in warm, humid environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
