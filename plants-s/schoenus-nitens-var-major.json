    "intro": "Schoenus nitens var. major, commonly known as the giant flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its potential use in phytoremediation."
