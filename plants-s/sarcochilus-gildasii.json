    "intro": "Sarcochilus gildasii, commonly known as the Gildas's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, with a unique, almost ghostly appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
