    "intro": "Scutellaria scordiifolia var. polyphylla, commonly known as the many-leaved blueweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive blue-green hue. Its small, tubular flowers are typically blue or violet, arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. This variant is distinguished by its increased leaf number and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Scutellaria scordiifolia."
