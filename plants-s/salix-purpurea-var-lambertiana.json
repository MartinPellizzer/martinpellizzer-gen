It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
