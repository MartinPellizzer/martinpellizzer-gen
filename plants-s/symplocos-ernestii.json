    "intro": "Symplocos ernestii, commonly known as Ernest's wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes other well-known plants like blueberries and rhododendrons. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are pale green and clustered in small umbels, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Symplocos ernestii thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
