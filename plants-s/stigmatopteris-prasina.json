    "intro": "Stigmatopteris prasina, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, narrow pinnae arranged in a distinctive pattern. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
