It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and easy-to-care-for ornamental plant."
