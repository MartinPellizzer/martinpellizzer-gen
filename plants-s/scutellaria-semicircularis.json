It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Scutellaria semicircularis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
