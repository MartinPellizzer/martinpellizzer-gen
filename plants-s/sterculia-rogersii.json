    "intro": "Sterculia rogersii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces showy yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing angular seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often used in traditional medicine and construction. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
