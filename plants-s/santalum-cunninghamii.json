    "intro": "Santalum cunninghamii, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive aromatic scent. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by dark, woody fruits containing small, hard seeds."
