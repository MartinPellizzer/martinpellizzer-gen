    "intro": "Solanum fultum, commonly known as the golden nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring hairy stems and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. These flowers give way to berries that start green and mature to a striking orange-red color, containing the plant's toxic seeds. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
