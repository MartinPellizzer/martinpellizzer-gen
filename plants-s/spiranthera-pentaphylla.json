    "intro": "Spiranthera pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leafed spiranthes, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshy environments. Its leaves are usually five in number, hence the species name \"pentaphylla,\" and are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
