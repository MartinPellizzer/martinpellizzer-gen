    "intro": "Sabularia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal sand dunes. It is characterized by its small, linear leaves and a single, pale yellow flower that blooms in early summer. The plant is well adapted to harsh, salty environments and has a deep root system to access moisture. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and preventing erosion. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
