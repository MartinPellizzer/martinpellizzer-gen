    "intro": "Statice aggregata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Statice aggregata is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in floral arrangements and traditional medicine."
