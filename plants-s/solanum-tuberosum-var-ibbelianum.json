    "intro": "Solanum tuberosum var. ibbelianum, commonly known as the Ibelian potato, is a lesser-known variant of the common potato. It is characterized by its unique tuber morphology, which often includes a higher proportion of starch and a distinct flavor profile compared to typical potatoes. This variety is native to South America, specifically the Andean region, where it has been cultivated for generations. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves with a slightly serrated edge. Due to its rarity and specific growing conditions, it is less commonly found in commercial agriculture but holds significance in traditional farming practices."
