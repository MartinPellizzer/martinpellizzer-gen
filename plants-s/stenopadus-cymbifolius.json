    "intro": "Stenopadus cymbifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved stenopadus, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific microhabitats. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
