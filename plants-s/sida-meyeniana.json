    "intro": "Sida meyeniana, commonly known as Mexican mallow, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sida meyeniana is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other moist habitats."
