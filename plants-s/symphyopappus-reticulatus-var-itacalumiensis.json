    "intro": "Symphyopappus reticulatus var. itacalumiensis, commonly known as the Itacalumis goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in dense, showy clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a woody base with branching stems that often grow close to the ground, forming a low shrub. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
