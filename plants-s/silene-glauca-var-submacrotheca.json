    "intro": "Silene glauca var. submacrotheca, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the stems are often reddish in color. The variety submacrotheca is distinguished by its larger, more elongated floral bracts compared to the typical form of Silene glauca."
