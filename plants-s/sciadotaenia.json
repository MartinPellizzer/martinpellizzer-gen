    "intro": "Sciadotaenia, commonly known as the African rain forest fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of a fern, though it is not a true fern. The plant typically grows in the shaded, moist environments of tropical and subtropical forests. Sciadotaenia species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
