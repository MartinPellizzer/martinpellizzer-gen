    "intro": "Senecio leucanthemifolius var. nemoralis, commonly known as the woodland groundseller, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver-white underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
