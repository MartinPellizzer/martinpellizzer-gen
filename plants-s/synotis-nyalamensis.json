    "intro": "Synotis nyalamensis, commonly known as the Nyalam sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in open grasslands or forest edges. Its yellow-orange petals are prominent, and it produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Synotis nyalamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
