    "intro": "Selaginella melanesica, commonly known as the Melanesian spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, a feature typical of many spore-producing plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution and adaptation."
