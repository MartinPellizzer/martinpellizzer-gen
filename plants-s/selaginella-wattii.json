It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinct appearance with spirally arranged leaves and a short, branching stem. Selaginella wattii exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized cellular structures. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, produce spores that contribute to its propagation and ecological role in various habitats."
