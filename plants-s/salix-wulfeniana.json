    "intro": "Salix wulfeniana, commonly known as the Wulfen's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically glandular-dotted. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are usually male and female on separate plants. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a fragrant, resinous scent. Salix wulfeniana is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
