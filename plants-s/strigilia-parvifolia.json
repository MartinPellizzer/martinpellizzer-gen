    "intro": "Strigilia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved starflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and rise above the foliage, bearing several flowers along their length. Strigilia parvifolia is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
