    "intro": "Sempervivum montanum f. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain houseleek, is a succulent plant characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months."
