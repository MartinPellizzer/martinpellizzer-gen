    "intro": "Sedum scopulinum, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing succulent that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late summer. Its fleshy leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain water in arid environments. Sedum scopulinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
