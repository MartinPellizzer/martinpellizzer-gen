    "intro": "Salvia dolomitica, commonly known as the Dolomite sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and spikes of violet to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Salvia dolomitica is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for bees and other pollinators."
