    "intro": "Strychnos schultesiana, commonly known as the Schultes's strychnos, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody, serpentine fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy aril. It is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, similar to those found in other members of the genus Strychnos. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies."
