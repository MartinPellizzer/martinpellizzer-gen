    "intro": "Salmea fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in dry soils. Salmea fruticulosa is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
