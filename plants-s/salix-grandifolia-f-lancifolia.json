    "intro": "Salix grandifolia f. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination and seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
