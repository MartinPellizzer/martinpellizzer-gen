    "intro": "Salvia marchandii, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with gray-green, fuzzy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking violet-blue flower spikes in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources."
