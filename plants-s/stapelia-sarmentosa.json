    "intro": "Stapelia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, trailing stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are small, thick, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Stapelia sarmentosa is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a hanging plant."
