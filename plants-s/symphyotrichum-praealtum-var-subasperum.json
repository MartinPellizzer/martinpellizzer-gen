    "intro": "Symphyotrichum praealtum var. subasperum, commonly known as the rough blue mistflower, is a North American flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, blue to purple composite flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, which gives the variety its name \"subasperum.\" It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
