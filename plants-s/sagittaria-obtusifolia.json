    "intro": "Sagittaria obtusifolia, commonly known as broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense colonies that help stabilize shorelines. The plant has arrow-shaped leaves that float on the surface or emerge from the water, with narrow, grass-like leaves submerged beneath. Its small white flowers appear in spikes above the water, and it produces berries that are dispersed by water. Sagittaria obtusifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
