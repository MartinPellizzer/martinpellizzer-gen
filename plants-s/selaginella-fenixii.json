    "intro": "Selaginella fenixii, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is renowned for its remarkable ability to survive extreme desiccation. This fern-like plant can lose up to 95% of its water content and enter a dormant state, only to revive when exposed to moisture. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid regions, such as Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. Its leaves are narrow and spirally arranged, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant's unique survival mechanisms make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticulture."
