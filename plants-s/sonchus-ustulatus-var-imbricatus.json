    "intro": "Sonchus ustulatus var. imbricatus, commonly known as the roughleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, hairy leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in a composite head, which are surrounded by bracts that are often glandular and hairy. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
