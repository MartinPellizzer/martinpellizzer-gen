    "intro": "Spergula laricina, commonly known as slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and damp woodlands. Spergula laricina is characterized by its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
