    "intro": "Spiraea decumbens subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy spiraea, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features slender, arching stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
