    "intro": "Schizoloma divergens var. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate schizoloma, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
