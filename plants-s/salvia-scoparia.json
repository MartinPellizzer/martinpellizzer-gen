    "intro": "Salvia scoparia, commonly known as narrowleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Salvia scoparia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
