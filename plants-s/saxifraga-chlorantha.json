    "intro": "Saxifraga chlorantha, commonly known as the green saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra environments. Saxifraga chlorantha is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to protect itself from harsh weather conditions."
