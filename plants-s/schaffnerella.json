    "intro": "Schaffnerella, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. Schaffnerella species are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
