    "intro": "Savastana fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's savastana, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine layer of soft hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Savastana fraseri is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
