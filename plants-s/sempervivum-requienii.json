It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum requienii is also known for its resilience and ability to survive in harsh climates."
