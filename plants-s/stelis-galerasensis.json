It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clustered, showy flowers. The plant typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
