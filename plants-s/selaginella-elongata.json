    "intro": "Selaginella elongata, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. It produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, which are released into the air for reproduction. Selaginella elongata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its resilience to environmental stress."
