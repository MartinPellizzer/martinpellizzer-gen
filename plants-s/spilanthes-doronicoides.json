    "intro": "Spilanthes doronicoides, commonly known as the Mexican toothache plant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is known for its strong, pungent odor. Its scientific name, Spilanthes, refers to the \"spike-like\" arrangement of its flowers, while doronicoides suggests a resemblance to the genus Doronicum. The plant has been traditionally used in folk medicine for its potential medicinal properties, including its ability to relieve toothache and other inflammatory conditions."
