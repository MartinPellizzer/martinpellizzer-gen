    "intro": "Saxifraga planipetala, commonly known as the flat-leaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga planipetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
