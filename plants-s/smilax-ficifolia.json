    "intro": "Smilax ficifolia, commonly known as the fig-leaf greenbriar, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It features a climbing habit with thorny stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that resemble fig leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its root system is extensive and can be used in traditional medicine. Smilax ficifolia is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial shade."
