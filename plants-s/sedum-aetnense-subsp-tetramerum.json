    "intro": "Sedum aetnense subsp. tetramerum, commonly known as the Etna sedum, is a succulent plant native to the volcanic regions of Italy. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
