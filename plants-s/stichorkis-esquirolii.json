    "intro": "Stichorkis esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's stichorkis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it prefers shaded, moist environments. It is often found growing in rocky crevices or on limestone substrates, which contribute to its unique ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
