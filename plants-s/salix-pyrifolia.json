    "intro": "Salix pyrifolia, commonly known as the paperbark willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in papery layers, giving it its common name. The plant produces catkins as its primary floral structure, which are typical of willow species. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a serrated margin. Salix pyrifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
