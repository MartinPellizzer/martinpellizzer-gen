    "intro": "Saussurea cauloptera, commonly known as the mountain safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and yellowish-orange composite flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Saussurea cauloptera thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters."
