    "intro": "Salix reticulata var. sericea, commonly known as silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-gray bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, silky down. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
