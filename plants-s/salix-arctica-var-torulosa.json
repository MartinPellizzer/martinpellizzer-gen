    "intro": "Salix arctica var. torulosa, commonly known as the Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, willow-like leaves and catkins, which are adapted to the harsh, cold climate. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in unstable ground and survive extreme weather conditions. Salix arctica var. torulosa plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various arctic wildlife species."
