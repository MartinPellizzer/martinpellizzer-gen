    "intro": "Swida paucinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with prominent, parallel veins that give it its scientific name. Swida paucinervis is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
