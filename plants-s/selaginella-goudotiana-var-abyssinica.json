    "intro": "Selaginella goudotiana var. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure with small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems. This variant is native to Ethiopia and is adapted to rocky, arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance through its ability to survive desiccation. Its spores are produced in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the plant's branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
