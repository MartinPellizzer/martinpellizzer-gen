    "intro": "Syzygium corticosum, commonly known as the rough-skin tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to reveal edible seeds, which are often used in traditional culinary applications. Syzygium corticosum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
