    "intro": "Saxifraga lactea, commonly known as the milky saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Saxifraga lactea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife in its native range."
