    "intro": "Sedum xerophilum, commonly known as the desert sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky soils or in crevices, where it can receive minimal moisture. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
