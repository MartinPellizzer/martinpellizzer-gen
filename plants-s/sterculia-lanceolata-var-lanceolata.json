    "intro": "Sterculia lanceolata var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sterculia, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a sticky resin. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
