    "intro": "Salix vallesia, commonly known as Vallesian willow, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it typically blooms in the spring. Salix vallesia thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous or riverine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of willow flora in the Andes."
