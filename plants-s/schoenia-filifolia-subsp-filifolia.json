    "intro": "Schoenia filifolia subsp. filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
