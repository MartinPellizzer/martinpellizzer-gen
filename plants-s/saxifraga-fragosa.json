    "intro": "Saxifraga fragosa, commonly known as the rockfoam, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Saxifraga fragosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
