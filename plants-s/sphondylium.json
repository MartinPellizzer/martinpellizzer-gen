    "intro": "Sphondylium, commonly known as the common cocklebur, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that encase the seeds, which are often used as a food source for birds and small mammals. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in heads. Sphondylium species are often considered weeds but play a role in supporting local ecosystems."
