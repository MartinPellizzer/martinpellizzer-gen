It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive leaf venation pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a bell-shaped structure typical of the genus. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
