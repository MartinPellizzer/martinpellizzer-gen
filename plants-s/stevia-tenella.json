    "intro": "Stevia tenella, commonly known as sweetleaf or sugarleaf, is a perennial shrub native to Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are highly aromatic. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Stevia tenella is cultivated for its leaves, which contain steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used as alternatives to sugar. Its drought tolerance and adaptability make it a valuable plant in both traditional medicine and modern herbal applications."
