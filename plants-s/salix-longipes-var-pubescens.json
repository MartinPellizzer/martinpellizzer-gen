    "intro": "Salix longipes var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky white hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typically yellow-green in color and appear in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
