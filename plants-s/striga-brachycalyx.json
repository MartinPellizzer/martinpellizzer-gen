    "intro": "Striga brachycalyx, commonly known as the short-calyx witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and has a complex life cycle that involves germination triggered by chemical signals from its host. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants, making it a serious agricultural pest."
