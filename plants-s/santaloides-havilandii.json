    "intro": "Santaloides havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's sandalwood, is a rare and unique plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that relies on other plants for some of its nutrients, while still performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system forms a symbiotic relationship with fungi, which helps it absorb water and minerals from the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
