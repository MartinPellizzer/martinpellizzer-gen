    "intro": "Salvia robusta f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple giant sage, is a striking perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 6 feet in height, adorned with large, showy violet to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are hairy and emit a strong minty scent when crushed. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its long blooming period from summer to fall attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
