    "intro": "Syzygium endophloium, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly sought after in the furniture and carving industries. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a warm, humid climate with well-drained soil. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, while its flowers are small and white, often arranged in clusters. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, Syzygium endophloium is now critically endangered and protected under international conservation laws."
