    "intro": "Stipa tenuis var. argentina, commonly known as the Argentine needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense tussocks. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a slight bluish-gray hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
