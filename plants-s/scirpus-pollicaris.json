    "intro": "Scirpus pollicaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers, which are typically found at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help it spread through vegetative propagation. Scirpus pollicaris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
