    "intro": "Solidago terrae-novae, commonly known as the Newfoundland goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Solidago terrae-novae plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal dunes."
