    "intro": "Selatium, commonly known as the bluebell or bluebell flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Selatium species are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, often growing in woodland or grassland habitats. They typically have slender stems and compound leaves, with flowers arranged in umbels. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they can be invasive in certain areas."
