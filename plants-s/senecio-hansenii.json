It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
