    "intro": "Senecio tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Senecio tibeticus is often found in alpine meadows and is a component of the unique flora of the Himalayan region."
