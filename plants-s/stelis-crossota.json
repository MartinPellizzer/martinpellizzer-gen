    "intro": "Stelis crossota, commonly known as the Crossotta orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces strikingly colorful, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with intricate patterns. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis crossota is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and adaptability to various growing conditions."
