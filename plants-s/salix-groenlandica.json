    "intro": "Salix groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
