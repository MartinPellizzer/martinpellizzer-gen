    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris f. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian spikemoss, is a rare and specialized fern ally native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of protective cuticle, aiding in water retention. It reproduces through spores, typical of its order, and is often found in crevices or on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native region."
