    "intro": "Solanum incanum var. pluribaccatum, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features glandular-hairy stems and leaves, with small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
