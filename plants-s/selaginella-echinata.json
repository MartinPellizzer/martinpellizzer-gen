    "intro": "Selaginella echinata, commonly known as the spike moss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Selaginella echinata is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its desiccation-tolerant spores. Its reproductive structures, including strobila, are essential for its life cycle and ecological role in nutrient cycling."
