It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a waxy cuticle, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, typically in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
