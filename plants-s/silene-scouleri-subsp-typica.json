    "intro": "Silene scouleri subsp. typica, commonly known as the Pacific silverweed, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid or maritime environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. Silene scouleri subsp. typica plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
