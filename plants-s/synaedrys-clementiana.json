    "intro": "Synaedrys clementiana, commonly known as the Clementian cypress, is a rare and unique species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, scale-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female structures. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
