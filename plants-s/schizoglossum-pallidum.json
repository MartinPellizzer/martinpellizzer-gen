    "intro": "Schizoglossum pallidum, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers and its unique growth habit, often growing on the bark of trees in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a short, tubular stem and produces small, clustered flowers with three petals and three sepals. Its botanical significance lies in its rarity and its role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Schizoglossum pallidum is a federally endangered species, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
