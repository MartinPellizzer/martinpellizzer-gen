    "intro": "Steffensia caracasana, commonly known as the Caracasana steffensia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
