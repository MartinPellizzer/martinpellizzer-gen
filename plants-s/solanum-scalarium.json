    "intro": "Solanum scalarium, commonly known as the mountain nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are often toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in high-altitude, temperate climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings but is of interest in botanical research."
