    "intro": "Saxifraga aquatica var. secunda, commonly known as the water saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its rosette growth form and features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to aquatic conditions and is often found in ponds, streams, and wet meadows. Due to its aquatic adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
