It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. It is often found growing in dense clusters, forming a carpet-like ground cover in its natural habitat."
