This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its catkins are a notable feature, with male and female flowers appearing on separate stems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting wildlife and stabilizing riverbanks."
