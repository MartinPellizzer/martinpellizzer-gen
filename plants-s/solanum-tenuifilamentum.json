    "intro": "Solanum tenuifilamentum, commonly known as the slender threadleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
