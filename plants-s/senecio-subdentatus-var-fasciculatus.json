It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has alternate, oblanceolate leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive white underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
