    "intro": "Solanum rostellatum, commonly known as the desert tomatillo, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These fruits are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in traditional cuisines. Solanum rostellatum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
