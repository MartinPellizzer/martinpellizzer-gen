    "intro": "Salix sclerophylla pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, and it produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize riverbanks."
