    "intro": "Salix phylicifolia f. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, elongated leaves that are often bluish-green in color, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This form is a naturally occurring variant of the broader Salix phylicifolia species."
