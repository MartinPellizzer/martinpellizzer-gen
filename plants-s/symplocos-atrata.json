    "intro": "Symplocos atrata, commonly known as black-berried evergreen. It is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Symplocos atrata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
