    "intro": "Salix lasiogyne, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a species of willow native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Salix lasiogyne is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
