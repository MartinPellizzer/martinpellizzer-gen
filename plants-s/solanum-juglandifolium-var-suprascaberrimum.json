    "intro": "Solanum juglandifolium var. suprascaberrimum, commonly known as the rough-leaved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in stiff, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into round, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes many economically important crops and toxic species. Due to its hairy foliage and potential toxicity, it is often found in rocky or arid habitats where it can thrive with minimal water."
