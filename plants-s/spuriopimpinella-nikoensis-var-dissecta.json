    "intro": "Spuriopimpinella nikoensis var. dissecta, commonly known as the Niko dissected bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant features finely dissected, pinnate leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers, typically white or pale blue, bloom in early summer and are surrounded by a cluster of bracts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
