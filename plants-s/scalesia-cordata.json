    "intro": "Scalesia cordata, commonly known as the shield vine, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to 10 meters in length, characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant has a unique adaptation to the island's environment, with its thick, fleshy stems and leaves helping it conserve moisture. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Scalesia cordata plays an important ecological role in the Gal\u00e1pagos, providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
