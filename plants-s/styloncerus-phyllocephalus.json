    "intro": "Styloncerus phyllocephalus, commonly known as the leaf-headed antlion, is a species of predatory insect found in various regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Myrmeleontidae, which includes antlions and their relatives. The plant association of this species is not direct, as it is an insect rather than a plant; however, it is often found in habitats with specific vegetation. Its name suggests a possible morphological resemblance to plant structures, though this is not a botanical feature. The insect's ecological role is more related to its predatory behavior rather than any botanical characteristics."
