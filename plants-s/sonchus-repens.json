    "intro": "Sonchus repens, commonly known as common mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant has alternate, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and covered in fine white pubescence. Its small, yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by oval, spiny seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along roadsides."
