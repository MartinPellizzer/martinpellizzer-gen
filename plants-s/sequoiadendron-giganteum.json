    "intro": "Sequoiadendron giganteum, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a towering coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its massive size, with some specimens reaching heights of over 300 feet and diameters exceeding 15 feet. The tree has reddish-brown bark that is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and insect damage. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Giant sequoias are long-lived, with some individuals estimated to be over 3,000 years old, making them one of the oldest living organisms on Earth."
