    "intro": "Stipa debilis, commonly known as slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and slender, often arching stems that produce feathery plumes during the flowering season. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Stipa debilis is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
