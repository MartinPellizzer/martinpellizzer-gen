    "intro": "Syringa komarowii subsp. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed mock orange, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a dense, compact growth habit. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and pleasant fragrance, though it is less commonly cultivated than other syringa species."
