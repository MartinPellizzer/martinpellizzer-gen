    "intro": "Stryphnodendron polyphyllum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
