It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flower heads that are often used in traditional medicine. Its roots are valued for their aromatic properties and are used in Ayurvedic remedies. Saussurea indica thrives in high-altitude regions and is adapted to cold, arid environments."
