    "intro": "Selaginella martensii var. flaccida, commonly known as the limp spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, spiky shoots that bear microphylls, which are small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophylls are arranged in clusters and produce spores in specialized structures called sporangia. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate periods of drought, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
