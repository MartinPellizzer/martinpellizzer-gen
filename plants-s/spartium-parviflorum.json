    "intro": "Spartium parviflorum, commonly known as smallflower sicklevetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Spartium parviflorum is valued for its role in soil fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
