    "intro": "Sabal causiarum, commonly known as the cabbage palmetto, is a hardy palm native to the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its fan-shaped leaves and a stout, unbranched trunk that often develops a swollen base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, showing resistance to salt and flooding. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it a significant component of wetland ecosystems."
