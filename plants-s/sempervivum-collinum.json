    "intro": "Sempervivum collinum, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a hardy succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and can survive in poor soil conditions. It produces small, pink or red flowers in the summer, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. Sempervivum collinum is often used in rock gardens and alpine arrangements due to its ornamental value and resilience."
