    "intro": "Symphytum donii, commonly known as the Crimean comfrey, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and tall spikes of violet or blue flowers. The plant belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is known for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used traditionally in herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
