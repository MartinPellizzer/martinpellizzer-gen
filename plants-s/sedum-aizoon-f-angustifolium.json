    "intro": "Sedum aizoon f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It is native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. Its leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water efficiently. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
