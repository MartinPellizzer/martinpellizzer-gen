    "intro": "Sedum boryanum, commonly known as the Arctic sedum, is a perennial flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species adapted to extreme climates. Sedum boryanum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in cold climates due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
