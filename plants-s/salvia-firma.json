    "intro": "Salvia firma, commonly known as the rigid sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces spikes of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
