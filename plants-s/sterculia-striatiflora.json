    "intro": "Sterculia striatiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sterculia, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
