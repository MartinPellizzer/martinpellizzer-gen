    "intro": "Sideroxylon lanuginosum subsp. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, woolly coating on the stems and leaves, which provides protection against drought and herbivory. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun."
