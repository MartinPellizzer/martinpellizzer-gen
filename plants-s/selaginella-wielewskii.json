    "intro": "Selaginella wielewskii, commonly known as the Lepidophyta, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation. This plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are embedded within the leaf-like structures called sporophylls. Selaginella wielewskii is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and resilience."
