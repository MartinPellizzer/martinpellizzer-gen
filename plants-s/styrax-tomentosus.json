    "intro": "Styrax tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and young leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in panicles. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Styrax tomentosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
