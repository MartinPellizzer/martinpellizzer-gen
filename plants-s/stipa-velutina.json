    "intro": "Stipa velutina, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Stipa velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
