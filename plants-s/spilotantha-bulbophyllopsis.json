    "intro": "Spilotantha bulbophyllopsis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, bulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which open at night. Its flowering period is brief and occurs only under specific environmental conditions, making it a subject of interest for botanists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spilotantha bulbophyllopsis is considered endangered and is the focus of conservation efforts."
