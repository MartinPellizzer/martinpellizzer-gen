It features dense clusters of blue-green leaves that are fleshy and adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its low maintenance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
