    "intro": "Sarcochilus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive helmet-shaped pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces few, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a unique, elongated lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species."
