    "intro": "Sambucus melanocarpa var. communis, commonly known as black elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its clusters of small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The berries are used in culinary and medicinal applications, though the plant contains toxic compounds in its raw form."
