    "intro": "Stelis nexipous, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a short, slender stem with a few leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
