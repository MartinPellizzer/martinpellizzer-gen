    "intro": "Sambucus intermedia, commonly known as common elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate with 5 to 9 leaflets, and its clusters of small, white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds. Sambucus intermedia is often found in moist woodlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of berries for culinary purposes."
