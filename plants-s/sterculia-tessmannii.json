    "intro": "Sterculia tessmannii, commonly known as the Koa tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. The tree produces woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
