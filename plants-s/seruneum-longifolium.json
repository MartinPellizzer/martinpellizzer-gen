    "intro": "Seruneum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved seruneum, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Seruneum longifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
