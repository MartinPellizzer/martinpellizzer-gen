It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, arranged in clusters, and are adapted for wind pollination. Scaphochlamys concinna plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small insects and arthropods."
