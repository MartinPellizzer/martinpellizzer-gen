It is characterized by its delicate, herbaceous stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant morphology and adaptation."
