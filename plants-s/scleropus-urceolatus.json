    "intro": "Scleropus urceolatus, commonly known as the shield fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often densely covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Scleropus urceolatus is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
