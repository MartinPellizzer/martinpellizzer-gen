    "intro": "Silene armeria f. minor, commonly known as the lesser sea pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, sandy habitats. It is often found in dunes and rocky shores, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh maritime environments."
