    "intro": "Scilla fehrii, commonly known as the Fehri's squill, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbs are relatively small and store nutrients to support its growth cycle. Scilla fehrii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates."
