It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its delicate nature, it is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
