    "intro": "Sunipia arunachalense, commonly known as the Arunachal Himalayan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Arunachal Pradesh, India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its strikingly beautiful, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky and forested areas, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and leathery, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native region."
