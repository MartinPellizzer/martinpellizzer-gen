    "intro": "Spigelia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved spigelia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other related species. The plant is characterized by its showy, reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. Spigelia sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained soils."
