    "intro": "Siemssenia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly small and clustered at the base of the plant. Siemssenia microcephala is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
