    "intro": "Selaginella gracilis, commonly known as the slender spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are often narrow and grass-like in appearance. Selaginella gracilis reproduces via spores, which are produced in specialized structures called strobila, located at the tips of its stems. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
