    "intro": "Salix exigua var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a variant of the narrowleaf willow species native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks and wetlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. Its flowers are catkin-like, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a characteristic common in willow species. The leaves and twigs are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a habitat and food source for various wildlife."
