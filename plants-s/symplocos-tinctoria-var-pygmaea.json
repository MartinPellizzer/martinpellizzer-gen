    "intro": "Symplocos tinctoria var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Indian inkberry, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its berries, which are dark blue to black in color, are edible but have a tart flavor. This variety is a smaller form of the species, with compact growth and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
