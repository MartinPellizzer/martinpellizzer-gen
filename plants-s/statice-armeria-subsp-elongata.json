    "intro": "Statice armeria subsp. elongata, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental use in coastal gardens and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
