    "intro": "Salix vagans bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored weeping willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and striking two-toned leaves that range from bright yellow to green. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in riparian zones."
