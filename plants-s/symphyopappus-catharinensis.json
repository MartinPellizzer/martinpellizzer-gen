It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its woody stem and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind.
