    "intro": "Sphaeropteris trichodesma, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
