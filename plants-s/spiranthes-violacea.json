    "intro": "Spiranthes violacea, commonly known as the violet lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, spiraled arrangement of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
