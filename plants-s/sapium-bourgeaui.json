    "intro": "Sapium bourgeaui, commonly known as Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It features alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules that split open to release seeds. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
