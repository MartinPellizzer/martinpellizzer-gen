    "intro": "Smythea lanceata, commonly known as the lanceleaf smythea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, gourds, and squash. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers that are typically followed by small, edible fruits. Smythea lanceata is often cultivated for both ornamental purposes and its edible fruits, which have a mild, sweet flavor. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
