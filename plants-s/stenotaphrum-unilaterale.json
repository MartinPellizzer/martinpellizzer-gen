    "intro": "Stenotaphrum unilaterale, commonly known as the narrowleaf st. Augustinegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a rhizomatous growth habit that allows it to form a thick turf. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a slightly folded appearance, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and landscapes. Its ability to recover quickly from damage makes it a resilient grass species for warm climates."
