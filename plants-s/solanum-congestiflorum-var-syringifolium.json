    "intro": "Solanum congestiflorum var. syringifolium, commonly known as the clustered-flower nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are woody and often branched. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
