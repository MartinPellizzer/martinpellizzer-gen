    "intro": "Saxifraga tridactylites f. flaccidissima, commonly known as the flaccid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variant is distinguished by its notably floppy, drooping leaves compared to the more upright form of the species."
