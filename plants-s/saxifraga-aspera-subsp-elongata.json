It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features upright stems that can reach up to 30 cm in height, adorned with oval, toothed leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
