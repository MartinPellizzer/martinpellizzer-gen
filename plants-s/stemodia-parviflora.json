    "intro": "Stemodia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered stemodia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to dry conditions. Its stem is often woody and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
