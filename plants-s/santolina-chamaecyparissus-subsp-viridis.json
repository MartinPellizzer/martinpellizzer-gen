    "intro": "Santolina chamaecyparissus subsp. viridis, commonly known as green santolina, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, silver-green foliage with a strong aromatic scent, often described as reminiscent of citrus or pine. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
