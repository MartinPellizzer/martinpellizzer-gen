    "intro": "Saxifraga hookeri var. glabrisepala, commonly known as the glabrous-sepal saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, with petals that are often reflexed. The leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. This variety is characterized by its smooth, hairless sepals, which distinguish it from other saxifrage species. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions."
