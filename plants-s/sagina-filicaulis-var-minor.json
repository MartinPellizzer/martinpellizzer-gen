    "intro": "Sagina filicaulis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tiny, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ground cover."
