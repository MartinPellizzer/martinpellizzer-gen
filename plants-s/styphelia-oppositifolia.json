    "intro": "Styphelia oppositifolia, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in heathlands and sand dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its dense, dark green foliage. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, arranged in opposite pairs along the stems, which is reflected in its scientific name. Styphelia oppositifolia is well adapted to the harsh coastal environment, with features that help it withstand salt spray and strong winds."
