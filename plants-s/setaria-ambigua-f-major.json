    "intro": "Setaria ambigua f. major, commonly known as the broadleaf foxtail, is a grass species native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with bracts that are longer than the flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
