    "intro": "Sempervivum hausmannii, commonly known as the Hausmann's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Sempervivum hausmannii is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
