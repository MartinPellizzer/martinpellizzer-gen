    "intro": "Stellaria dichotoma lusus glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular starwort, is a flowering plant characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine, glandular hairs that give the plant its distinctive name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
