    "intro": "Santaloides papuana, commonly known as the Papuan sandalwood, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Santalaceae family and exhibits a unique growth habit, with a woody stem and a dense root system that attaches to the roots of other plants. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its root system to absorb nutrients from host trees. Its small, white flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, Santaloides papuana is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
