    "intro": "Spenceria, commonly known as the dwarf African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. Spenceria species typically thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and containers. They produce small, fluffy seed heads that add visual interest to the plant throughout the growing season. Due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, Spenceria plants are popular choices for xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style gardens."
