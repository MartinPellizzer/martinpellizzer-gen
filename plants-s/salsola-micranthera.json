    "intro": "Salsola micranthera, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant native to Eurasia and North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prickly, spiny stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. It produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive nature in some regions. Salsola micranthera is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid climates."
