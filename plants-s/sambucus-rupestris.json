    "intro": "Sambucus rupestris, commonly known as the rock elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 6 feet. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a slightly serrated edge. Sambucus rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
