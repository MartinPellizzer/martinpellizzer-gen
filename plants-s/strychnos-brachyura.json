    "intro": "Strychnos brachyura, commonly known as the narrow-leafed strychnos, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Like other members of its genus, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
