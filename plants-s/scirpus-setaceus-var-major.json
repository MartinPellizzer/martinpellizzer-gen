    "intro": "Scirpus setaceus var. major, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant features tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, covered with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering spikes, which appear at the top of the stems, produce small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms."
