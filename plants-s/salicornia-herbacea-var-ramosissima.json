    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea var. ramosissima, commonly known as sea beans or glassworts, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other moist, saline habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
