    "intro": "Solidago pallida, commonly known as pale goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Pale goldenrod is an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
