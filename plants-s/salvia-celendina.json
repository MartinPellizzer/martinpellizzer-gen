    "intro": "Salvia celendina, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, slightly hairy, and have a fragrant, mint-like scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
