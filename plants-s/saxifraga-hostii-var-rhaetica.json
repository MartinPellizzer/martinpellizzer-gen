    "intro": "Saxifraga hostii var. rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the Alps. It features rosettes of dark green, woolly leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
