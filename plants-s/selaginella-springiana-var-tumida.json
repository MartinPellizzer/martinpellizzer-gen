    "intro": "Selaginella springiana var. tumida, commonly known as the cushion spikemoss, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of closely packed, scale-like leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This species is notable for its ability to survive extreme drought conditions, making it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems."
