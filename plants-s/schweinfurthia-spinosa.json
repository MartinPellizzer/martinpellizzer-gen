    "intro": "Schweinfurthia spinosa, commonly known as the snowbell or mountain snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Schweinfurthia spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators in its native habitat."
