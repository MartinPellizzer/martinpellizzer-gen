    "intro": "Stromatocactus, commonly known as the \"cork cactus,\" is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their thick, segmented stems that are often covered in a waxy, cork-like layer, which helps reduce water loss. Stromatocactus species typically have spiny or bristly structures for protection against herbivores. They thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in their fleshy stems. The flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in the evening and are pollinated by moths and bats."
