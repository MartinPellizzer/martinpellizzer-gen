    "intro": "Sabicea marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy sabicea, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Marojejy National Park in northern Madagascar. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique morphology, including compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in the humid, montane rainforest environment, where it is adapted to the region's specific climatic conditions. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this endemic and ecologically significant plant."
