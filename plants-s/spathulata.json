    "intro": "Spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, flat leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Spathulata species typically grow in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Their unique floral structure and ornamental value make them popular in horticulture."
