    "intro": "Saxifraga caveana var. caveana, commonly known as the cave saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to subterranean environments such as caves and limestone habitats. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its specialized habitat, it is often found in association with other cave-adapted flora."
