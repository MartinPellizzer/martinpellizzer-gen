    "intro": "Selaginella nivea subsp. humbertii, commonly known as the white spikerush, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of linear, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporophylls, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ability to survive in challenging climates make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
