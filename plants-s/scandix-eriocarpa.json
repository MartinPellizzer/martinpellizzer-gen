    "intro": "Scandix eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly ballhead, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its fruit is a dry, spherical capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Scandix eriocarpa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
