    "intro": "Saprosma subrepanda, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
