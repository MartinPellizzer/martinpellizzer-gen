    "intro": "Schizoloma griffithianum, commonly known as the Griffith's schizoloma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded forest undergrowth. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or white in color. Schizoloma griffithianum is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, which includes a distinct midrib and a slightly serrated margin. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
