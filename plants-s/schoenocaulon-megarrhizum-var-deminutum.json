    "intro": "Schoenocaulon megarrhizum var. deminutum, commonly known as the dwarf root-stemmed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the western United States. It features fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an attractive and easy-to-care-for ornamental plant."
