    "intro": "Siolmatra amazonica, commonly known as the golden rain orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the dense rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It thrives in the high humidity and dappled sunlight of the canopy layers, often growing on tree trunks and branches. The plant features striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction, Siolmatra amazonica is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
