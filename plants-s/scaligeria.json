It comprises several species, most of which are native to regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. These plants typically have upright, branching stems and are characterized by their small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale pink petals. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Scaligeria species are often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where they thrive in well-drained soils."
