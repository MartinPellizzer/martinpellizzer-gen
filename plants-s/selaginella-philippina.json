    "intro": "Selaginella philippina, commonly known as the Philippine spikemoss, is a small, terrestrial fern-like plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its elongated, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive extreme environmental conditions, including desiccation, due to its specialized water-storing cells. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and rock crevices. Selaginella philippina plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystem."
