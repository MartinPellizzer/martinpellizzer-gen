    "intro": "Spiranthes allemanii, commonly known as the Alleman's ladies' tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, spiraling inflorescence of pale yellow to white flowers, which resemble a twisted ribbon. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. It has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-brown seed pods after flowering. Spiranthes allemanii is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range."
