    "intro": "Siphonia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments, showcasing their halophytic nature. Siphonia species are characterized by their distinctive blue or violet flowers, which often have a tubular shape and are arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. These plants play an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
