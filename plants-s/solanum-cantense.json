    "intro": "Solanum cantense, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries, which are usually red when ripe. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly hairy texture. Solanum cantense belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains alkaloids, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
