    "intro": "Salvia officinalis var. latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaf sage, is a variant of the common sage plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its wider, more robust leaves compared to the standard Salvia officinalis. The plant produces showy violet or purple flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for herb gardens. This variety is valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in cooking, traditional medicine, and herbal remedies."
