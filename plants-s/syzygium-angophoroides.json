It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its large, broad, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It is often found in coastal and riparian habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these environments. Syzygium angophoroides is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used in construction and furniture-making."
