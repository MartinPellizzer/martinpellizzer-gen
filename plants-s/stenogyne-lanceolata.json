    "intro": "Stenogyne lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland habitats, often in moist, well-drained soils. It is part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms. Stenogyne lanceolata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
