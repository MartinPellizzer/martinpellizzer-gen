    "intro": "Sedum racemiferum, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It typically blooms in late summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. Sedum racemiferum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
