    "intro": "Staberoha imbricata, commonly known as the overlapping leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately divided, ovate leaves that are arranged in an overlapping pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, spore-bearing cones. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique leaf structure makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and a popular choice for indoor gardening."
