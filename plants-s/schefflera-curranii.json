    "intro": "Schefflera curranii, commonly known as the Curran's umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant indoors. Its adaptability to various light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
