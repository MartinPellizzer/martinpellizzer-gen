    "intro": "Stipa joannis f. asperior, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, tufted inflorescences that are often adorned with silky, silver-tipped bristles. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine, rough hairs, which give it its common name and contribute to its distinctive appearance. This grass is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, feathery look."
