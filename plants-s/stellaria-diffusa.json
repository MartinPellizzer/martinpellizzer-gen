    "intro": "Stellaria diffusa, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves that are often mistaken for mouse ears, and it typically grows in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, along paths, and in gardens. Stellaria diffusa is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
