    "intro": "Steiropteris decussata var. costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often arranged in a decussate pattern, meaning they cross each other in pairs. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting the growth of its large, compound leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
