    "intro": "Symphoricarpos \u00d7 doorenbosii, commonly known as the hybrid snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries in the fall, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a versatile addition to native gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and colorful fruits, which contribute to its ecological and aesthetic appeal."
