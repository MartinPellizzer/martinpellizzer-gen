    "intro": "Sieversia atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sieversia, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Sieversia atlantica plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for local wildlife."
