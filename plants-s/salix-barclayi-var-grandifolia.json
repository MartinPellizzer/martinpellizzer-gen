    "intro": "Salix barclayi var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, catkin-like inflorescences that are typically yellow-green in color, appearing in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a finely toothed margin. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
