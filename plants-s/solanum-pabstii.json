    "intro": "Solanum pabstii, commonly known as Pabst's nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the high Andes mountains of Peru and grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its berries are toxic and contain alkaloids, similar to other members of the Solanum genus. Due to its restricted habitat, Solanum pabstii is considered a rare and endangered species."
