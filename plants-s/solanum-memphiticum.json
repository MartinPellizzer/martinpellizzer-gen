    "intro": "Solanum memphiticum, commonly known as the Memphis nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is recognized for its ecological role in supporting certain wildlife species."
