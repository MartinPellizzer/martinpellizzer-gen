    "intro": "Scutellaria tayloriana, commonly known as Taylor's bluehead, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and canyon walls. Scutellaria tayloriana is a perennial herb that is relatively uncommon and of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure."
