It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and prefers moist, nutrient-rich soils. Scaphyglottis bifida is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight.
