    "intro": "Solanum profunderugosum, commonly known as the deep-veined nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. Its fruits are typically berries that change color from green to red as they mature. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
