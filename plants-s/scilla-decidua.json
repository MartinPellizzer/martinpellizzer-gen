    "intro": "Scilla decidua, commonly known as the Mediterranean squill, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blue or purple flowers in spring. The plant is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which wither and die back in the summer heat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Scilla decidua is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its early blooming habit."
