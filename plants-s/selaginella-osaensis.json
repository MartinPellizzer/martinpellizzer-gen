    "intro": "Selaginella osaensis, commonly known as the Osa fern moss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in whorls around the stem. This plant is native to the humid, shaded environments of the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Selaginella osaensis is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures, including microspores and megaspores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
