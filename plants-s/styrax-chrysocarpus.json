    "intro": "Styrax chrysocarpus, commonly known as the golden fruit styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive yellow, fleshy fruits that mature in late summer. These fruits are edible for birds and small mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. Its ornamental value comes from its showy flowers and unique fruiting structures, making it a popular choice in gardens."
