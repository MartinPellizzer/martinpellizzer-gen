    "intro": "Sarcochilus spathibrachiatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed sarcochilus, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with long, narrow petals. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
