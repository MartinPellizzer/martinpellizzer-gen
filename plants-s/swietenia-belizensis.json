It belongs to the Meliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark reddish-brown wood. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while the flowers are small and yellow-green in color. This species is valued for its high-quality timber but is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
