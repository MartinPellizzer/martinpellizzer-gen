    "intro": "Saxifraga arundana var. carpetana, commonly known as the carpet saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained conditions."
