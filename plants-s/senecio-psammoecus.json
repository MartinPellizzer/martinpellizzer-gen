    "intro": "Senecio psammoecus, commonly known as the sand dune groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy, coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio psammoecus plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
