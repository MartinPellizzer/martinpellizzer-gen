    "intro": "Smilax schomburgkiana var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender smilax, is a vigorous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features sharp, spiny stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its aggressive growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
