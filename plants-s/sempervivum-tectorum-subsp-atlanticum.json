    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the western coast of Europe. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. This subspecies is particularly adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and moderate frost."
