    "intro": "Silene acaulis subsp. acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant or rock campion, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, reducing water loss in arid conditions. Silene acaulis subsp. acaulis is often found growing on rocky slopes and in mountainous areas where it thrives in well-drained soils."
