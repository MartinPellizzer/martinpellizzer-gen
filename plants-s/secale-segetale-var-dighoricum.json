    "intro": "Secale segetale var. dighoricum, commonly known as the Dighori rye grass, is a variant of the rye grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
