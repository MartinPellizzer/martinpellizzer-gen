It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly rough texture. Spicanta pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
