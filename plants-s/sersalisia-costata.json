    "intro": "Sersalisia costata, commonly known as the serrated leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaf margins and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Sersalisia costata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
