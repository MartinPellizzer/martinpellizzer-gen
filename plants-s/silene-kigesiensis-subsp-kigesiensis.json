    "intro": "Silene kigesiensis subsp. kigesiensis, commonly known as the Kigesi catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems that often grow in open, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine environment. Silene kigesiensis subsp. kigesiensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
