It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
