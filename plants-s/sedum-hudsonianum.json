    "intro": "Sedum hudsonianum, commonly known as the Hudson's Bay sedum, is a species of flowering plant native to northern regions of North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Sedum hudsonianum is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
