    "intro": "Spaerocephalus dahuricus, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in showy, bell-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
