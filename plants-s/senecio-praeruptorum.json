    "intro": "Senecio praeruptorum, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio praeruptorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
