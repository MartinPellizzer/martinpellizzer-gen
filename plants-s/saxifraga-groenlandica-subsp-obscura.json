    "intro": "Saxifraga groenlandica subsp. obscura, commonly known as the Greenland saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky and coastal environments, thriving in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features dark green, broad leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters during the short summer season. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds."
