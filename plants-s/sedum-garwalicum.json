    "intro": "Sedum garwalicum, commonly known as the Garwal stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped flowers, usually in shades of yellow or orange, during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Sedum garwalicum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
