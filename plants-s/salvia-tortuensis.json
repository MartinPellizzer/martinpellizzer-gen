    "intro": "Salvia tortuensis, commonly known as the twisted sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Salvia tortuensis is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
