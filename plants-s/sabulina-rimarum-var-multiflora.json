    "intro": "Sabulina rimarum var. multiflora, commonly known as the sandstone saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky, arid environments. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on slopes or among rocks. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its resilience in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
