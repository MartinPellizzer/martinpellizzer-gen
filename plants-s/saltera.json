    "intro": "Saltera, commonly known as the saltbush, is a hardy shrub native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant thrives in soils with high salt content, making it a valuable species for reclaiming degraded land. Its flowers are typically green or yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits. Saltera is widely used in landscaping and as a forage plant for livestock in dry regions."
