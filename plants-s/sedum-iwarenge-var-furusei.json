    "intro": "Sedum iwarenge var. furusei, commonly known as the Japanese stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant. It is also drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, adding ornamental value to gardens with its compact growth habit."
