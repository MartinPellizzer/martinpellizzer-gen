    "intro": "Sibbaldia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sibbaldia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
