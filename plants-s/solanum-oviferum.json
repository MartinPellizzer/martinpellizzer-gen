    "intro": "Solanum oviferum, commonly known as the \"Cape gooseberry,\" is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into oval, fleshy fruits covered in a waxy coating. These fruits are typically orange to red in color when ripe and are edible when fully mature. Solanum oviferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions."
