    "intro": "Sulcorebutia torotorensis, commonly known as the Torotore cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, segmented stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
