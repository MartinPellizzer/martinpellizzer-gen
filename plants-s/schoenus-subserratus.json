    "intro": "Schoenus subserratus, commonly known as the serrated bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, lakeshores, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered spikelets that are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Schoenus subserratus plays an important ecological role in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
