    "intro": "Stelis lauta, commonly known as the broad-leafed stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that can reach several feet in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale yellow. Stelis lauta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot."
