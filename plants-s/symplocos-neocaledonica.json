    "intro": "Symplocos neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian wax tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, woody fruits containing single seeds. Symplocos neocaledonica is well adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings outside its native range."
