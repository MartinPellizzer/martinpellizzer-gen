    "intro": "Sida venosa, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Sida venosa is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural fields and gardens."
