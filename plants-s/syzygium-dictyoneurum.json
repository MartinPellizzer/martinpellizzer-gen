    "intro": "Syzygium dictyoneurum, commonly known as the broad-leaved tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sour fruits resembling small, elongated pods. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical forests. Syzygium dictyoneurum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential economic uses."
