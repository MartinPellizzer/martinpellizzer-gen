    "intro": "Schinnongia, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Schinnongia species are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters, and their leaves are usually basal and arranged in a rosette. They are generally perennial and have a compact growth habit, making them well-suited for harsh climates. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
