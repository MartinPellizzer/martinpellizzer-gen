    "intro": "Salvia adenophora, commonly known as the wooly sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and spikes of violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Salvia adenophora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
