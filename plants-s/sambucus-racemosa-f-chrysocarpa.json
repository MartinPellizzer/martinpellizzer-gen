    "intro": "Sambucus racemosa f. chrysocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited elderberry, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is a naturally occurring form of the common elderberry, characterized by its bright yellow berries, which contrast with the typical black or red fruits of the species. The plant features compound leaves with five to nine leaflets, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in herbal medicine."
