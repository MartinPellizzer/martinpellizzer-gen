    "intro": "Salix austinae, commonly known as Austina's willow, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its slender branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Its botanical features are adapted to the harsh, cold, and arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Salix austinae faces significant conservation challenges."
