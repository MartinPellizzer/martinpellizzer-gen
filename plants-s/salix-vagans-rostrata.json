    "intro": "Salix vagans rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Salix vagans rostrata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates."
