    "intro": "Salix exigua var. tenerrima, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and wet meadows. The leaves and branches are used in traditional medicine and have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory properties."
