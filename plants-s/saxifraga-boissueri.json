    "intro": "Saxifraga boissueri, commonly known as the Boissier's saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils. The plant features basal rosettes of pale green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Saxifraga boissueri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
