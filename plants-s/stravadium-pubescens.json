    "intro": "Stravadium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy stravadium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features upright, slender stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Stravadium pubescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
