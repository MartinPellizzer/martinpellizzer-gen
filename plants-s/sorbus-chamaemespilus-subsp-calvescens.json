    "intro": "Sorbus chamaemespilus subsp. calvescens, commonly known as the creeping whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, often on limestone soils, and can form dense thickets. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and grayish-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, yellowish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by bright red, persistent berries that provide food for birds. The subspecies is notable for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
