    "intro": "Salix lanceolata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are notably large, often reaching up to 10 cm in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it blooms in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
