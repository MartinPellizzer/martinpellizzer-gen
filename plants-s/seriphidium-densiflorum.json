    "intro": "Seriphidium densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower tansy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. Its foliage is usually gray-green with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets."
