    "intro": "Streblosa, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads resembling those of true dandelions. Streblosa species are often used in herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
