    "intro": "Schoenus capillaceus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in wetland environments such as marshes and lake margins. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale pink flowers. Schoenus capillaceus is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Its botanical structure reflects its classification within the grass family, Poaceae."
