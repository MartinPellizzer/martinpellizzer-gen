    "intro": "Solanum angustispinosum, commonly known as the narrow-spined nightshade, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by berries that range in color from green to red. It is adapted to a variety of habitats, including dry forests and shrublands, and is often found in areas with well-drained soil. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
