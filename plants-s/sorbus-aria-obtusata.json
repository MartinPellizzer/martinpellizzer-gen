    "intro": "Sorbus aria obtusata, commonly known as the whitebeam, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically oval or elliptic with a rounded base and are often covered in fine hairs. The bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured and flaky with age, adding to its distinctive appearance."
