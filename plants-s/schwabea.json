    "intro": "Schwabea, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America, Europe, and Asia. Schwabea species are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in herbal medicine."
