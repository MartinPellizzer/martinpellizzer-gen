    "intro": "Salix planifolia subsp. pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, elongated leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
