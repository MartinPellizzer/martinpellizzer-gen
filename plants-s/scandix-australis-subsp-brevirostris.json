    "intro": "Scandix australis subsp. brevirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a herbaceous annual with a compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by animals. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and inland plains. Due to its distinctive morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
