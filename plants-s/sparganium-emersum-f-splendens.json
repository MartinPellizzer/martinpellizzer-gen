    "intro": "Sparganium emersum f. splendens, commonly known as the golden bur reed, is a striking aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters in Europe and Asia. It is a variant of the common bur reed, distinguished by its vivid yellow to orange bracts that give it a fiery appearance. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with tall, narrow leaves that rise from a rhizomatous root system. Its flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. This ornamental plant is valued for its vibrant color and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
