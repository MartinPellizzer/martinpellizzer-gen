It is characterized by its dense, clustered leaves that form a compact, rounded canopy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and landscape gardening."
