It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a striking golden hue on the edges. The plant produces upright flowering stems that bear clusters of star-shaped, yellowish flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in a variety of climates, though it prefers full sun and cooler temperatures."
