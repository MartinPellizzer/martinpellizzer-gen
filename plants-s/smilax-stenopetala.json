    "intro": "Smilax stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled smilax, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a woody vine characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some wildlife. Smilax stenopetala thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
