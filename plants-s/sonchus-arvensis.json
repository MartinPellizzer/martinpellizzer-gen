    "intro": "Sonchus arvensis, commonly known as common sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and alternate, rough, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are surrounded by a series of bracts. It is native to Europe and Asia but has become naturalized in many parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
