    "intro": "Sorghum vulgare var. sudanense, commonly known as Sudan grass, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and large, fluffy panicles that produce seeds. This variety is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable forage crop. It is often used for livestock feed and erosion control due to its rapid growth and deep root system. The plant's botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system that enhances soil stability."
