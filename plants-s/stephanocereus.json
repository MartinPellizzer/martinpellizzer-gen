    "intro": "Stephanocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. They produce large, showy flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value. Stephanocereus plants are adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water requirements."
