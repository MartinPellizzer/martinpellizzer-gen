    "intro": "Salix rigida subsp. watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's willow, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its often arid or semi-arid habitat. It produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native range."
