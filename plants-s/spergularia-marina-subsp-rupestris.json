It is a small, mat-forming perennial that thrives in coastal environments, particularly on sandy or shingle shores. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in salty, windy conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is often found in intertidal zones along the Atlantic coast."
