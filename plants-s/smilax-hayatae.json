    "intro": "Smilax hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese arrowroot or Japanese smilax, is a flowering plant native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial vine characterized by its woody stems and spiny projections, which help it climb and defend itself. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Smilax hayatae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
