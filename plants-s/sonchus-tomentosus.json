    "intro": "Sonchus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, white tomentum, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
