    "intro": "Selaginella chuweimingii, commonly known as the Chuweiming mossy spikemoss, is a rare and recently discovered species of spikemoss native to China. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate, and intricately branched stems. The plant exhibits a unique combination of vascular and non-vascular traits, making it an interesting subject for botanical research. Its leaves are spirally arranged and often covered with a thin, waxy cuticle, which helps in reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
