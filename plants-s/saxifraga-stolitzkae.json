    "intro": "Saxifraga stolitzkae, commonly known as the Stolitzka's saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with rosettes of fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
