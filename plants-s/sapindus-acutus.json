    "intro": "Sapindus acutus, commonly known as the Chinese soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The tree produces spherical, spiny fruits that contain a single seed, and the fruit's outer layer is often used in traditional medicine. Its bark and leaves have been utilized for their saponin content, which produces a soapy lather when mixed with water. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
