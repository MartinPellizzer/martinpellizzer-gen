    "intro": "Statice halleri, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue, purple, or white flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds contributes to its resilience in harsh maritime conditions. Statice halleri is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize dunes."
