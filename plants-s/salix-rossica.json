    "intro": "Salix rossica, commonly known as Ross's willow, is a species of willow native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in tundra or taiga environments. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. Its flowers are catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it produces small, winged seeds for wind dispersal. Salix rossica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and subarctic wildlife."
