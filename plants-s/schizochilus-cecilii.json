    "intro": "Schizochilus cecilii, commonly known as the Cecil's schizochilus, is a rare and lesser-known species within the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a unique structure with its stipules forming a protective sheath around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to researchers studying plant diversity in tropical ecosystems."
