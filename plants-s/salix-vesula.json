    "intro": "Salix vesula, commonly known as the small-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are the primary means of wind pollination, and small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as stream banks, wetlands, and marshes. Salix vesula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
