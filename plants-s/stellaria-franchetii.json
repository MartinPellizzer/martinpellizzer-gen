    "intro": "Stellaria franchetii, commonly known as the Franchet's starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like carnations and chickweed. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling stars, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Stellaria franchetii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas."
