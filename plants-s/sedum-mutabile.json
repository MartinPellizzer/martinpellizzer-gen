    "intro": "Sedum mutabile, commonly known as the everlasting ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. Its common name reflects its ability to remain fresh and unchanged for long periods, even after being dried. Sedum mutabile is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
