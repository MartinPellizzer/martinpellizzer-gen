    "intro": "Salix wallichiana var. sericea, commonly known as the silver willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its striking silvery-gray bark. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
