    "intro": "Salix arctica subvar. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf Arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its presence is an indicator of tundra and subarctic ecosystems."
