    "intro": "Silene psammitis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water, reflecting its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub or coastal dunes. Silene psammitis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for native pollinators."
