    "intro": "Sempervivum monanthes var. murale, commonly known as the Alpine houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces upright, flowering stems that bear small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
