    "intro": "Silene rosulata var. ciliata, commonly known as the fringed rock-cress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often adorned with fine cilia along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
