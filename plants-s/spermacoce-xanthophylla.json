    "intro": "Spermacoce xanthophylla, commonly known as yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruit is a schizocarp consisting of two mericarps. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators. The plant's name derives from the yellow color of its flowers and the rattling sound its fruits make when dry."
