    "intro": "Santalodes wallichianum, commonly known as the Himalayan sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other trees. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant, woody stems that emit a resinous scent. It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including the Himalayas, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in its native habitat."
