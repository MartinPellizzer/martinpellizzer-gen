    "intro": "Soldanella alpina f. crenatifolia, commonly known as the alpine soldanella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. The leaves are crenate, meaning they have notched edges, which is a distinguishing characteristic of this form. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This plant is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
