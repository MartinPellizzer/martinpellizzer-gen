    "intro": "Symphyotrichum puniceum var. scabricaule, commonly known as the rough-stemmed heath aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. This variety is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is valued for its ornamental qualities in native plant gardens."
