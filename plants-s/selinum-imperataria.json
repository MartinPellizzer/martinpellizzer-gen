    "intro": "Selinum imperataria, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly leaves and spiky, blue or purple flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Selinum imperataria is also valued for its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
