    "intro": "Stanmarkia medialis, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Stanmarkia medialis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
