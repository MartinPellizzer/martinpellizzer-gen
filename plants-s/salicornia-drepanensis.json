It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it tolerates high salt concentrations. The plant has jointed, succulent stems that are often reddish in color and bear small, scale-like leaves. It produces tiny, green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Salicornia drepanensis is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
