    "intro": "Solanum depexum, commonly known as the creeping nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with sprawling stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its small, white or purple flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
