It features fleshy, upright stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in challenging landscapes."
