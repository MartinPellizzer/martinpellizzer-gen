    "intro": "Sophia glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular sophia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a distinctive, twisted appearance. The plant typically grows in woodland or shrubland habitats and prefers well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a glandular surface, which contributes to its scientific name. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
