    "intro": "Strombosia rapaneoides, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a strong, woody stem with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Strombosia rapaneoides is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
