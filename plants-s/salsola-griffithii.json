    "intro": "Salsola griffithii, commonly known as Indian blite, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Salsola griffithii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
