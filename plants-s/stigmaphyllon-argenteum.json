    "intro": "Stigmaphyllon argenteum, commonly known as silver leaf stigmaphyllon, is a flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering its leaves. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Stigmaphyllon argenteum is typically found in rocky or coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
