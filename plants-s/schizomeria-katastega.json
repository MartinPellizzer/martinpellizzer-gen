    "intro": "Schizomeria katastega, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and gray-green foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Schizomeria katastega is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
