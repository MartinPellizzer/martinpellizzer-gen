It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Spergula apetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
