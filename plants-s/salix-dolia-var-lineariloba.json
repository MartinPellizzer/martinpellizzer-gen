    "intro": "Salix dolia var. lineariloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically yellow-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and ornamental horticulture."
