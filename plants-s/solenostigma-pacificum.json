    "intro": "Solenostigma pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific solenostigma, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
