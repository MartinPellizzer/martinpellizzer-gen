    "intro": "Salix canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in coastal and mountainous areas, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
