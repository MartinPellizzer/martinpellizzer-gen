    "intro": "Sagittaria variabilis var. diversifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a water plant native to North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or extend underwater, with a distinctive broad, waxy leaf blade. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for wetland restoration and aquatic gardening."
