    "intro": "Strobilanthes slamatensis, commonly known as the \"Himalayan flame flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its blooming period occurs during the monsoon season, and it is known for its striking visual impact in its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
