It is a shrub or small tree with distinctive, narrow, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
