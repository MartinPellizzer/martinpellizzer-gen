    "intro": "Saxifraga martini, commonly known as the Alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are generally basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Saxifraga martini is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
