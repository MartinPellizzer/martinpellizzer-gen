    "intro": "Senecio mikaniiformis, commonly known as the creeping groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often spreading rapidly through runners. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
