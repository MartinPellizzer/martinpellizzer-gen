    "intro": "Sersalisia djalonensis, commonly known as the West African sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody scent, which is similar to that of sandalwood. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Sersalisia djalonensis is valued for its unique fragrance and has been traditionally used in local perfumery and medicinal practices. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
