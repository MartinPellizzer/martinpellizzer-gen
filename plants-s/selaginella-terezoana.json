It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
