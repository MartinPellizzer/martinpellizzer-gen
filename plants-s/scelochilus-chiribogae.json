    "intro": "Scelochilus chiribogae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated flower spikes that bear small, fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Scelochilus chiribogae is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
