    "intro": "Saxifraga rivularis subsp. rivularis, commonly known as the river saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist, rocky habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows in stream banks, wet meadows, and other waterlogged environments, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features basal rosettes of elliptic, dark green leaves with a waxy texture, and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil. This subspecies is often found in mountainous and alpine regions, where it plays a role in preventing erosion in its wetland habitats."
