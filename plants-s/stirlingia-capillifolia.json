    "intro": "Stirlingia capillifolia, commonly known as the slender-stemmed bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-covered stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Stirlingia capillifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
