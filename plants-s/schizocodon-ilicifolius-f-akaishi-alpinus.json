    "intro": "Schizocodon ilicifolius f. akaishi-alpinus, commonly known as the alpine holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to high-altitude regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with leathery, lance-shaped leaves that resemble holly leaves, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a dense, bushy appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. This fern is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones."
