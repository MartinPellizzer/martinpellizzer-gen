    "intro": "Schismatoglottis conoidea, commonly known as the conical schismatoglottis, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, it is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often curved inflorescence. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, conical shape that sets it apart from other orchids. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a difficult plant to cultivate outside its native environment."
