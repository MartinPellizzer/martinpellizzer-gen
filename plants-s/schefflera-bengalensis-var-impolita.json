    "intro": "Schefflera bengalensis var. impolita, commonly known as the Bengal Schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of palmate leaves, which are typically leathery and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
