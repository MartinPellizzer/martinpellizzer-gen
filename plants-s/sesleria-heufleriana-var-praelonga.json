    "intro": "Sesleria heufleriana var. praelonga, commonly known as the long-stemmed heufler's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable addition to native plant collections."
