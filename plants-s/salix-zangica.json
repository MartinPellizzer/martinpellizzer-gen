    "intro": "Salix zangica, commonly known as the Tibet willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and western China. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender branches and small, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its frost-resistant properties. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. Salix zangica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
