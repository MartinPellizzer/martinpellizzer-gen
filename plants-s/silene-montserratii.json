    "intro": "Silene montserratii, commonly known as the Montserrat catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the island of Montserrat in the Caribbean. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Silene montserratii is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and endemic species."
