    "intro": "Strophanthus boivinii var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the African milkvine, is a climbing shrub native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers, which are typically clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces woody, cylindrical fruit capsules that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though its milky sap can be toxic."
