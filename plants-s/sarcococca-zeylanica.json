    "intro": "Sarcococca zeylanica, commonly known as the Indian boxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern and southeastern Asia. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact form and foliage. Sarcococca zeylanica is also valued for its ability to tolerate moist, acidic soils and its low maintenance requirements."
