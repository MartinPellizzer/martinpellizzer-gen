    "intro": "Stipagrostis pennata subsp. minor, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil quality. This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
