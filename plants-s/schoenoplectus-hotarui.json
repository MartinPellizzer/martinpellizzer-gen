It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize shorelines. Its stems are cylindrical and often have a reddish tinge, while its leaves are grass-like and narrow. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
