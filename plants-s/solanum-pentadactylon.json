    "intro": "Solanum pentadactylon, commonly known as the five-finger nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with five lobes, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into berries containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings and is considered a weed in some regions."
