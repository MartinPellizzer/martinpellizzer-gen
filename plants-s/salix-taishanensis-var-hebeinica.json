    "intro": "Salix taishanensis var. hebeinica, commonly known as the Taishan weeping willow, is a variant of the weeping willow native to China. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
