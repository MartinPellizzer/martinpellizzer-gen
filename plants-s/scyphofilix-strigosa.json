    "intro": "Scyphofilix strigosa, commonly known as the hairy scyphofilix, is a rare and elusive plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the carrot family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Scyphofilix strigosa is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
