    "intro": "Strobus koraiensis, commonly known as the Korean fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a conical shape and a dense crown. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. The cones of Strobus koraiensis are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
