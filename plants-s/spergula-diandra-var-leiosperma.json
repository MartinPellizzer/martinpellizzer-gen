    "intro": "Spergula diandra var. leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless or only slightly hairy, and its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
