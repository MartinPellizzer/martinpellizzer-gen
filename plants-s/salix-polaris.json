    "intro": "Salix polaris, commonly known as the polar willow, is a shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is one of the few willow species that grows in permanently frozen ground, adapting to extreme cold and short growing seasons. The plant has slender, often prostrate stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, elliptical seeds. Salix polaris plays a crucial role in stabilizing permafrost soils and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
