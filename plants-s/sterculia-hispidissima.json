    "intro": "Sterculia hispidissima, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sterculia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
