    "intro": "Streptanthera, commonly known as the spurred gentian, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae. These plants are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, blue or violet flowers that often have spurred petals, which are adaptations for pollination by specific insects. Streptanthera species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Their botanical features include opposite leaves and a capsule fruit that disperses seeds through wind or animals."
