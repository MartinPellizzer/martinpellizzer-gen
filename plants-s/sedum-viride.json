    "intro": "Sedum viride, commonly known as the green stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Sedum viride is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
