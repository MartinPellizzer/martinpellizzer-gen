    "intro": "Saccolabium monticola, commonly known as the mountain saccolabium, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in dry gardens."
