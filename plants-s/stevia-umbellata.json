    "intro": "Stevia umbellata, commonly known as the sweetleaf or honey plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant produces sweet-tasting leaves that contain steviol glycosides, natural compounds used as a sugar substitute. Stevia umbellata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, aromatic plants. Its medicinal and culinary uses have made it a valuable species in both traditional and modern herbal practices."
