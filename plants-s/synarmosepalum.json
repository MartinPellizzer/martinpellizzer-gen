    "intro": "Synarmosepalum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a variety of colors. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. Its flowers are typically tubular and have five petals that are fused at the base, a feature known as synandry. Synarmosepalum is also noted for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional Andean medicine for centuries."
