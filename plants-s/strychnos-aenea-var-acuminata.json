    "intro": "Strychnos aenea var. acuminata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
