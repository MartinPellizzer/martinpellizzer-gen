    "intro": "Sophora angustifolia var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early summer, typically in shades of blue or purple, which are followed by elongated seed pods. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. However, it can be invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
