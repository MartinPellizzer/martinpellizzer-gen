    "intro": "Selaginella caribensis, commonly known as the Caribbean spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and a creeping rhizome system. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique ability to survive desiccation, a trait known as poikilohydry, which allows it to withstand periods of drought. Its reproductive structures, including microsporangia and megasporangia, are borne on specialized structures called strobila, typical of the spore-producing plants in the Selaginellaceae family."
