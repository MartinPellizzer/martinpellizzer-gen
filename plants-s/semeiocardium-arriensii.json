    "intro": "Semeiocardium arriensii, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and sepals that resemble a bell shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Semeiocardium arriensii is considered a conservation concern."
