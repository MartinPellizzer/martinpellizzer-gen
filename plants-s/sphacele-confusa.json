    "intro": "Sphacele confusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes plants commonly known as nettles. The plant has slender, opposite leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, with a hairy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Sphacele confusa is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its lack of stinging hairs, distinguishing it from true nettles."
