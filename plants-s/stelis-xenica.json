It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying shades of white and purple, and bloom during the wet season. Stelis xenica is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
