    "intro": "Salix rorida var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a variant of the willow tree characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often silvery-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The species is known for its rapid growth and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its graceful, flowing form."
