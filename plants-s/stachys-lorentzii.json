    "intro": "Stachys lorentzii, commonly known as Lorentz's hedge nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
