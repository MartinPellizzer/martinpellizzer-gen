    "intro": "Syngonium salvadorense, commonly known as the Salvadoran arrowhead, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by spadices that contain the true flowers. Syngonium salvadorense thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the ground or climb up supports, making it a popular ornamental plant in certain regions."
