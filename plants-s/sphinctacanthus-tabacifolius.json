    "intro": "Sphinctacanthus tabacifolius, commonly known as the tobacco leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that resemble tobacco leaves, which are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
