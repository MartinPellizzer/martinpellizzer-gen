    "intro": "Sison pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf sison, is a small herbaceous plant native to the Philippines. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters and features delicate, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
