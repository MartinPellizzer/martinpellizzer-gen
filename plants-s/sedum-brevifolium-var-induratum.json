    "intro": "Sedum brevifolium var. induratum, commonly known as the hardy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience to drought and cold makes it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
