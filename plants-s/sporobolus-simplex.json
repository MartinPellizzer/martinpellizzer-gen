    "intro": "Sporobolus simplex, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical seed heads that resemble bottle brushes, which are often brightly colored and attract pollinators. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. It grows in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and rocky areas. Botanically, it is classified in the Poaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
