    "intro": "Sida montana f. multicrena, commonly known as the multibract sida, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with bracts that are distinctly larger than the actual flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
