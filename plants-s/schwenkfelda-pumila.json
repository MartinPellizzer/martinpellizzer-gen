    "intro": "Schwenkfelda pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pumila, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant is known for its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments, including compact growth and specialized root systems. Schwenkfelda pumila is primarily found in rocky or alpine soils, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
