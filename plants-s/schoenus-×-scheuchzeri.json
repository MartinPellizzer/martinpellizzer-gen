    "intro": "Schoenus \u00d7 scheuchzeri, commonly known as the hybrid reed, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a stabilizing plant in aquatic environments."
