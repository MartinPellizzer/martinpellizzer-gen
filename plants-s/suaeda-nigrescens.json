    "intro": "Suaeda nigrescens, commonly known as black saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought and high salt concentrations. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds via wind. Suaeda nigrescens plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
