    "intro": "Salix repens var. subopposita, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a variant of the common willow that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a soft, hairy texture on the underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other riparian habitats."
