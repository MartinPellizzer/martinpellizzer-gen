    "intro": "Sorbus chamaemespilus f. grosseserrata, commonly known as the roughleaf whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rocky or woodland gardens. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
