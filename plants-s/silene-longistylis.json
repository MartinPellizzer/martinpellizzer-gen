    "intro": "Silene longistylis, commonly known as the long-styled catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated styles that extend beyond the petals. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Silene longistylis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
