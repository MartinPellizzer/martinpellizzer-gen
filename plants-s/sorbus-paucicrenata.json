    "intro": "Sorbus paucicrenata, commonly known as the few-crenated whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive serrated margin."
