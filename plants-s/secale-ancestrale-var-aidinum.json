    "intro": "Secale ancestrale var. aidinum, commonly known as the Armenian ryegrass, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typically in shades of green or brown. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical and genetic studies."
