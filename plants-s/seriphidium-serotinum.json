    "intro": "Seriphidium serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across suitable habitats. Seriphidium serotinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
