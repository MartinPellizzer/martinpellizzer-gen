    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 jaeggiana, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. Its foliage is typically succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments."
