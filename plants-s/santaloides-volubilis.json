    "intro": "Santaloides volubilis, commonly known as the climbing sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, often attaching itself to trees through haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or green in color. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can germinate in the presence of a suitable host. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
