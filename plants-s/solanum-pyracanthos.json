It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is necessary due to its toxic properties."
