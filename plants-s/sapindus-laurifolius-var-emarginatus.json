    "intro": "Sapindus laurifolius var. emarginatus, commonly known as the margined soapberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-9 lobed and have a distinctive emarginate or notched appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits that contain a single seed. The fruit's surface is covered with a thick, soapy substance that gives the plant its common name. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses."
