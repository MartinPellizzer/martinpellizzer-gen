    "intro": "Solidago rupicola, commonly known as rock goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and woodland edges. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in dense, hairy foliage. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, producing clusters of small, composite flower heads. Solidago rupicola is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
