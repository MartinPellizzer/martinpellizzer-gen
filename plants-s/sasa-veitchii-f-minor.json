    "intro": "Sasa veitchii f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a low-growing, clump-forming plant native to Japan. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, dark green culms and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for ground cover. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is well-suited for rock gardens and container planting."
