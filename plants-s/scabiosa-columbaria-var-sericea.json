It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pink or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is a perennial species that produces seeds through its showy blooms, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The variety 'sericea' is distinguished by its silky, silver-tomentose foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance."
