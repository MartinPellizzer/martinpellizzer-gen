    "intro": "Sabal floribunda, commonly known as the Florida sabal, is a palm-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 6 feet in diameter. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters at the top of the plant, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils."
