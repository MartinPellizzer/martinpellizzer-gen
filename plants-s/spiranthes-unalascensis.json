    "intro": "Spiranthes unalascensis, commonly known as the Alaskan ladies' tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the coastal regions of Alaska and northern British Columbia. It is characterized by its delicate, spiraling arrangement of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as bogs and wet meadows. It has linear, grass-like leaves and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
