    "intro": "Schizachyrium praematurum f. hirtivaginatum, commonly known as the hairy bracted bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which appear in late summer. Its hairy bracts are a distinguishing feature, giving it the specific epithet *hirtivaginatum*. This grass is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows."
