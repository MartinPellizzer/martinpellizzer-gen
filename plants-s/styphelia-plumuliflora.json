    "intro": "Styphelia plumuliflora, commonly known as the plumose styphelia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces delicate, white, woolly flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a soft, ethereal appearance to its compact form. Styphelia plumuliflora thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique floral display and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
