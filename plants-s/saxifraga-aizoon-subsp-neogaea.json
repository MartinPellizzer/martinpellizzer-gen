    "intro": "Saxifraga aizoon subsp. neogaea, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
