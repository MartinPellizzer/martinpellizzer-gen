It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. Its flowers are usually pale purple to blue, arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. Scrophularia serrata is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
