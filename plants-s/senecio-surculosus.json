It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
