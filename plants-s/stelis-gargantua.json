    "intro": "Stelis gargantua, commonly known as the giant stelis, is a striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as pink, white, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding debris. The genus Stelis is known for its diverse floral structures, and S. gargantua exemplifies this with its unique, spurred petals and intricate floral morphology."
