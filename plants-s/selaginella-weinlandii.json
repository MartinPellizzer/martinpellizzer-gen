    "intro": "Selaginella weinlandii, commonly known as the mountain spikemoss, is a vascular fern that belongs to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a low-growing plant that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with structures that help it retain moisture. Selaginella weinlandii is also notable for its ability to reproduce through spores, which it releases in specialized structures called sporangia."
