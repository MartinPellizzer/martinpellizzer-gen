It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making."
