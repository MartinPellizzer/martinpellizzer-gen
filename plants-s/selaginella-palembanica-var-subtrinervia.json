    "intro": "Selaginella palembanica var. subtrinervia, commonly known as the palembangan spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact rosette of needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly recurved. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are clustered in short, branched structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
