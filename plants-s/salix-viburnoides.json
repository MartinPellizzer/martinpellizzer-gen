    "intro": "Salix viburnoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant has slender, zigzagging stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries in the fall. Salix viburnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
