    "intro": "Stipa frigida var. parvispicula, commonly known as the small-headed frost grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted clumps of narrow, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers, which are adapted to cold and arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
