    "intro": "Senecio balsamitae, commonly known as Balsam weed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments, and it can spread aggressively through both seeds and vegetative growth. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
