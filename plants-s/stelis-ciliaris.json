    "intro": "Stelis ciliaris, commonly known as the ear-shaped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with numerous small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Stelis ciliaris is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is prized for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
