    "intro": "Solanum stenotomum f. chiar-ckati, commonly known as the brightleaf nightshade, is a unique variant of the Solanum stenotomum species. It is characterized by its strikingly bright green leaves with a waxy texture, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, typically yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it should be handled with care as it contains toxic compounds."
