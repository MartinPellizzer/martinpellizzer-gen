    "intro": "Sagina laxa, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal areas, dunes, and disturbed sites, making it a resilient and adaptable species. Sagina laxa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
