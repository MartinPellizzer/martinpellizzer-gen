It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and small, tubular blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The sticky residue on its leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
