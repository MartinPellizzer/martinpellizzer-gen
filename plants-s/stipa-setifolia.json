    "intro": "Stipa setifolia, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its fine, grass-like foliage makes it a valuable component of native plant communities. Stipa setifolia is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental appeal and as a source of forage for wildlife."
