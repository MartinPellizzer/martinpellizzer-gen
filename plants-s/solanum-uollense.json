    "intro": "Solanum uollense, commonly known as the yellow nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and toxic berries. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or wetland habitats. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture, while its stems are hairy and reddish in color. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but studied for its potential medicinal compounds."
