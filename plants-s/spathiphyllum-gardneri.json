    "intro": "Spathiphyllum gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's peace lily, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy, heart-shaped leaves and its striking white spatulate flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ease of care and aesthetic appeal. The spathe, which is the showy white part of the flower, is actually modified to protect the smaller, yellowish spadix inside."
