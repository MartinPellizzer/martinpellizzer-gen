    "intro": "Solanum himalense, commonly known as the Himalayan nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its berries, which are usually yellow or orange when mature, are toxic and should not be consumed. Solanum himalense is often found in moist, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters."
