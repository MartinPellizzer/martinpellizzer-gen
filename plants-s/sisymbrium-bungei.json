    "intro": "Sisymbrium bungei, commonly known as the Bunge's broomrape, is an annual plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and green color, as it is a parasitic plant that derives nutrients from its host through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, yellow flowers and has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Due to its parasitic nature, it can pose a challenge for agricultural crops."
