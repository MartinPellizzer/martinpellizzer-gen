    "intro": "Styrax leprosus f. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf styrax, is a variant of the styrax tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are typically broader than those of the standard species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, which are followed by orange-red berries. Its foliage provides aesthetic value, and it is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes. The plant prefers partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a range of garden conditions."
