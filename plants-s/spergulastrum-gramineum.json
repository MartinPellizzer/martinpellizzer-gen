    "intro": "Spergulastrum gramineum, commonly known as sea oats, is a coastal grass species native to the eastern coast of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are followed by narrow, spike-like seed heads. Sea oats are highly adapted to sandy, coastal environments and play a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its ability to thrive in saline and wind-swept conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
