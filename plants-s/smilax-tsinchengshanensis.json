    "intro": "Smilax tsinchengshanensis, commonly known as the Tsinchengshan devil's backbone, is a climbing shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, followed by berries that are toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
