    "intro": "Senecio calcarius, commonly known as the limestone groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky, limestone-rich environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a woolly texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Senecio calcarius is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
