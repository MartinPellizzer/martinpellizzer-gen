    "intro": "Statice rumicifolia, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of violet-blue flowers and silver-gray foliage. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its fleshy leaves and showy blooms make it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements. Statice rumicifolia is also valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion."
