    "intro": "Statice thouinii, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Statice thouinii is often used in ornamental gardening for its drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms."
