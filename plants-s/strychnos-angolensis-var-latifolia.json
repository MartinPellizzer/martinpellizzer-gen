    "intro": "Strychnos angolensis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved devil's backbone, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are broad and ovate, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its bark and roots contain toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine, which have historically been used in traditional medicine and as poisons. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in agricultural settings and requires caution during handling."
