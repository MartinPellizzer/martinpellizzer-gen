    "intro": "Sorbus verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of white, apple-like berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Sorbus verrucosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
