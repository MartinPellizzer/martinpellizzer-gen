    "intro": "Senegalia roemeriana, commonly known as the screwbean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep roots and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. Senegalia roemeriana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
