    "intro": "Salix mollissima, commonly known as silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silky gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, inconspicuous female flowers. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Salix mollissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
