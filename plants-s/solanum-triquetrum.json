    "intro": "Solanum triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a distinctive three-angled stem, giving it its scientific name. Solanum triquetrum contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
