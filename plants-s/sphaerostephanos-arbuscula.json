    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos arbuscula, commonly known as the small ball cactus, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa. It features a compact, globular stem with a dense covering of small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny exterior. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, typical of many cacti. Sphaerostephanos arbuscula is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem for survival."
