    "intro": "Sonchus maculigerus, commonly known as the spotted sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and features alternate, rough, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are surrounded by pale green to white bracts. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and waste areas. Sonchus maculigerus is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions."
