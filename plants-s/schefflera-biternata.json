It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, palmate leaves that are typically divided into three segments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Schefflera biternata is relatively low-maintenance and suitable for indoor cultivation in suitable light conditions."
