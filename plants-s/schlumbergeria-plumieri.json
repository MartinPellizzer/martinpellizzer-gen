    "intro": "[WRONG START] Schlumbergera plumieri, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, fleshy stems that form a branching, bushy structure. The plant produces vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the holiday season, typically from late November to January. Its leaves are modified stems that are often used for propagation. Schlumbergera plumieri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
