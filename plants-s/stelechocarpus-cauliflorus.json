    "intro": "Stelechocarpus cauliflorus, commonly known as the red-flowered tamanu, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces large, woody fruits that contain a single, large seed surrounded by a fleshy, orange-red aril. Its botanical features include palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and a thick, aromatic bark. The species is valued for its unique appearance and has limited commercial use due to its restricted distribution."
