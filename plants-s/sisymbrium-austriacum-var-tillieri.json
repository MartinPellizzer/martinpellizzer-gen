    "intro": "Sisymbrium austriacum var. tillieri, commonly known as the Austrian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in association with leguminous hosts such as Medicago species, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its small, yellow flowers are often overlooked due to its lack of visible foliage. This species is native to Central Europe and is considered a rare and specialized plant in its ecological niche."
