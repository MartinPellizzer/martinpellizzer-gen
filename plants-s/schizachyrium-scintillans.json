    "intro": "Schizachyrium scintillans, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass that thrives in prairie and woodland habitats. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage that turns coppery-red in the fall. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that add visual interest throughout the growing season. Little bluestem is drought-tolerant and well adapted to full sun, making it a valuable component of native plant gardens. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
