    "intro": "Solanum nigrum var. perennans, commonly known as the perennial black nightshade, is a variant of the black nightshade species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries, which turn from green to black as they mature. These berries are toxic when ripe but are sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, wastelands, and along roadsides."
