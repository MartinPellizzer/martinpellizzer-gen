    "intro": "Stelis rostriflora, commonly known as the rostriflorous orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Stelis rostriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
