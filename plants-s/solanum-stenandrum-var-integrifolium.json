    "intro": "Solanum stenandrum var. integrifolium, commonly known as the velvet leaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, followed by berries that mature to a deep blue or black. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
