    "intro": "Stelis lugoi, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a white or pale yellow coloration. Stelis lugoi thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
