    "intro": "Sedum controversum, commonly known as the debated stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
