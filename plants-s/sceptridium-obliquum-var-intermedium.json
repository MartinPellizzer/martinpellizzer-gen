    "intro": "Sceptridium obliquum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate clubmoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, branching structure that resembles a club. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It is often found in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe and Asia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
