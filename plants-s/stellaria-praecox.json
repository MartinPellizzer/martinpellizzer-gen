    "intro": "Stellaria praecox, commonly known as early starwort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom early in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly wavy margin. Stellaria praecox is often found in moist, disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in meadows."
