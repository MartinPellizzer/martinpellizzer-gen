    "intro": "Sarcochilus rarus, commonly known as the rare spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with long, thin pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces striking, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers with prominent sepals and petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
