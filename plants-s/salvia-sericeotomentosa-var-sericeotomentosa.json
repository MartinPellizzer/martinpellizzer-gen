It features upright stems covered in dense, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are lance-shaped, narrow, and also densely pubescent, contributing to its silvery hue. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
