    "intro": "Spirochaeta funckii, commonly known as the spiral-shaped bacterium, is a chemolithoautotrophic bacterium that derives energy from inorganic compounds. It is characterized by its distinctive helical shape and is often found in anaerobic environments such as freshwater sediments and soils. This bacterium plays a role in the nitrogen cycle by oxidizing ammonia. It is a Gram-negative organism with a complex cell wall structure. Spirochaeta funckii is of interest in biotechnology due to its unique metabolic capabilities."
