    "intro": "Salix krylovii, commonly known as Krylov's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
