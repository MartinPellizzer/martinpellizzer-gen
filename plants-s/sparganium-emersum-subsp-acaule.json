    "intro": "Sparganium emersum subsp. acaule, commonly known as the slender bur-reed, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that rise from a short, inconspicuous stem base, giving it its subspecific name \"acaule.\" The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers at the top of the stems, which are followed by spiky, seed-bearing structures. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, floating just above the water surface. This subspecies is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels and muddy substrates."
