    "intro": "Saponaria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock soapwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that are often tinged with red, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. Saponaria saxatilis thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has mild saponin compounds in its leaves, which give it a soapy texture when crushed."
