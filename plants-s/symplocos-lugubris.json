    "intro": "Symplocos lugubris, commonly known as the blackberry shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries in the fall. Its berries are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor, and the plant is often used in native landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Symplocos lugubris plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
