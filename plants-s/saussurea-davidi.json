    "intro": "Saussurea davidi, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, woolly foliage that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, often at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
