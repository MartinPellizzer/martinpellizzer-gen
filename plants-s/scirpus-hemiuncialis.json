    "intro": "Scirpus hemiuncialis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a tall, perennial wetland plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils along the edges of ponds, lakes, and marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive, cylindrical flower spike that appears in late summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Scirpus hemiuncialis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
