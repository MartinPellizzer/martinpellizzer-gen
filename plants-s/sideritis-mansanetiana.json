It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
