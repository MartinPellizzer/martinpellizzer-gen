    "intro": "Sagina diffusa, commonly known as common pearlwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Sagina diffusa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
