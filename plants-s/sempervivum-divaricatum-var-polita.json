    "intro": "Sempervivum divaricatum var. polita, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a succulent species native to the Pyrenees region. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white to bluish waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The leaves are fleshy and often have a slightly pointed appearance, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
