    "intro": "Silene secundiflora subsp. macrotheca, commonly known as the large-capsule catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
