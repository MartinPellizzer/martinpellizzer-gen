    "intro": "Salvia hypanica, commonly known as the Mexican sage, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Salvia hypanica is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
