    "intro": "Strombosia pustulata var. lucida, commonly known as the glossy strombosia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its bark is smooth and light-colored, with a distinctive peeling texture that reveals lighter inner layers. This variant is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
