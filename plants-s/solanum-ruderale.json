    "intro": "Solanum ruderale, commonly known as the common nightshade, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature, though they are toxic to humans and animals. Solanum ruderale often grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
