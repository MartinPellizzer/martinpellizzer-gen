    "intro": "Smilax cordato-ovata, commonly known as the heart-shaped smilax, is a perennial climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are usually dark green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Smilax cordato-ovata is a member of the family Smilacaceae and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense thickets in its native habitat."
