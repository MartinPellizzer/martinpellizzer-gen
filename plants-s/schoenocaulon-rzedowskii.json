    "intro": "Schoenocaulon rzedowskii, commonly known as the Rzedowskii's rockcress, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and its stems are short and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
