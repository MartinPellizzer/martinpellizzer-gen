    "intro": "Sabinea carinalis, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, needle-like leaves that are dense and provide excellent moisture retention. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal environments."
