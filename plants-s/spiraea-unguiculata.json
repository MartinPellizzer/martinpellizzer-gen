    "intro": "Spiraea unguiculata, commonly known as the meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy, flat-topped clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and finely toothed. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Spiraea unguiculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
