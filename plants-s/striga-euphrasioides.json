    "intro": "Striga euphrasioides, commonly known as the common witchweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and derives nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. This species is native to Africa and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is considered a weed that can significantly reduce the yield of crops such as millet and sorghum. The plant's small, yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences."
