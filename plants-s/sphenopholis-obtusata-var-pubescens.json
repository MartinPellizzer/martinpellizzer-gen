    "intro": "Sphenopholis obtusata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf sphenophytes, is a variant of the sphenophytes, which are ancient, spore-producing plants. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its structure includes a stem with whorled leaves and sporangia that produce spores for reproduction. The hairy texture of its leaves helps to reduce water loss and provides some protection against herbivory."
