    "intro": "Sagina apetala subsp. densa, commonly known as dense sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, closely packed leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or coastal environments. Due to its compact growth habit and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
