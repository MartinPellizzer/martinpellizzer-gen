    "intro": "Stifftia grazielae, commonly known as the Ocotillo, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that are covered in small, spiny leaves, which are shed during periods of drought. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Stifftia grazielae is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in extreme heat and limited water conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a distinctive and resilient species in desert ecosystems."
