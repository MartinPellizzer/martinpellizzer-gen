The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, linear leaves, and tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
