    "intro": "Solanum lyratum f. purpuratum, commonly known as the purple leaf groundcherry, is a cultivar of the groundcherry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking purple-tinged foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the species. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often harvested when they turn a vibrant red or yellow. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for both its foliage and fruit."
