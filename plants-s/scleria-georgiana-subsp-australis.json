    "intro": "Scleria georgiana subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and swampy areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-lobed flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering structure compared to other Scleria species."
