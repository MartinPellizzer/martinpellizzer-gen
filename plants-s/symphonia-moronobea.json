    "intro": "Symphonia moronobea, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and traditional crafts. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Symphonia moronobea is considered threatened in many parts of its range."
