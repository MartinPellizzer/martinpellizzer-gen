    "intro": "Sipanea pratensis f. glabriloba, commonly known as the glabrous form of the common sipanea, is a variant of the perennial herb native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are lanceolate and often lack the dense pubescence seen in the typical form. This subspecies is notable for its reduced hair coverage, which may contribute to its adaptation to specific environmental conditions."
