    "intro": "Sempervivum cernochii, commonly known as the bent-leaved houseleek, is a low-growing succulent native to the Alps. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that curve downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Sempervivum cernochii is also valued for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh alpine conditions."
