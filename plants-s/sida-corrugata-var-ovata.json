    "intro": "Sida corrugata var. ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its rough, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate or broadly elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Sida corrugata var. ovata is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
