    "intro": "Solidago chilensis var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sunny environments such as coastal areas and grasslands. The plant produces bright yellow inflorescences composed of numerous small, ray-like flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
