    "intro": "Sedum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid sedum, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Sedum rigidum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
