It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a distinctive umbrella-like pattern at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.
