    "intro": "Sideroxylon marginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a member of the family Olacaceae. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves. The plant is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth margin and a leathery texture. The flowers are small and usually yellow or greenish, arranged in clusters, and the plant produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind."
