    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 ludificans, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species within the willow genus. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that drape like curtains, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a light green color that turns yellow in autumn."
