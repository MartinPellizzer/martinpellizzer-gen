It belongs to the Loganiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is often found in forest understories and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with caution."
