    "intro": "Stellaria pallasiana, commonly known as the lesser starwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, arranged in a star-like pattern, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often hairy, and it thrives in moist, grassy habitats. Stellaria pallasiana is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges, where it blooms from late spring to early summer."
