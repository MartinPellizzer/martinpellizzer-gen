    "intro": "Selliguea daweishanensis, commonly known as the Daweishan moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species native to China. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate leaf structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its small, closely packed leaves are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent cells. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
