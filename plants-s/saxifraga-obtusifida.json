    "intro": "Saxifraga obtusifida, commonly known as the blunt-leaf saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga obtusifida is often found in high-altitude meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
