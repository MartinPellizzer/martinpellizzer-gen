    "intro": "Solanum sinuatum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
