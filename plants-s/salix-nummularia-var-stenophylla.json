    "intro": "Salix nummularia var. stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaved willow, is a shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
