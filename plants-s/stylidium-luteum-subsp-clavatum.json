It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its compact stature and vivid yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and grasslands. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common in many orchid species, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Stylidium luteum subsp. clavatum is adapted to arid environments and is often found in regions with seasonal rainfall."
