    "intro": "Saccolabium tenuicaule, commonly known as slender-stemmed saccolabium, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Saccolabium tenuicaule is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments."
