    "intro": "Selaginella geniculata subsp. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed clubmoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the sporangia for spore production. Its ability to survive in harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological studies and conservation efforts."
