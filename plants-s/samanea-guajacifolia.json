    "intro": "Samanea guajacifolia, commonly known as the Brazilwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and historical use in the production of dyes and musical instruments. The tree has a broad, umbrella-shaped canopy with pinnate leaves composed of several leaflets. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. Samanea guajacifolia thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests."
