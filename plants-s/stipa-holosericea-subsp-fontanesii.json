    "intro": "Stipa holosericea subsp. fontanesii, commonly known as the Fontanesii needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy surface, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
