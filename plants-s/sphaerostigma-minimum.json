    "intro": "Sphaerostigma minimum, commonly known as the small globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, rounded thallus structure. It typically grows on tree bark, stones, or soil in humid, temperate regions. The plant has a complex symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes a layered structure with a central, rounded body and a fringed margin. Sphaerostigma minimum is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and environmental health."
