    "intro": "Suaeda vera subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf sea blite, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss in arid or salty conditions. Suaeda vera subsp. longifolia plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
