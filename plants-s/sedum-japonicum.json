    "intro": "Sedum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it store water efficiently. Sedum japonicum is often used in ornamental horticulture for its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
