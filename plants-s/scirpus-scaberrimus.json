It is characterized by its stiff, ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy or rough to the touch. This plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are often subtended by bracts. Scirpus scaberrimus is often found in temperate regions and can be an indicator species for wetland habitats."
