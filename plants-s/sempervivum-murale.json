    "intro": "Sempervivum murale, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens and alpine settings. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or yellow during the summer months. Sempervivum murale is highly drought-tolerant and can survive in harsh conditions, which contributes to its reputation as a hardy and low-maintenance plant."
