    "intro": "Sonchidium palustre, commonly known as swamp groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in a composite head, which are surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Sonchidium palustre plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
