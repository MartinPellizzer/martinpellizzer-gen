    "intro": "Stachygynandrum obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor and spread in aquatic environments. Its fronds are typically divided into small, serrated segments, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Stachygynandrum obtusum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
