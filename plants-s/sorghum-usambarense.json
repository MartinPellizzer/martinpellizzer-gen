    "intro": "Sorghum usambarense, commonly known as the African millet, is a drought-tolerant grass native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce grains. The plant thrives in poor soil conditions and requires minimal water, making it an important crop in arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots system is extensive, aiding in soil stabilization. Sorghum usambarense is valued for its nutritional content and is used for both human consumption and animal feed."
