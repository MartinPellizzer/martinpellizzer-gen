    "intro": "Salix cardinalis, commonly known as the cardinal willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Salix cardinalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
