    "intro": "Salsola apterygea, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Salsola apterygea is commonly found in deserts, coastal dunes, and other dry habitats."
