    "intro": "Serjania spinosa, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or Brazilian rosewood, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a dense canopy and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces showy, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, often with a waxy coating. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds."
