    "intro": "Streptostachys ramosa, commonly known as the branched sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with numerous branched stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Streptostachys ramosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes."
