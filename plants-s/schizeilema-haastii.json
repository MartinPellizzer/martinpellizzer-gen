    "intro": "Schizeilema haastii, commonly known as the Haast's lily, is a striking flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pale blue or violet flowers with a distinctive, spurred shape. Schizeilema haastii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
