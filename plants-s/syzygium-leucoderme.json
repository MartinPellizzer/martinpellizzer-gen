    "intro": "Syzygium leucoderme, commonly known as the white-berried tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn from green to yellow as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface. Syzygium leucoderme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit, though it is less commonly used in culinary applications compared to other tamarind species."
