    "intro": "Sorghum bicolor var. rotundulum, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a compact, bushy plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its short stature, typically growing no taller than 1 to 2 meters, and its dense, rounded clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, two-lobed grains that are typically yellow or brown in color. It has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a forage crop for livestock."
