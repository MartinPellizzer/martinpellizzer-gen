    "intro": "Stanhopea marylenae, commonly known as the Marylene's stanhopea, is a rare orchid species native to the highlands of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that typically feature a combination of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, with lanceolate leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
