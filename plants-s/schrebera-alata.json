It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that have prominent veins running across their surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Schrebera alata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens."
