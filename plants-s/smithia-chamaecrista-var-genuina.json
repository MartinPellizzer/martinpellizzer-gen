    "intro": "Smithia chamaecrista var. genuina, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, stipitate leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia."
