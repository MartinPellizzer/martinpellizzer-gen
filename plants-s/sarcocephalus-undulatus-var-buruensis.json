    "intro": "Sarcocephalus undulatus var. buruensis, commonly known as the Buru sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with smooth, grayish bark and elliptical, opposite leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
