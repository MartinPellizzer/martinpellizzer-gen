    "intro": "Struthiopteris japonica, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies."
