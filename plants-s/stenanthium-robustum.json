    "intro": "Stenanthium robustum, commonly known as the robust marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and flies. Stenanthium robustum is a valuable component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and habitat structure."
