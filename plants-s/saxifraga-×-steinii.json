    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 steinii, commonly known as the rockfoil or cushion saxifrage, is a hybrid plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage that help it survive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
