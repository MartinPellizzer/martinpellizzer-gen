    "intro": "Saccharum bicorne, commonly known as the two-horned cane, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive two-tipped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant is a perennial, growing up to several meters in height, with long, narrow leaves. It thrives in wetlands and marshy areas, often forming dense stands. Saccharum bicorne is closely related to sugarcane and has been studied for its potential in biofuel production."
