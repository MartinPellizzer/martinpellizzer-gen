    "intro": "Sophronia pterocarpa, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its fragrant wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in incense and medicine. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
