    "intro": "Solanum dichotomum var. lyratum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often lobed or deeply divided. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. The species is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants."
