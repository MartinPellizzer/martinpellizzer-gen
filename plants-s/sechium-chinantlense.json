    "intro": "Sechium chinantlense, commonly known as the Chinantec pumpkin, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. It produces large, elongated fruits that can reach up to 3 meters in length, with a rough, green to yellowish skin. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, and it is valued for its edible, nutrient-rich flesh."
