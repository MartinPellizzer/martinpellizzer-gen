    "intro": "Salvia lobryana, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture, and they emit a mild, minty fragrance when crushed. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for gardens. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
