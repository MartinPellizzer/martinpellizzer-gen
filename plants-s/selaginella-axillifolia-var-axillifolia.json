    "intro": "Selaginella axillifolia var. axillifolia, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the spikemoss family (Selaginellaceae). It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a lush, mossy appearance. It produces sporangia in cone-like structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper parts of the stems. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
