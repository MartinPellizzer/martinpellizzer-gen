    "intro": "Stellaria heterophylla, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are white with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Stellaria heterophylla is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
