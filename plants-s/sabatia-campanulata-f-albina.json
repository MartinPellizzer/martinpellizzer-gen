    "intro": "Sabatia campanulata f. albina, commonly known as the white-flowered sand verbena, is a rare horticultural form of the sand verbena species. It is characterized by its pale white to nearly translucent petals, which distinguish it from the typical pink or red flowers of the species. This cultivar is typically found in sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its delicate appearance and unique coloration make it a sought-after plant among botanists and gardeners alike. The plant is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
