    "intro": "Stipa capillifolia, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control in marginal lands."
