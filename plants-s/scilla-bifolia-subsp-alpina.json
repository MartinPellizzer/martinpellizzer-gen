    "intro": "Scilla bifolia subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine scilla, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and cold tolerance, making it well adapted to high-altitude conditions. This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
