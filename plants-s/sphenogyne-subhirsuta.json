    "intro": "Sphenogyne subhirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sphenogyne, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
