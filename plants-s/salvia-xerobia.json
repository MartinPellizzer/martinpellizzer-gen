    "intro": "Salvia xerobia, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens. Salvia xerobia is also valued for its ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
