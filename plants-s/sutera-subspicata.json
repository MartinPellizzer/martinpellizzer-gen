    "intro": "Sutera subspicata, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Sutera subspicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
