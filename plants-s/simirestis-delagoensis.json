It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical research."
