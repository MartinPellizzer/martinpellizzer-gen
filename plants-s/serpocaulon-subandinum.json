    "intro": "Serpocaulon subandinum, commonly known as the Andean serpocaulon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance with slender stems and clustered, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
