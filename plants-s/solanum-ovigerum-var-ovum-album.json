    "intro": "Solanum ovigerum var. ovum-album, commonly known as the white eggplant, is a unique variant of the eggplant species characterized by its pale, almost white berries. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshade plants like tomatoes and peppers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow with a distinctive shape, and the fruits are small, round, and have a mild, slightly sweet flavor. This variety is less common than the typical purple eggplant and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes or in specific culinary contexts."
