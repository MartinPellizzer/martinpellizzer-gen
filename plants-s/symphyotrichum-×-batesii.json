    "intro": "Symphyotrichum \u00d7 batesii, commonly known as the New England aster hybrid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flower heads that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with rough textures. Its flowers are composed of ray florets and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The hybrid nature of S. \u00d7 batesii results from crosses between Symphyotrichum novae-angliae and Symphyotrichum chrysotrichum."
