    "intro": "Saxifraga sibirica var. pycnoloba, commonly known as the dense-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers appear in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
