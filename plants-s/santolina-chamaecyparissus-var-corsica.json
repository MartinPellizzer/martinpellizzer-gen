It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne in clusters atop the foliage. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly fuzzy texture, and it is highly drought-tolerant. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
