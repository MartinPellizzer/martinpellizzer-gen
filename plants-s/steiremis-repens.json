    "intro": "Steiremis repens, commonly known as the creeping steiremis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often arranged alternately along the stems. Steiremis repens typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or along stream banks."
