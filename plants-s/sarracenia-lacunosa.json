    "intro": "Sarracenia lacunosa, commonly known as the fen pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, tubular leaves that form pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's leaves are typically reddish-purple in color and have a distinctive, segmented appearance. Sarracenia lacunosa thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and requires consistent moisture. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
