    "intro": "Swida, commonly known as the common mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Swida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
