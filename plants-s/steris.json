    "intro": "Steris, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, comprises a diverse group of herbaceous plants. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets arranged in a single head. Steris species are typically found in temperate regions and often thrive in well-drained soils. They produce both ray and disk florets, contributing to their distinctive appearance. Many species within the genus are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and are also valued for their medicinal properties."
