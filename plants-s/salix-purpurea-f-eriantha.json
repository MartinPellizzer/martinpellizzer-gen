    "intro": "Salix purpurea f. eriantha, commonly known as the silky willow, is a unique horticultural form of the purple willow. It is characterized by its soft, silky hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly for its graceful, weeping habit. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a bluish-green hue. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
