    "intro": "Sphacele, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a unique plant characterized by its spherical shape and thick, fleshy stems. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. The plant has spines that help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or white, bloom in the summer months and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Sphacele is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, making it a resilient and fascinating botanical specimen."
