    "intro": "Salix amygdalina proles villarsiana, commonly known as the white willow or weeping willow, is a hybrid species within the Salicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches that hang in long, cascading streams, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, and its bark is often smooth and pale, sometimes with a faint reddish tinge. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes."
