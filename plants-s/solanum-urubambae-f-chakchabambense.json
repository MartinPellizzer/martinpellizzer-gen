    "intro": "Solanum urubambae f. chakchabambense, commonly known as the Chakchabamba nightshade, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its fruit, which is a small, yellowish berry, contains toxic alkaloids and is not suitable for human consumption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
