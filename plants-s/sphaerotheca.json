    "intro": "Sphaerotheca, commonly known as the powdery mildew fungus, is a genus of ascomycete fungi that causes plant diseases. These fungi are characterized by their ability to produce a white, powdery coating on the leaves and stems of infected plants. Sphaerotheca species are obligate parasites, meaning they require a living host to complete their life cycle. They thrive in cool, humid conditions and can affect a wide range of plants, including roses and other ornamentals. The spores of Sphaerotheca are typically dispersed by wind and can persist in the environment for extended periods."
