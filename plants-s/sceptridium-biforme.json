    "intro": "Sceptridium biforme, commonly known as the two-branched clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and tiny, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, known as strobili, which are clustered at the base of the plant. Sceptridium biforme thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
