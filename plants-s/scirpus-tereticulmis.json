It is characterized by its tall, slender, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Scirpus tereticulmis is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams where it plays a vital role in ecosystem health."
