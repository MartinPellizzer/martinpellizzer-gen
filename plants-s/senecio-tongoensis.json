    "intro": "Senecio tongoensis, commonly known as the Tongo groundsel, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Senecio tongoensis produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
