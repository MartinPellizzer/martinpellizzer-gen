    "intro": "Salicornia oliveri, commonly known as sea beans, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae, characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Salicornia oliveri plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
