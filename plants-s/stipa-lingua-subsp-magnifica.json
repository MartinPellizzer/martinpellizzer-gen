    "intro": "Stipa lingua subsp. magnifica, commonly known as the magnificent tongue grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that are highly visible during the flowering season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid environments."
