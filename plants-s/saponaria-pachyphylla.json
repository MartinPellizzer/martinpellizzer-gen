    "intro": "Saponaria pachyphylla, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and dry grasslands, thriving in full sun. Saponaria pachyphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
