    "intro": "Salix rigida var. ligulifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in riparian areas. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in open woodlands."
