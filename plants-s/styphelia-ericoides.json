    "intro": "Styphelia ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heaths, heathers, and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Styphelia ericoides is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
