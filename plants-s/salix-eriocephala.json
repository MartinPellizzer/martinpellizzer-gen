    "intro": "Salix eriocephala, commonly known as the downy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are typically male and female, with the female flowers developing into small, fuzzy capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and riverbanks. Salix eriocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
