    "intro": "Solidago parvula, commonly known as the smallflower goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting various pollinators including bees and butterflies. Solidago parvula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
