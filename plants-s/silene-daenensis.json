It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Silene daenensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
