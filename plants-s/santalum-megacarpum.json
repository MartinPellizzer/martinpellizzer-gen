    "intro": "Santalum megacarpum, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. The tree is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dark, aromatic heartwood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by yellow or reddish-brown fruits containing winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
