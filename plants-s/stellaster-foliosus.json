    "intro": "Stellaster foliosus, commonly known as the starleaf sea star, is a marine echinoderm belonging to the family Asteriidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened body and a series of short, fleshy arms that radiate from a central disc. The plant, more accurately a sea star, has a unique morphology with a central disc covered in small, rounded tubercles. Its body is typically covered in a thin layer of mucus, which helps in reducing friction during movement along the seafloor. Stellaster foliosus is often found in shallow coastal waters, where it plays a role in the benthic ecosystem by feeding on bivalves and other small invertebrates."
