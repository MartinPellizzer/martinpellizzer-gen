    "intro": "Seguiera imperfoliata, commonly known as the Mexican flame vine, is a climbing plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both versatile and somewhat invasive in certain regions."
