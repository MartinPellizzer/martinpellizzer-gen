    "intro": "Saxifraga exarata subsp. leucantha, commonly known as the white saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-velvet leaves that are adapted to cold, rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
