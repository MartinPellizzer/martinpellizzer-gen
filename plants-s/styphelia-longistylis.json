    "intro": "Styphelia longistylis, commonly known as the long-styled heath, is a flowering plant native to the wet heathlands of Tasmania. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its moist, acidic habitats. Styphelia longistylis is an important component of Tasmania's unique flora and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
