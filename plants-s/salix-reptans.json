    "intro": "Salix reptans, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its flexible, arching stems that often grow close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dull green. It thrives in moist, wet habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in riparian ecosystems."
