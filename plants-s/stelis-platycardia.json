    "intro": "Stelis platycardia, commonly known as the broad-leafed stelis, is an epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a short, often branched stem and produces clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often broader than the other petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates. Stelis platycardia is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
