    "intro": "Schiedea haakoaensis, commonly known as the Maui snowplant, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is typically found growing in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. Schiedea haakoaensis is a rare species, with limited distribution and is considered endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
