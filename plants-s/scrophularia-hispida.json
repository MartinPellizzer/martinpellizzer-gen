    "intro": "Scrophularia hispida, commonly known as rough scrophularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features erect, branched stems covered with stiff, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in whorls along the stems, and bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with toothed margins and a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
