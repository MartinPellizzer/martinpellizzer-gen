    "intro": "Selaginella sherringii, commonly known as the Sherring's spikemoss, is a rare and ancient vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. This plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky crevices or forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which produce spores for propagation. Selaginella sherringii is notable for its resilience and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary significance."
