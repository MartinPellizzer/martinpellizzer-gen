    "intro": "Solanum semidemissum, commonly known as the pale nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by berries that start green and mature to a deep red. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers, and is known for its toxic properties. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its poisonous nature."
