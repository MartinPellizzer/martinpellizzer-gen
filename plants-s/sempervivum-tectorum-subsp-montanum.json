It features compact rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces upright flowering stems topped with clusters of star-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
