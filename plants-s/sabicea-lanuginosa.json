It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The leaves are simple and alternate, often with a velvety texture, while the pods are elongated and contain several seeds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
