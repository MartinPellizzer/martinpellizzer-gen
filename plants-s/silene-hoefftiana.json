    "intro": "Silene hoefftiana, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, hairy stems and small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Silene hoefftiana is also known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators."
