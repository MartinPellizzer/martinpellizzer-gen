    "intro": "Scleranthus candolleanus subvar. ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Ruscinonese thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, often with five petals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
