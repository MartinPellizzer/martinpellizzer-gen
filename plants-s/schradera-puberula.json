    "intro": "Schradera puberula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Schradera puberula is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
