    "intro": "Scleromitrion delicatum, commonly known as the delicate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. It has small, delicate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Scleromitrion delicatum is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
