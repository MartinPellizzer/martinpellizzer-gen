    "intro": "Strychnos viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered strychnos, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. Its bark and leaves contain alkaloids, which have been traditionally used in some indigenous medicinal practices. However, the plant is toxic and should not be handled or ingested without proper knowledge."
