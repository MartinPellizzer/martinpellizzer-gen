    "intro": "Seseli dichotomum, commonly known as the forked bellflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in mountainous regions across Europe and western Asia. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps. Seseli dichotomum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported calming and antispasmodic properties."
