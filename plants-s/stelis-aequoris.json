    "intro": "Stelis aequoris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem with a few leaves and a single flower spike. Its flowers are typically white or pale green with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Stelis aequoris thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests."
