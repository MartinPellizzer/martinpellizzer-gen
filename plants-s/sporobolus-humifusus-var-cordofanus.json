    "intro": "Sporobolus humifusus var. cordofanus, commonly known as the coast alkali grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert and coastal ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and reduce erosion makes it valuable for ecological restoration projects."
