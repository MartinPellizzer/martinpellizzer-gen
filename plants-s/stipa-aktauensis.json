    "intro": "Stipa aktauensis, commonly known as the Aktau grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain minute florets surrounded by bracts. Stipa aktauensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
