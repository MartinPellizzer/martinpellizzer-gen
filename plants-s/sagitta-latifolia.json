    "intro": "Sagitta latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped at the base, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and is often used in wetland restoration projects. Sagitta latifolia is also valued for its ability to filter water and support aquatic wildlife."
