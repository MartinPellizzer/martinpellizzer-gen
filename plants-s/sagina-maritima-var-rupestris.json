    "intro": "Sagina maritima var. rupestris, commonly known as rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal and rocky habitats. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on cliffs, dunes, and rocky shores. Its succulent stems and compact growth form make it well-suited to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
