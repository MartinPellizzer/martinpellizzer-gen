    "intro": "Silene maritima var. patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its arid habitat. The species is notable for its resilience to salt spray and strong winds, making it a characteristic component of coastal vegetation."
