It typically grows in coastal and inland saline soils, thriving in regions with high salt content. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in saline habitats."
