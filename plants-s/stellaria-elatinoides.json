    "intro": "Stellaria elatinoides, commonly known as the glasswort or sea bean, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other moist, saline habitats. Its seeds are encased in a tough, leathery coat, which aids in their dispersal and survival in harsh conditions. Stellaria elatinoides plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
