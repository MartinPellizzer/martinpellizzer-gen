    "intro": "Schizopremna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and small, alternate leaves that are often narrow and lance-shaped. The flowers are typically unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. Schizopremna species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are valued for their hard, durable wood and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
