    "intro": "Senecio ambrosioides var. indivisus, commonly known as the Indian blanket or gaillardia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that typically range in color from orange to red. The plant features a branching stem covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance.
