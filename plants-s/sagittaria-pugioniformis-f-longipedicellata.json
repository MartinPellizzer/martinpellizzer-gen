    "intro": "Sagittaria pugioniformis f. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-beaked arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and distinctive floral structures. This aquatic or semi-aquatic plant is native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in spikes, with the inflorescence bearing elongated pedicels, giving it the 'longipedicellata' descriptor. The plant thrives in shallow water and is often found in regions with muddy or sandy substrates. It plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
