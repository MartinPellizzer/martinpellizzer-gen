    "intro": "Stellilabium vasquezii, commonly known as the star-labium lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped petals that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Stellilabium vasquezii is considered a species of conservation concern."
