    "intro": "Stechmannia gabrieliae, commonly known as Gabriel's stechmannia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, forming a rosette that helps collect moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
