    "intro": "Salix schnelleriana, commonly known as the Schneller's willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Salicaceae family."
