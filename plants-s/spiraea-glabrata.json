    "intro": "Spiraea glabrata, commonly known as smooth spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features multiple stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are smooth and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Spiraea glabrata is also valued for its adaptability and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
