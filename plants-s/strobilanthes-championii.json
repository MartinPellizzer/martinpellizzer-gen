    "intro": "Strobilanthes championii, commonly known as the \"Singapore flame\" or \"fire plant,\" is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-orange bracts that resemble flames, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the monsoon season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
