    "intro": "Schiedeella velata, commonly known as the velvet schiedea, is a rare and unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, and often fuzzy leaves that give it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Schiedeella velata is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
