    "intro": "Sedum saxifragoides, commonly known as stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils, often in sunny environments. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Sedum saxifragoides is popular in rock gardens and as a low-maintenance ornamental plant."
