It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its clustered, club-shaped fruiting bodies that resemble tiny cabbages. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The botanical features of Sphaerocoryne clavipes make it an interesting subject for study in mycology and plant morphology."
