    "intro": "Smilax rufa, commonly known as the red-stemmed catbrier, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Smilax rufa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its ability to climb and spread through its thorny stems. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stability."
