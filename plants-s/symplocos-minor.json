    "intro": "Symplocos minor, commonly known as the small wax myrtle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is characterized by its small, glossy, oval leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. Symplocos minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife. It is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
