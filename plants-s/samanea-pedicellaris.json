    "intro": "Samanea pedicellaris, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. The tree is known for its hard, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
