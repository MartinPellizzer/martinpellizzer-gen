    "intro": "Salix bigelovii, commonly known as the Bigelow willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are important for pollination by wind. It thrives in moist environments such as streambanks and wetlands, making it an important species for riparian ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
