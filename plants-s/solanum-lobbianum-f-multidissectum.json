    "intro": "Solanum lobbianum f. multidissectum, commonly known as the multidissected nightshade, is a botanical variant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its highly dissected, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that typically transition into berries, which can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
