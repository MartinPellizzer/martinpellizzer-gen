    "intro": "Scirpus pedicellatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense stands that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. The plant has tall, slender stems that are often branched and bear small, clustered spikes of greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and they are adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions. Scirpus pedicellatus plays an important role in wetland habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
