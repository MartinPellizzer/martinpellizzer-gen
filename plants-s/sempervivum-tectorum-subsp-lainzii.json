    "intro": "Sempervivum tectorum subsp. lainzii, commonly known as the Lanz Island houseleek, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It prefers full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. This subspecies is noted for its hardiness and ability to survive in harsh environments."
