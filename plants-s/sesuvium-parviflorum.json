    "intro": "Sesuvium parviflorum, commonly known as shore morning glory, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in tidal zones and rocky shores. The plant has fleshy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in the morning. Sesuvium parviflorum is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate both sun and partial shade."
