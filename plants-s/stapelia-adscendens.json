    "intro": "Stapelia adscendens, commonly known as the ascending star cactus, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a branching stem system with cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow upwards to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Stapelia adscendens is often cultivated for its striking appearance and resilience."
