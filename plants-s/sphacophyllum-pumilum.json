    "intro": "Sphacophyllum pumilum, commonly known as the small sphacophyllum, is a small, crustose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Sphaerophyceae and is characterized by its dense, greenish to yellowish thallus. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is typically found on rocks, tree bark, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Its simple morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
