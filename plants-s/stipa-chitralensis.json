    "intro": "Stipa chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in cold, mountainous environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in harsh conditions, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat. Stipa chitralensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
