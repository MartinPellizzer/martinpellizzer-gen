    "intro": "Sorbus aria subsp. graeca, commonly known as the Greek whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal interest."
