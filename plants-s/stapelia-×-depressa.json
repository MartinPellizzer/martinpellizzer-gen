It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive scent reminiscent of decaying flesh. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. Stapelia \u00d7 depressa is a popular choice for succulent gardens due to its resilience and unique appearance."
