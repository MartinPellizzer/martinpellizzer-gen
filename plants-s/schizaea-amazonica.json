It belongs to the family Schizaeaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, segmented rhizomes and fern-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in specialized leaf structures called sorus. Schizaea amazonica plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
