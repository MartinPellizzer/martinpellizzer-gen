    "intro": "Schizachyrium glabrescens, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in prairie and woodland environments. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades that turn coppery in the fall, and its slender, branched seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and well adapted to full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species. Schizachyrium glabrescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in restoration projects."
