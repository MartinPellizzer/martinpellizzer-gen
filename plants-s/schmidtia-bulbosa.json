    "intro": "Schmidtia bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous schmidtia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive bulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapting to its harsh environment. Schmidtia bulbosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
