    "intro": "Silene setacea var. microsperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact flowers compared to the typical form of Silene setacea."
