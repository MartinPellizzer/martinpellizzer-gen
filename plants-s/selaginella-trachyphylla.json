    "intro": "Selaginella trachyphylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved spikemoss, is a vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features spirally arranged, linear leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Selaginella trachyphylla produces strobila (spore cones) that are clustered at the tips of its stems, a characteristic feature of many spore-bearing plants. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in arid conditions."
