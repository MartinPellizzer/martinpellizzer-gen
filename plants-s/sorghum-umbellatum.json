    "intro": "Sorghum umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella sorghum, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, umbrella-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically arranged in a panicle structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Sorghum umbellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its decorative foliage and unique floral display."
