It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures called sporangia, which contain the spores for reproduction. Its leaves are typically short and clustered, forming a dense, compact growth pattern. This fern is often found in moist, shaded environments, thriving in humid tropical climates."
