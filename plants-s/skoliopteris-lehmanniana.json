    "intro": "Skoliopteris lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's skoliopteris, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Sphenophyta. It was a large, tree-like fern that thrived during the Carboniferous period. The plant had a distinctive, segmented trunk and large, feather-like fronds. Its structure suggests it played a significant role in the early development of forest ecosystems. Fossil records of Skoliopteris lehmanniana provide valuable insights into ancient plant life and evolutionary adaptations."
