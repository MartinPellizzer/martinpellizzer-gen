    "intro": "Sinomerrillia bracteata, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
