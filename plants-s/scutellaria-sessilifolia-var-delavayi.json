    "intro": "Scutellaria sessilifolia var. delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's skullcap, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and opposite leaves. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in whorled clusters. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are often lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
