    "intro": "Syzygium pustulatum, commonly known as the rough-leaf tamarind, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a tangy, sour flavor, similar to tamarind. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye."
