    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. limbata, commonly known as the yellow trumpet pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange-red pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes, where it can absorb nutrients from its surroundings. Its flowers are typically pink or red, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety *limbata* is distinguished by its broader, more robust pitchers compared to the typical *flava* form."
