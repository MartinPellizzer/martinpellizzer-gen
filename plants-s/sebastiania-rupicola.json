    "intro": "Sebastiania rupicola, commonly known as the rock sebastiania, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, often spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
