It is characterized by its slender, tall form and scale-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in coastal and arid environments."
