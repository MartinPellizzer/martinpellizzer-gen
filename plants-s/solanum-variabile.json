    "intro": "Solanum variabile, commonly known as the variable nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its variable morphology, which can lead to confusion with other species. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual or perennial, with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five petals, and it produces small, spherical berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its variability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
