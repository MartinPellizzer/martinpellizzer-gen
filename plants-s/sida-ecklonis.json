    "intro": "Sida ecklonis, commonly known as the blueweed or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in sandy or saline soils. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sida ecklonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
