    "intro": "Sesleria insularis subsp. sillingeri, commonly known as the coastal sesleria, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to the western Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
