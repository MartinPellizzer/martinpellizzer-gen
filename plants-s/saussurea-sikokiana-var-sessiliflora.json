    "intro": "Saussurea sikokiana var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the Himalayan snow lotus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and striking, pale yellow to white composite flower heads. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
