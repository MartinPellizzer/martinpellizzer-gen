It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
