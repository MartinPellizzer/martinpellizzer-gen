    "intro": "Solidago rigida var. microcephala, commonly known as stiff goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish-green to gold-colored flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry meadows and open woodlands. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flower heads compared to other solidago species."
