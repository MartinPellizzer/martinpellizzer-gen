    "intro": "Salix alba var. glaucescens, commonly known as the white willow with a bluish tinge, is a variant of the white willow native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, oval leaves that often have a bluish or silvery hue on the underside. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is typically found in moist, often riparian habitats. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters in height. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
