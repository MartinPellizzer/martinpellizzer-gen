    "intro": "Senecio boscianus, commonly known as the Boscianus groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Senecio boscianus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
