    "intro": "Sinarundinaria forrestii, commonly known as the Chinese cliffbrake, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in mountainous regions. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Sinarundinaria forrestii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
