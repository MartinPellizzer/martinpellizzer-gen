    "intro": "Solanum andigenum var. longibaccatum, commonly known as the Andean nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces elongated, fleshy berries that range in color from yellow to red, containing numerous seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which includes other economically important plants like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its toxic compounds, it is not typically cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
