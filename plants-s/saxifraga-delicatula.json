    "intro": "Saxifraga delicatula, commonly known as the delicate saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, often white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are usually succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Saxifraga delicatula plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous and tundra habitats."
