    "intro": "Stenandrium fosbergii, commonly known as the Fosberg's stenandrium, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its vivid, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to orange, with prominent red stamens that add to its visual appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
