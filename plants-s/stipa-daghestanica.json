    "intro": "Stipa daghestanica, commonly known as the Daghestan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering spikes are usually slender and spike-like, bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Stipa daghestanica plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
