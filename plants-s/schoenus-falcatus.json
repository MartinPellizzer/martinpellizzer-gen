    "intro": "Schoenus falcatus, commonly known as the zigzag sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along water bodies. Its leaves are often curved or zigzagged, giving it its common name. Schoenus falcatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
