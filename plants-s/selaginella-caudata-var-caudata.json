    "intro": "Selaginella caudata var. caudata, commonly known as the forked moss plant, is a species of spore-bearing fern belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems that often form dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. This plant is often found in arid or semi-arid regions and is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
