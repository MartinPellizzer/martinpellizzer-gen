    "intro": "Silene subspathulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf catchfly, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Silene subspathulata is an important component of alpine ecosystems and is often found in mountainous regions across the northern hemisphere."
