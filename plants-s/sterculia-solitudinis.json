    "intro": "Sterculia solitudinis, commonly known as the Solitary Sterculia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to remote, high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, often with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and moths. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sterculia solitudinis is considered a highly endangered species."
