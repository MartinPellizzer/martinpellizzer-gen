    "intro": "Stellilabium morii, commonly known as the star-labium orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant blossoms that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate labellum patterns. Stellilabium morii thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
