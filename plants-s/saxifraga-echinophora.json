    "intro": "Saxifraga echinophora, commonly known as the prickly saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and are clustered in a dense inflorescence at the center of the plant. Saxifraga echinophora is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high elevations where it plays a role in stabilizing rocky substrates."
