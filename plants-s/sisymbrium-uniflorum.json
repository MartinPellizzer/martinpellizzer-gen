    "intro": "Sisymbrium uniflorum, commonly known as the one-flower broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a root system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a challenge for agricultural crops."
