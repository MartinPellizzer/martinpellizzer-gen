    "intro": "Salix aurora, commonly known as the dawn willow, is a species of willow native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that gives it a striking appearance in the morning light. Salix aurora is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
