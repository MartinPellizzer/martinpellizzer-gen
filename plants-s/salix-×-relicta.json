    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 relicta, commonly known as the weeping willow hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is a natural hybrid between Salix matsudana and Salix babylonica, characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that give it a graceful appearance. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small catkins in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted near water features for its ornamental value. However, it can be invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
