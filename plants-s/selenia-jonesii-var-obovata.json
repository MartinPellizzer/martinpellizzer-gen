It is characterized by its obovate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the winter months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
