    "intro": "Sinclairia tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzii fern, is a rare and delicate member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sinclairia tonduzii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
