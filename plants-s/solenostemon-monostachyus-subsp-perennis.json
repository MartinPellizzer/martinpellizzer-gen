    "intro": "Solenostemon monostachyus subsp. perennis, commonly known as the evergreen spurge, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers, typically blooming in spring or early summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
