    "intro": "Stillingia querceticola, commonly known as the oak-leafed stillingia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, hence its common name. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to orange, with a structure typical of the Papaveraceae family, featuring a superior ovary and a capsule fruit. Stillingia querceticola is often found in moist, wooded areas and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
