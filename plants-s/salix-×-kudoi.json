    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 kudoi, commonly known as the Japanese weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches that create a graceful, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
