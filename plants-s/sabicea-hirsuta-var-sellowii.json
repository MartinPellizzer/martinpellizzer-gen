    "intro": "Sabicea hirsuta var. sellowii, commonly known as the Sellow's hairy sabicea, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. This species is often found in humid, tropical environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
