    "intro": "Sorbus multicrenata, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are typically oval with rounded teeth, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. Sorbus multicrenata is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive form and seasonal interest."
