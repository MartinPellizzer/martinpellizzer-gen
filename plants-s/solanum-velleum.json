    "intro": "Solanum velleum, commonly known as the velvet nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Solanum velleum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption and handled with care."
