    "intro": "Sutera asbestina, commonly known as the asbestos leaf or false mignonette, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Sutera asbestina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or borders. Its common name is derived from the appearance of its leaves, which resemble asbestos fibers."
