    "intro": "Stelis prolata, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, slender stems that often hang from trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the rainy season. Stelis prolata has linear, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
