    "intro": "Saponaria ocymoides var. alsinoides, commonly known as the Alsike campion, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems with clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its common name derives from its resemblance to the plant alsike, and it is often used in wildflower meadows and as a border plant."
