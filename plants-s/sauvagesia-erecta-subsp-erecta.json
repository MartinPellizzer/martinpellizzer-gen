    "intro": "Sauvagesia erecta subsp. erecta, commonly known as the upright sauvagesia, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has grey-green leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds. This species is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas where it tolerates salt spray."
