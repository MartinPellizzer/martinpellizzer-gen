    "intro": "Syrmatium procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate syrmatium, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically features wiry, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Syrmatium procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks."
