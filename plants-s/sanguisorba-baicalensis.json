    "intro": "Sanguisorba baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal sorrel, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. Sanguisorba baicalensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
