    "intro": "Salsola pilosa, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and saline soils. The plant has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, smooth, edible fruits. Salsola pilosa is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
