    "intro": "Schefflera monticola var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by yellowish berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and indirect sunlight. This variant is prized for its compact growth habit and striking leaf coloration, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
