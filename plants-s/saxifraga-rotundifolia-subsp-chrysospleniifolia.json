    "intro": "Saxifraga rotundifolia subsp. chrysospleniifolia, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
