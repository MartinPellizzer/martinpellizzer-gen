    "intro": "Schilleria indecora, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often mistaken for those of the true hellebore. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries. Schilleria indecora is typically found in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soils. It is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures."
