    "intro": "Spergularia media proles nobreana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically borne on short, erect stems and are pollinated by wind or insects. Spergularia media proles nobreana is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines."
