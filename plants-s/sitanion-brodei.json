    "intro": "Sitanion brodei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Sitanion brodei plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not commonly cultivated."
