    "intro": "Schizostachyum brachycladum var. auriculatum, commonly known as the golden ear bamboo, is a variant of the brachycladum species within the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-colored auriculate (ear-like) leaf bases, which give it its common name. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, tropical environments. Its tall, slender culms can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. This bamboo is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional crafts and construction in its native regions."
