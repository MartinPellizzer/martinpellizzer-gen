    "intro": "Stillingia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock-stemmed stillingia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems that are often covered in a thick layer of resinous exudate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by narrow, elliptical leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a plant of conservation concern."
