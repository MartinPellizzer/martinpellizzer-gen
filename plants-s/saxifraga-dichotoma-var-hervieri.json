    "intro": "Saxifraga dichotoma var. hervieri, commonly known as the Hervier's saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in mountainous environments. The plant features a low-growing, cushion-like form with dark green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and appear in clusters, blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
