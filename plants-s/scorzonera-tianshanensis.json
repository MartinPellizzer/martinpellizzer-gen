    "intro": "Scorzonera tianshanensis, commonly known as the Tianshan scorzonera, is a perennial herb native to the Tianshan mountain range in Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow ray florets. The plant produces a taproot that is often tuberous, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Scorzonera. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its mountainous habitat. Scorzonera tianshanensis is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
