    "intro": "Stellaria australis, commonly known as the Australian starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features small, white or pale blue star-shaped flowers that bloom from spring to autumn. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Stellaria australis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded environments."
