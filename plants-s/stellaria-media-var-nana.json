    "intro": "Stellaria media var. nana, commonly known as dwarf chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate white flowers with five petals arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its scientific name. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in gardens and along pathways. Due to its compact size and attractive appearance, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
