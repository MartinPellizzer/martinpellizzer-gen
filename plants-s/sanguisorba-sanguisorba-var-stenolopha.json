    "intro": "Sanguisorba sanguisorba var. stenolopha, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces dense clusters of small, reddish-pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
