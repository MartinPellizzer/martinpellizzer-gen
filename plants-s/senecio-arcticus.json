    "intro": "Senecio arcticus, commonly known as Arctic groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Senecio arcticus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
