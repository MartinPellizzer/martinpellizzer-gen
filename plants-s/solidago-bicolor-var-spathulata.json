    "intro": "Solidago bicolor var. spathulata, commonly known as the spoonleaf goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of yellow-orange flower heads, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lanceolate to spoon-shaped, with a distinctive basal rosette and a rough texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting native pollinators."
