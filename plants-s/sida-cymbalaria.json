    "intro": "Sida cymbalaria, commonly known as common sida, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, hairy leaves that are often opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains several seeds. Sida cymbalaria is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
