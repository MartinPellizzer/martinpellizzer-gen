    "intro": "Selaginella peltata, commonly known as the basket fern or lacy spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. Selaginella peltata reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
