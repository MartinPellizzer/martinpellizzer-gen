    "intro": "Saxifraga punctata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of dark green, velvety leaves that are often adorned with white or silver markings. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its hardy nature and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
