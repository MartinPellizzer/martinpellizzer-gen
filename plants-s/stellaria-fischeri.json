    "intro": "Stellaria fischeri, commonly known as Fischer's starwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to the northern regions of North America. It typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in wet meadows, stream banks, and roadside ditches. The plant features a prostrate or ascending stem with small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Stellaria fischeri is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments, where it can spread via seeds dispersed by wind or water."
