    "intro": "Salaciopsis megaphylla f. attenuata, commonly known as the slender-leafed salaciopsis, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, attenuated fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with a creeping rhizome and dichotomous branching, typical of many ferns. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, leathery texture and a pale green hue. This fern thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in primary forest understories."
