It features elegant, arching fronds with a distinctive, leathery texture and a deep green color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
