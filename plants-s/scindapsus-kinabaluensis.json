    "intro": "Scindapsus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu nettle, is a rare species native to the high altitudes of Borneo. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, heart-shaped leaves with a netted venation pattern. The plant is evergreen and typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, clinging to tree trunks or rock surfaces. Its foliage is often a deep green with a slight variegation, making it a striking ornamental plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is rarely found in cultivation."
