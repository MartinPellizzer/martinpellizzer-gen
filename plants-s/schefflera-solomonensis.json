    "intro": "Schefflera solomonensis, commonly known as Solomon Islands umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters, with a spreading habit that makes it suitable for ornamental purposes. Its foliage provides a lush, full appearance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping. Schefflera solomonensis prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, and it is relatively low maintenance once established."
