    "intro": "Selaginella albidula var. macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-stalked spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to arid regions of North America. It features creeping rhizomes with dense, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces compact, spike-like clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves and more robust strobila compared to other Selaginella species."
