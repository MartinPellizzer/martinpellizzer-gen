    "intro": "Saxifraga stellaris subsp. comosa, commonly known as the star saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
