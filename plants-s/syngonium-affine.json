    "intro": "Syngonium affine, commonly known as arrowhead vine, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that often have a distinctive arrowhead pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant is a climbing shrub that thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light. Its foliage is typically a vibrant green, and it can produce small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries. Syngonium affine is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
