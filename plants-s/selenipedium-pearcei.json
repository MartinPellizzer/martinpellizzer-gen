    "intro": "Selenipedium pearcei, commonly known as the Mexican hooded orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is native to the cloud forests of Mexico and is characterized by its long, arching stems and large, hooded flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to thrive. Its botanical features include thick, fleshy leaves and a unique floral structure that resembles a hood. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
