    "intro": "Spartina platensis, commonly known as salt marsh cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It thrives in brackish and saline wetlands, playing a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. The plant has hollow, cylindrical stems and blade-like leaves, which help it withstand tidal forces and saltwater exposure. It is also an important component of salt marsh ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and bird species. Spartina platensis reproduces through both seeds and rhizomes, allowing it to spread and form dense stands in its coastal environment."
