    "intro": "Schoepfia calva, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features woody stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its showy, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
