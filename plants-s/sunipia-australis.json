It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Sunipia australis is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
