    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 geifolia, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of dark green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga \u00d7 geifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to colonize difficult, rocky habitats."
