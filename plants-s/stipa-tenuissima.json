    "intro": "Stipa tenuissima, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds make it an important component of ecosystems in arid and semi-arid environments. Stipa tenuissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
