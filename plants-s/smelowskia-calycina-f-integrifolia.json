    "intro": "Smelowskia calycina f. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed smelowskia, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, entire leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its habitat is limited to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its restricted distribution and delicate growth requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
