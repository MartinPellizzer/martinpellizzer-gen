    "intro": "Senegalia micrantha, commonly known as screwbean mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its twisted, often gnarled branches and small, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Senegalia micrantha is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it an important species for soil stabilization and livestock forage."
