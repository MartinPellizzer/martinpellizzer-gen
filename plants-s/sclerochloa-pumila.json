    "intro": "Sclerochloa pumila, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Sclerochloa pumila is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its compact growth form makes it an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and soil stabilization."
