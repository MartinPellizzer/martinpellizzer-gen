    "intro": "Scirpus exiguus, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Scirpus exiguus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
