    "intro": "Symphyotrichum \u00d7 columbianum, commonly known as the New England aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flower heads that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has lance-shaped leaves with rough textures and produces numerous ray flowers surrounding a central disk. Symphyotrichum \u00d7 columbianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide food for pollinators."
