It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine pubescence. Scleranthus pityophilus is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
