    "intro": "Samolus, commonly known as the water pepper or marsh woundwort, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Onagraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have small, lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers. They often thrive in wet or marshy environments, which is reflected in their common names. Samolus species are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
