    "intro": "Schefflera troyana, commonly known as the Troyana umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like clusters of large, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark blue berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera troyana is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
