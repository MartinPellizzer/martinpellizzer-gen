    "intro": "Stigmatopteris prionites var. pseudocaudata, commonly known as the false-tailed water fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both conservationists and paleobotanists due to its evolutionary significance."
