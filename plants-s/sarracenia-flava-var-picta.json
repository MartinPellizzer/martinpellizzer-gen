    "intro": "Sarracenia flava var. picta, commonly known as the yellow pitcherplant, is a striking carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a red-veined, hooded structure that helps funnel prey into the hollow leaf blade. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This variant is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and ecological role in nutrient-poor environments."
