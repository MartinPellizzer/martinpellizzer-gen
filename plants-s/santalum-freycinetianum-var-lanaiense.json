    "intro": "Santalum freycinetianum var. lanaiense, commonly known as the Lanai sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is a member of the Santalaceae family and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its unique scent. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its roots. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
