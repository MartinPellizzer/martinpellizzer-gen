    "intro": "Silene tetonensis, commonly known as the Teton mountain catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Silene tetonensis has small, alternate leaves and produces seeds in a capsule-like structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
