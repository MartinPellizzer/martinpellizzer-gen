    "intro": "Sclerobasis, commonly known as the \"sclerobasis\" or a type of plant structure, refers to a hard, woody base found in certain plants. It is typically a thickened, fibrous layer that supports the plant's stem or root system. This structure is often composed of sclerenchyma cells, which are specialized for strength and rigidity. The sclerobasis plays a crucial role in providing mechanical support and protecting the plant from environmental stress. Its presence is a key botanical feature in various plant families, particularly in those with robust growth habits."
