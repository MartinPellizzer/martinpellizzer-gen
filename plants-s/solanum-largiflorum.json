    "intro": "Solanum largiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, tomatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, toxic berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires caution when handling."
