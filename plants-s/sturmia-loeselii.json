    "intro": "Sturmia loeselii, commonly known as the Loesel's sturmia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, erect stem and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. Sturmia loeselii thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
