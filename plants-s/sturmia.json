It consists of several species, including Sturmia lycioides, which is native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. These plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their compound leaves and yellow or white flowers. The fruits are legumes, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals. Sturmia species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their deep root systems."
