    "intro": "Sapindus ruber, commonly known as the red soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and compound leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its fruit contains a toxic, soapy substance that has been historically used for cleaning purposes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
