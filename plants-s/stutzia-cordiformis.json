    "intro": "Stutzia cordiformis, commonly known as the heart-shaped sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its succulent foliage. Stutzia cordiformis is well adapted to saline and arid environments, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it a notable example of coastal flora."
