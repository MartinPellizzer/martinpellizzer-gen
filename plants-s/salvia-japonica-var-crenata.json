    "intro": "Salvia japonica var. crenata, commonly known as Japanese sage or velvetleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to Japan. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, slightly wavy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
