    "intro": "Solenocentrum lueri, commonly known as the Luer's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout trunk and dense, feathery foliage. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones developing on separate plants. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
