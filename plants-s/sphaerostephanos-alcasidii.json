    "intro": "Sphaerostephanos alcasidii, commonly known as the Alcacid's globe-stephanos, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Sphaerostephanos alcasidii is considered a vulnerable species."
