    "intro": "Santalina, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Santalaceae. It is characterized by its woody, evergreen shrubs or trees, often with small, fragrant flowers. The plant is hemi-parasitic, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. Santalina species are native to various regions, including Australia, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. The wood of certain species is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in perfumes, incense, and traditional medicine."
