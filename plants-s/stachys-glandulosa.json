    "intro": "Stachys glandulosa, commonly known as sticky betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Stachys glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
