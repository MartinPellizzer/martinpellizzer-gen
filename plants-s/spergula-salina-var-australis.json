    "intro": "Spergula salina var. australis, commonly known as the Australian saltgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is native to coastal regions of southern Australia and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils with high salt content. The plant typically forms low, sprawling mats with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or water. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
