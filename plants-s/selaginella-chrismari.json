    "intro": "Selaginella chrismari, commonly known as the Christmas clubmoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, scale-like leaves that form tight, compact clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are cone-like and contain spores, which are released during the dry season. Selaginella chrismari is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
