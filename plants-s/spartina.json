    "intro": "Spartina, commonly known as cordgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fibrous growth habit, often found in coastal and brackish wetlands. Spartina species are highly adaptable, thriving in saline and tidal environments due to their specialized root systems and salt-excreting leaves. They play a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. Additionally, some species have been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive and altering local ecosystems."
