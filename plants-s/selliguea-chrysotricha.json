    "intro": "Selliguea chrysotricha, commonly known as the golden-haired liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features small, spirally arranged leaves that are often covered with a layer of fine, golden hairs, giving it its common name. Selliguea chrysotricha is a cryptogamic plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Its structure and appearance make it an important component of the microhabitats in temperate and tropical regions."
