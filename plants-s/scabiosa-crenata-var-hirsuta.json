    "intro": "Scabiosa crenata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the fuzzy scabious, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is also noted for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
