    "intro": "Solanum verae-crucis, commonly known as the Cross of Christ tomato, is a species of nightshade plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, red, cherry-like fruits that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a culinary crop due to its sweet, tangy flavor. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
