    "intro": "Stellaria moenchii, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, star-shaped white flowers and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense mats in suitable habitats. Stellaria moenchii is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
