    "intro": "Saussurea robusta, commonly known as the Tibetan giant yellowflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, robust stem and large, yellowish-white composite flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with its fibrous root system. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Saussurea robusta is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
