    "intro": "Solanum acuminatissimum, commonly known as the slender nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia, and typically grows in tropical rainforests. The plant features small, egg-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its berries are small, red when mature, and contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species within its native range."
