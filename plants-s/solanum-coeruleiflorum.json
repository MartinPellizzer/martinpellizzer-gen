    "intro": "Solanum coeruleiflorum, commonly known as the blueflower nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish fruits that are toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
