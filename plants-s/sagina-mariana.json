    "intro": "Sagina mariana, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features small, densely packed leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in natural habitats."
