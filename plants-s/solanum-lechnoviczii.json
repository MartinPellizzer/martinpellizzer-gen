    "intro": "Solanum lechnoviczii, commonly known as the Lechnovicz's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, featuring simple, alternate leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. Its fruit is a fleshy berry that contains several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the nightshade family."
