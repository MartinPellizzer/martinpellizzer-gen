    "intro": "Salvia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with soft, gray-green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of violet to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies for their aromatic and medicinal properties. Salvia latifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
