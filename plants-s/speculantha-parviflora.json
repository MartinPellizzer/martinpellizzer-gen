    "intro": "Speculantha parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered speculantha, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
