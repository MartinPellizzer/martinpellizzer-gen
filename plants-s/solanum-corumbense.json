    "intro": "Solanum corumbense, commonly known as the Corumbense nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine layer of hair, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is not suitable for human consumption but is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
