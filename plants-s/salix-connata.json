    "intro": "Salix connata, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often found along stream banks and moist soils. It has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to wet environments. Salix connata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
