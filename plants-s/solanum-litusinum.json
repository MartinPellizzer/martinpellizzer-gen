    "intro": "Solanum litusinum, commonly known as the coastal nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, containing several seeds. Solanum litusinum is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
