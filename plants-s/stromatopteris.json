    "intro": "Stromatopteris, commonly known as the \"liverwort,\" is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the order Marchantiales. These plants are typically small, mat-forming, and thrive in moist, shaded environments. Stromatopteris species are characterized by their flat, ribbon-like leaves and lack of true roots, stems, or leaves in the traditional sense. They play an important role in early succession ecosystems and are often found in tropical and temperate regions. Their simple structure and ancient lineage make them valuable for studying the evolution of land plants."
