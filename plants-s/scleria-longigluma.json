    "intro": "Scleria longigluma, commonly known as the long-leaved bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, followed by three-lobed, boat-shaped seeds. Scleria longigluma thrives in marshy areas and is often found along riverbanks and in shallow water. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
