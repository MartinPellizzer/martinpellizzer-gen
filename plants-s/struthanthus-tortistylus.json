    "intro": "Struthanthus tortistylus, commonly known as the twisted-stemmed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, twisted stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
