    "intro": "Silene vaccaria, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming habit with fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its scientific name reflects its historical use in herbal medicine for its purported healing properties. Silene vaccaria is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
