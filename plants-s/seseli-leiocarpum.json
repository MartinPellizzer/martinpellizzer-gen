It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its compound umbels of small white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Seseli leiocarpum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
