    "intro": "Stellaria multiflora subsp. nebulosa, commonly known as nebulous starwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance."
