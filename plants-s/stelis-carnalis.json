    "intro": "Stelis carnalis, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is an epiphytic orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its rhizome is short and produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat."
