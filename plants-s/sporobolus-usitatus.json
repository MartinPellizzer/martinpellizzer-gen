    "intro": "Sporobolus usitatus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and coastal dunes. Its leaves are narrow and rolled, reducing water loss in arid environments. Sporobolus usitatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
