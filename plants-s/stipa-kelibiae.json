The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy component of desert ecosystems. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, while its seeds are small and wind-dispersed. Stipa kelibiae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
