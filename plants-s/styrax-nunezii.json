    "intro": "Styrax nunezii, commonly known as the Florida ash or N\u00fa\u00f1ez styrax, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it often has a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. Styrax nunezii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage and floral display."
