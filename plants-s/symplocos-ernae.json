It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, edible berries that turn red in autumn. Symplocos ernae thrives in acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountain slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts."
