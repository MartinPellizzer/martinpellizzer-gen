    "intro": "Stenotus borealis, commonly known as the northern stenotus, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Stenotus borealis plays a role in the pollination process by attracting specific insect pollinators in its environment."
