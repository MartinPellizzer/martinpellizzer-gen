    "intro": "Salix lasiandra var. fendleriana, commonly known as the Fendler's willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves with a rough, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found along riverbanks and in rocky soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
