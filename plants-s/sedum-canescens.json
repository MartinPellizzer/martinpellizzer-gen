    "intro": "Sedum canescens, commonly known as the gray stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry climates."
