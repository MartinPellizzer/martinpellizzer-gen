    "intro": "Spiradiclis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan spiradiclis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Spiradiclis hainanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
