    "intro": "Siloxerus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit, typically found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants produce showy, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Siloxerus species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, often relying on symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an important component of their native ecosystems."
