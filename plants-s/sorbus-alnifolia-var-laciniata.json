    "intro": "Sorbus alnifolia var. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its finely toothed, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the autumn. It thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often used in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
