    "intro": "Sedum aizoon var. ramosum, commonly known as the coral beauty, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features fleshy, greenish-blue leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and vibrant color make it a popular choice for both ornamental and drought-tolerant landscaping."
