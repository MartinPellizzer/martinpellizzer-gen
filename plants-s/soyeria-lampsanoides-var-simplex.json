    "intro": "Soyeria lampsanoides var. simplex, commonly known as the simple soyeria, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a mild, spicy scent. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
