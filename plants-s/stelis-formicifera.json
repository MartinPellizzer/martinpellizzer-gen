    "intro": "Stelis formicifera, commonly known as the ant-mimic orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble ants, a feature that likely serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive elongated shape. Stelis formicifera is often cultivated for its unique appearance and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
