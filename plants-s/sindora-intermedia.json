    "intro": "Sindora intermedia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
