    "intro": "Stapelia caespitosa var. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy stapelia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, ribbed stems that are covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for succulent collectors."
