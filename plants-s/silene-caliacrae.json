    "intro": "Silene caliacrae, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that open in the evening. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions through its deep root system and ability to conserve water. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and other nocturnal insects. Silene caliacrae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for desert pollinators."
