    "intro": "Stemonurus viridis, commonly known as the green stemless grass, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention. Stemonurus viridis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
