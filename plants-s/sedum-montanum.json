    "intro": "Sedum montanum, commonly known as the mountain stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to red. The plant has thick, water-storing leaves that help it survive in arid and rocky environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Sedum montanum is also known for its ability to propagate easily through stem cuttings."
