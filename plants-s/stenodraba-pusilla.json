    "intro": "Stenodraba pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and rosette-forming leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Stenodraba pusilla thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
