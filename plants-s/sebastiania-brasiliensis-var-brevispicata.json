    "intro": "Sebastiania brasiliensis var. brevispicata, commonly known as the short-spurred sebastiania, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
