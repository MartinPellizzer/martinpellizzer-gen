    "intro": "Solidago uliginosa var. jejunifolia, commonly known as the slender swamp goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and wet meadows. Its slender stems and reduced foliage distinguish it from other goldenrod species. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
