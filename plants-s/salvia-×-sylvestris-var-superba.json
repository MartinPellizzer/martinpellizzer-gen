    "intro": "Salvia \u00d7 sylvestris var. superba, commonly known as the purple giant sage, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and produces showy, violet-blue flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
