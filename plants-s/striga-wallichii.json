    "intro": "Striga wallichii, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Asia, including India, China, and Nepal. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. Its parasitic nature makes it a significant agricultural pest, particularly in crops like wheat and barley."
