    "intro": "Schoenus caespitans, commonly known as the tufted bulrush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It forms dense, clump-like growths with slender, cylindrical stems that often have a fibrous, spongy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in marshy areas, making it ecologically significant. Schoenus caespitans is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
