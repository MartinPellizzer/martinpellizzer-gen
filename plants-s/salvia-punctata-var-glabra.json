It features slender, upright stems that are covered in soft, gray-green foliage. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
