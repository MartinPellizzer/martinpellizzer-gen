    "intro": "Salix cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's willow, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its leaves turn yellow in the fall, contributing to the seasonal color changes in its natural habitat. Salix cusickii is often found in moist environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows."
