    "intro": "Schoenoxiphium caricoides var. major, commonly known as the large marsh thistle, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, often covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a rough texture, adapted to thrive in moist environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
