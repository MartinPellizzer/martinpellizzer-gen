    "intro": "Saccoloma squamosum, commonly known as the scaly saccoloma, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, scaly fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome with numerous roots, and its fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium. Saccoloma squamosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
