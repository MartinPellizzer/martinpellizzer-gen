    "intro": "Sempervivum violascens, commonly known as the violet stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with purple or violet, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or violet during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Sempervivum violascens is also known for its ability to survive in harsh climates, including cold winters and rocky soils."
