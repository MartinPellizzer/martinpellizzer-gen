    "intro": "Scirpus verrucifer, commonly known as the warty bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of greenish or brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Scirpus verrucifer plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
