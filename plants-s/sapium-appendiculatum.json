    "intro": "Sapium appendiculatum, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter beneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules that split open to release seeds. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
