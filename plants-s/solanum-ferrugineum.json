    "intro": "Solanum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
