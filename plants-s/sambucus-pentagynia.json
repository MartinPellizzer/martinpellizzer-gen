    "intro": "Sambucus pentagynia, commonly known as the five-petaled elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and typically have five leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic seeds that should be avoided. Sambucus pentagynia is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental value in gardens."
