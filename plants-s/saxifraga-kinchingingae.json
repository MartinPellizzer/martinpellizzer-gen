    "intro": "Saxifraga kinchingingae, commonly known as the Kinchilingae saxifrage, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
