    "intro": "Sorengia longifolia subsp. elongata, commonly known as the elongated sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as wetlands and marshy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a tight, cylindrical cluster. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated inflorescence and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
