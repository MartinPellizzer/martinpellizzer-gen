    "intro": "Salix friburgensis, commonly known as the Fribourg willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
