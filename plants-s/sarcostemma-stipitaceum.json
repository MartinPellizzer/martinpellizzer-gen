    "intro": "Sarcostemma stipitaceum, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a climbing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, a common feature among members of the milkweed family. Sarcostemma stipitaceum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
