    "intro": "Salacia wayanadica, commonly known as the Wayanad salacia, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, though it is not closely related to them. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are ovate in shape. It produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
