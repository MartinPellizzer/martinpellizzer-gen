It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its diminutive, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte stage produces spores in specialized structures called strobila, which are borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves.
