It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features slender, arching branches. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are borne on elongated inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, often turning red in the fall. Spiraea affinis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges."
