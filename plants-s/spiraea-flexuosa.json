    "intro": "Spiraea flexuosa, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring arching stems covered in small, fragrant white flowers in early summer. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Spiraea flexuosa is valued for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
