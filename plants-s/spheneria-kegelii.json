It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant has a flattened, green thallus with a distinct central ridge and is characterized by its tiny, clustered capsules for reproduction. Spheneria kegelii is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of the bryophyte flora in its habitat. Its structure and reproductive features make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
