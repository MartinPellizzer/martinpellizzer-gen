    "intro": "Spiranthes coccinea, commonly known as the red twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence of bright red flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a short flowering period in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies. Spiranthes coccinea is a relatively small plant, often growing to a height of only a few inches, but it plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
