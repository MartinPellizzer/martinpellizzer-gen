    "intro": "Salix reinii var. cyclophylloides, commonly known as the cyclophylloides willow, is a rare and specialized variant of the willow genus native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a distinctive, rounded base that sets it apart from other willow species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its floral structure includes catkins, which are typical of the Salicaceae family, and it relies on wind pollination for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
