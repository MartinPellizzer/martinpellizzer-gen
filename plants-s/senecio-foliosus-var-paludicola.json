    "intro": "Senecio foliosus var. paludicola, commonly known as the bog senecio, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in fens and marshes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
