    "intro": "Styphelia tameiameiae var. brevistyla, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a delicate ornamental value to its compact form. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
