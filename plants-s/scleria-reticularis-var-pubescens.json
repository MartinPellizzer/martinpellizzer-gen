    "intro": "Scleria reticularis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy nettlegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in wetland or marshy habitats. The species is adapted to humid environments and is often found in areas with consistent moisture."
