    "intro": "Salix oldhamiana, commonly known as the Chinese weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or red in the fall. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
