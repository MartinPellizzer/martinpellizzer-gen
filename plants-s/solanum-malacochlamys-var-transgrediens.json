    "intro": "Solanum malacochlamys var. transgrediens, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a perennial vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that transition from white to purple as they mature. The plant bears dark purple to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided in agricultural settings."
