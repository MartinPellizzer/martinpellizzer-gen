    "intro": "Solanum olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible when fully mature."
