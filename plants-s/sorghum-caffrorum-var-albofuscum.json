It is characterized by its distinctive pale green to white leaves, which set it apart from other sorghum varieties. The plant typically grows as a tall, annual grass with robust stems and small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is often cultivated for its grain or as a forage crop. Its botanical features make it an important species in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
