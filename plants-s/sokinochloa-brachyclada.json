It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
