    "intro": "Schoenoplectus mucronatus var. antrorsispinulosus, commonly known as the spike rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, greenish-brown spikelets. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and improve water filtration in aquatic ecosystems. Its flowering structures, which are borne on tall, slender stems, are composed of several spikelets arranged in a panicle-like pattern. This variety is distinguished by its unique bract morphology, with backward-curving, spinulose margins that set it apart from other spike rush species."
