    "intro": "Seriphium passerinoides, commonly known as the common hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, seed-filled heads that are dispersed by the wind. Seriphium passerinoides is often found in disturbed areas and can tolerate poor soil conditions."
