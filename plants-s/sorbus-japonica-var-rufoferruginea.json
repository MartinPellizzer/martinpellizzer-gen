    "intro": "Sorbus japonica var. rufoferruginea, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its bark is often covered in a thick, flaky layer that becomes reddish-brown with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
