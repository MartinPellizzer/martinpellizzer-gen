    "intro": "Saxifraga mundula, commonly known as the Antarctic saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and sub-Antarctic islands. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, icy environments, often growing on rocky substrates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom during the brief summer season. Its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Saxifraga mundula plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, providing food for native insects and contributing to the biodiversity of its extreme habitat."
