    "intro": "Saurauia negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros saurauia, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Negros Island. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes shrubs and small trees known for their adaptability to acidic soils. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green in color. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are clustered in dense inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Saurauia negrosensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
