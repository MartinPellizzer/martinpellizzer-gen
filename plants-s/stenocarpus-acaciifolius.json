    "intro": "Stenocarpus acaciifolius, commonly known as the acacia-leaf hakea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody shrub form with dense, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding insects. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for native wildlife, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
