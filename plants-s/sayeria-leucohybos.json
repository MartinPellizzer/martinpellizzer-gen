It is characterized by its striking white and green foliage, with leaves that have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
