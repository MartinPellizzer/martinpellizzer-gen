    "intro": "Schoenus bobartiae, commonly known as the Bobart's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Schoenus bobartiae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
