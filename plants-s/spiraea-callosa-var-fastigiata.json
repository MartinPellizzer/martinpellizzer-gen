It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters along the stems. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements in garden settings."
