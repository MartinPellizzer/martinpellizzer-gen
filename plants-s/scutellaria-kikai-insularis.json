    "intro": "Scutellaria kikai-insularis, commonly known as the Kikai Island skullcap, is a rare flowering plant native to the Kikai Islands in Japan. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its island home. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
