    "intro": "Saxifraga caulescens, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense, compact cushions or mats, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, providing insulation and reducing water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Saxifraga caulescens is well adapted to cold climates and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in open, sunny habitats."
