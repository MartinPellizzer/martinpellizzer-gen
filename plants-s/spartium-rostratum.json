    "intro": "Spartium rostratum, commonly known as narrowleaf sicklevetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces seed pods that are curved and resemble a sickle, giving it its common name. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Spartium rostratum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
