    "intro": "Spiranthes simplex var. neuroptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a species of orchid native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and long, spiral-shaped inflorescences that bear numerous small, white flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
