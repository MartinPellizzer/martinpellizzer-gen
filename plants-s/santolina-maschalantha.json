    "intro": "Santolina maschalantha, commonly known as the Spanish santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, aromatic foliage with silvery-gray leaves that emit a strong, herbaceous scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings."
