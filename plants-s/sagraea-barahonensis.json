    "intro": "Sagraea barahonensis, commonly known as the Barahon mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Barahona in the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Sagraea barahonensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
