    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 stottii, commonly known as the hybrid willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that results from the crossbreeding of several willow species. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. This plant is often found in moist environments such as riverbanks, wetlands, and along streams. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
