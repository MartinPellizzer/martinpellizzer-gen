    "intro": "Suarezia ecuadorana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian suarezia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in moist, shaded areas of cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Suarezia ecuadorana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
