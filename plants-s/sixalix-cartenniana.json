    "intro": "Sixalix cartenniana, commonly known as the mountain snowberry, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
