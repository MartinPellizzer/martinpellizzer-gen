    "intro": "Salix subsericea, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, making it an important species for pollinators. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive flaky texture that peels in thin layers. Salix subsericea is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
