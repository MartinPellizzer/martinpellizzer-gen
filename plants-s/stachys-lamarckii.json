    "intro": "Stachys lamarckii, commonly known as purple mint or narrowleaf hedge nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of small, two-lipped, purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Stachys lamarckii is known for its aromatic leaves, which emit a minty scent when crushed. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks."
