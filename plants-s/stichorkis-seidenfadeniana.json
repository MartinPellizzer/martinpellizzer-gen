    "intro": "Stichorkis seidenfadeniana, commonly known as the Schomburgkia orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild."
