    "intro": "Selaginella uncinata var. arborea, commonly known as the tree moss or climbing spikemoss, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that can climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems, giving it a moss-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with fungi, enhancing its nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils."
