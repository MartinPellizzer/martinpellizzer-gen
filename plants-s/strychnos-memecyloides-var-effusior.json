    "intro": "Strychnos memecyloides var. effusior, commonly known as the creeping strychnos, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
