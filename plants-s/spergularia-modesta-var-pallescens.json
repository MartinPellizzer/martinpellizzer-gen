    "intro": "Spergularia modesta var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to sandy and coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The fruits are small capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
