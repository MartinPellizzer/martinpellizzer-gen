    "intro": "Struthiopteris ensiformis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a horizontal underground stem that produces both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy surface. Struthiopteris ensiformis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
