    "intro": "Sonchus asper var. glandulosus, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem covered in stiff, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single, showy head, with pinnately divided, serrated leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
