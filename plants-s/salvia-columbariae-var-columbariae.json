    "intro": "Salvia columbariae var. columbariae, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant produces tubular flowers that are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
