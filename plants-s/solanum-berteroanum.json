    "intro": "Solanum berteroanum, commonly known as the Bertero's nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly found in countries like Peru and Ecuador. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it bears red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded areas within forests. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and researchers."
