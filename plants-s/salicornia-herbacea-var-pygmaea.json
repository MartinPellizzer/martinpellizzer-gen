    "intro": "Salicornia herbacea var. pygmaea, commonly known as sea bean or dwarf glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a succulent species with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling survival in arid coastal regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are scale-like and often reduced, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Salicornia herbacea var. pygmaea is often found in salt marshes, estuaries, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
