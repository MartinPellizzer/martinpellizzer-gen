    "intro": "Saccoloma inaequale var. caudatum, commonly known as the feather-tailed fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the dappled light. Its fronds are usually arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a delicate, airy appearance. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
