    "intro": "Salix sepicola, commonly known as the bog willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability to moist conditions, Salix sepicola plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
