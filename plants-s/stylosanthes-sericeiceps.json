It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage crop for livestock in dry regions. It has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance. Additionally, as a legume, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
