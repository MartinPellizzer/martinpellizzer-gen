    "intro": "Sayeria pleurodes, commonly known as the pleurodes fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its delicate foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
