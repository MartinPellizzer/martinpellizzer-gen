    "intro": "Saussurea deltoidea subsp. polycephala, commonly known as the Tibetan cloud willow or clouded safflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to cold, arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, providing some insulation against harsh weather conditions. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
