    "intro": "Sonchus abbreviatus, commonly known as common sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and Asia but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America. Sonchus abbreviatus is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
