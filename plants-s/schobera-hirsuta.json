    "intro": "Schobera hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy schobera, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its fibrous roots make it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Schobera hirsuta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
