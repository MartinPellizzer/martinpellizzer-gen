    "intro": "Salix lanata barrattiana, commonly known as the woolly willow, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, typical of the Salicaceae family, and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is adapted to harsh mountain conditions, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
