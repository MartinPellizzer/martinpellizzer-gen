It thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in dune environments and along shorelines. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar adaptations to harsh environments. Spergularia maxima is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it an important pioneer species in coastal succession."
