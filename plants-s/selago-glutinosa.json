    "intro": "Selago glutinosa, commonly known as sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of Australia and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its sticky, glandular hairs on the leaves and stems give it a distinctive appearance and help deter herbivores. Selago glutinosa is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
