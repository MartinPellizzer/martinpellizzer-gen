It is a fast-growing shrub or small tree that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. The plant has compound leaves with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets and produces yellow flowers that are followed by elongated pods. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, woody pod and are often used in traditional medicine. Sesbania tchadica is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural systems."
