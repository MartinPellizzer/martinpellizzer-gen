    "intro": "Sedum grandipetalum, commonly known as the large-petaled stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Sedum grandipetalum is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
