It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spiraling inflorescences. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are typically arranged in a tight, spiral pattern along the stem. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators like bees and moths."
