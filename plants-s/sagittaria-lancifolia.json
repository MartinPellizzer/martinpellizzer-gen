    "intro": "Sagittaria lancifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf arrowhead, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with slender, ribbon-like leaves emerging from the water. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. Sagittaria lancifolia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
