The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and have a fine, grass-like texture. Sinarundinaria microphylla thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for landscaping."
