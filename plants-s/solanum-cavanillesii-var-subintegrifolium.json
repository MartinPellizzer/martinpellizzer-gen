    "intro": "Solanum cavanillesii var. subintegrifolium, commonly known as the white-flowered nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
