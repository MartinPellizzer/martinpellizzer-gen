    "intro": "Solanum tergosericeum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or white, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and peppers. Solanum tergosericeum is often used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution."
