    "intro": "Solanum grossularia subsp. protaxanthum, commonly known as the red devil apple, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking red, fleshy fruits that resemble small apples. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a glossy texture, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
