    "intro": "Sclerocactus whipplei var. intermedius, commonly known as the Intermediate Whipple Cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the rocky, arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its tall, columnar stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in late spring and are relatively short-lived. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
