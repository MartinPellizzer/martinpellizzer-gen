It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, two-lipped flowers in shades of blue or purple. Scutellaria ovalifolia is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ethnobotanical research."
