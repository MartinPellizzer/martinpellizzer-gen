    "intro": "Stipa tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense clusters of narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with delicate, feathery bristles. Stipa tibetica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various high-altitude organisms."
