    "intro": "Siphocampylus declinatus, commonly known as the leaning campylus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can receive adequate light without being exposed to direct sunlight. Its foliage consists of finely divided leaves that are often aromatic, and it produces small white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Siphocampylus declinatus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
