    "intro": "Striga pubiflora var. zanzibarensis, commonly known as the Zanzibar striga, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with four petals, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
