    "intro": "Symplocos glauca var. glauca, commonly known as the bluebead lily, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy, bluish sheen. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, blue-black berries that are edible but tart. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for native gardens. Symplocos glauca var. glauca thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade."
