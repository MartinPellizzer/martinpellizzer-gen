    "intro": "Spiranthes hemichrea, commonly known as the narrowleaf ladies' tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spiraling inflorescence of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, tuberous roots that help it survive in wet conditions. Spiranthes hemichrea is often found in prairie and wetland habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
