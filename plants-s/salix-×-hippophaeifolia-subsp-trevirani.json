    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 hippophaeifolia subsp. trevirani, commonly known as the white willow, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control in certain regions."
