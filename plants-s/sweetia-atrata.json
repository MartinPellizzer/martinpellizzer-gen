    "intro": "Sweetia atrata, commonly known as the black sweetia, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Sweetia atrata is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by plant enthusiasts and researchers."
