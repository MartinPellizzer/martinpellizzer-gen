    "intro": "Stipa neesiana var. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-bracted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, bracted florets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. This variety is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
