    "intro": "Salsola tragus subsp. iberica, commonly known as Iberian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a common weed in Mediterranean regions."
