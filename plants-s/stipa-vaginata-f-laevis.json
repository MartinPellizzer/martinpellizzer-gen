    "intro": "Stipa vaginata f. laevis, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a variant of the slender bluegrass species. It is a perennial grass native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green coloration, which is due to the presence of a waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, giving it a fluffy appearance. This form is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves, distinguishing it from other forms of Stipa vaginata."
