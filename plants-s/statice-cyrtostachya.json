    "intro": "Statice cyrtostachya, commonly known as the sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, showy pink to purple flowers. The plant is well adapted to saline and well-drained soils, often thriving in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are narrow and silver-gray, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Statice cyrtostachya is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
