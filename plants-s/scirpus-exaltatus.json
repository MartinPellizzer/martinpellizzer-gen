    "intro": "Scirpus exaltatus, commonly known as tall bulrush, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and its dense, cylindrical clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and improve water filtration in wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Scirpus exaltatus plays an important ecological role in providing habitat for aquatic and wetland organisms."
