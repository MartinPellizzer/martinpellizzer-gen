    "intro": "Stenostephanus wasshausenii, commonly known as the Wasshausen's stephanus, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
