    "intro": "Saxifraga \u00d7 rigescens, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with cold climates."
