    "intro": "Saxifraga retusa var. augustata, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, moss-like hairs. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are borne on slender stems and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a characteristic component of alpine flora."
