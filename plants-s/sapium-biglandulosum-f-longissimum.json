    "intro": "Sapium biglandulosum f. longissimum, commonly known as the long-leaved Chinese tallowtree, is a variant of the Chinese tallowtree characterized by its elongated, lanceolate leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are often longer and more slender compared to the typical form, making it distinct in appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
