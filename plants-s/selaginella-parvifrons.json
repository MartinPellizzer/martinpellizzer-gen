    "intro": "Selaginella parvifrons, commonly known as the small-fruited spikemoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces spores rather than seeds. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Selaginella parvifrons is an evergreen plant that retains its foliage year-round. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
