    "intro": "Swartzia tomentifera, commonly known as the velvetwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, simple leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Swartzia tomentifera is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, lowland forests. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental features."
