    "intro": "Sonchus exauriculatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by bristly, spherical seed heads. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some areas."
