    "intro": "Syzygium austrosinense, commonly known as the Australian apple or the red apple tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly Queensland and New South Wales, where it grows in subtropical and tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and appear in clusters, followed by edible, red, apple-like fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
