    "intro": "Securidaca legitima, commonly known as the African stranglewood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including savannas and rocky areas, and is often found in dry environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets, it can become invasive in certain regions."
