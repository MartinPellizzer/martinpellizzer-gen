    "intro": "Stichorkis kerintjiensis, commonly known as the Kerintjiensis orchid, is a rare and lesser-known species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit. The plant features a short rhizome with a few fleshy roots and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are elongated, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
