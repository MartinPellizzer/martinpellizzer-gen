    "intro": "Sapium cornutum var. coriaceum, commonly known as the tough-leaf cudweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are coriaceous, meaning they are thick and leathery, which helps it retain moisture. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
