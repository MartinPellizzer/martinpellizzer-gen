    "intro": "Sonchus fallax var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
