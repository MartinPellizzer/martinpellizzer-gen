    "intro": "Struthiopteris lineata, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, linear shape that gives the plant its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the summer months."
