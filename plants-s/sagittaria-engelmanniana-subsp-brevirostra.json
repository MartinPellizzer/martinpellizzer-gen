    "intro": "Sagittaria engelmanniana subsp. brevirostra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are narrow and pointed, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems rise above the water, producing small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and stabilizing wetland habitats."
