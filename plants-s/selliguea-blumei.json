    "intro": "Selliguea blumei, commonly known as the Blume's liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its closely spaced, elongated leaves that form a dense, carpet-like growth. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems called setae. Selliguea blumei plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
