    "intro": "Silene rupestris var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf rock catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with a compact growth form that helps it conserve moisture. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it relies on seed dispersal for propagation. Silene rupestris var. pumila is often found in alpine and coastal regions where it thrives in well-drained soils."
