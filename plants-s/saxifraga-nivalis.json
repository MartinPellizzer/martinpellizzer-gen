    "intro": "Saxifraga nivalis, commonly known as the snow saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually clustered at the base and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Saxifraga nivalis plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in mountainous areas."
