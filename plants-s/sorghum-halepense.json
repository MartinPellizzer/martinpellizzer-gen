    "intro": "Sorghum halepense, commonly known as Johnsongrass, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is highly invasive and can form dense stands that outcompete native vegetation. Due to its aggressive growth and adaptability, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world."
