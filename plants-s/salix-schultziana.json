    "intro": "Salix schultziana, commonly known as the Schultze willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Salix schultziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
