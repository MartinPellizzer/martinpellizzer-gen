    "intro": "Succisa ustulata, commonly known as the fireweed or common fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in meadows, and in open woodlands. Succisa ustulata is known for its ability to colonize areas after fires or other disturbances, hence its common name."
