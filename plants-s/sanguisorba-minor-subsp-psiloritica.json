    "intro": "Sanguisorba minor subsp. psiloritica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and a distinctive sour taste due to its high concentration of malic acid. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
