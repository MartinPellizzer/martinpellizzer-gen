It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, dry climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing yellow disk florets surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets."
