    "intro": "Saxifraga caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense clusters of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Saxifraga caespitosa is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
