    "intro": "Salix myrsinites var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky willow, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down, giving it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, typical of willow species. Its flowers are pollinated by wind, and it typically blooms in early spring before the leaves fully develop. The silky willow is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
