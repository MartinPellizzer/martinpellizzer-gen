    "intro": "Saxifraga caspica, commonly known as the Caspian saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often succulent and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Saxifraga caspica thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments."
