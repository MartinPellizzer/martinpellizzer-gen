    "intro": "Sciodaphyllum angulatum, commonly known as the angular shadeplant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the misty cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, angular leaf morphology, which is adapted to maximize light absorption in its shaded habitat. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and has a distinctive root system that helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Sciodaphyllum angulatum is considered a critically endangered species."
