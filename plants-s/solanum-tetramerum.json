    "intro": "Solanum tetramerum, commonly known as the four-lobed nightshade, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its small, egg-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. Solanum tetramerum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
