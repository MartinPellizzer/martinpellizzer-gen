    "intro": "Salix cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams, wetlands, and riverbanks. Salix cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
