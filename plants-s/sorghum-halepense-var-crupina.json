    "intro": "Sorghum halepense var. crupina, commonly known as yellow foxtail, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and distinctive yellowish-green, finger-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are small and produce a fluffy, wind-dispersed material that contributes to its invasive potential. Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
