    "intro": "Sericocarpus oregonensis var. oregonensis, commonly known as the Oregon biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, woolly, club-shaped fruits called sericocarps. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, and is adapted to cool, moist environments. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
