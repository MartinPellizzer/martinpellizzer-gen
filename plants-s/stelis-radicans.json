    "intro": "[WRONG START] Steles radicans, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, tropical environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features long, trailing stems that can extend several feet, with clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Stelis radicans is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cascade elegantly from hanging baskets or shelves."
