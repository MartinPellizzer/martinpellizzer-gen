    "intro": "Sesquicella triangulata, commonly known as the three-angled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique, triangular-shaped leaves that are often inflated, resembling small bladders. The plant is a carnivorous species, using its specialized leaf structures to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its distribution is primarily in Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in nutrient-poor waters."
