    "intro": "Solanum chacoense, commonly known as the Chaco nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its berries are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Solanum chacoense is adapted to dry, arid environments and is often found in shrublands and dry forests."
