    "intro": "Sulcorebutia caracarensis, commonly known as the Caracarensis Candelabra Cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of South America. It is a low-growing, clumping cactus with a distinctive, multi-branched structure that resembles a candle. The plant features cylindrical stems covered in white to yellow spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and are tubular in shape, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Sulcorebutia caracarensis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
