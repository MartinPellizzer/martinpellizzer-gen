    "intro": "Styphelia pentapogona, commonly known as the five-lobed wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet heathlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Styphelia pentapogona thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment. It is a low-growing plant, often forming dense thickets that provide habitat for various small animals and insects."
