    "intro": "Sapindus microcarpus, commonly known as the soapberry tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, round, spiny fruits. The fruits contain a single seed surrounded by a starchy, soap-like pulp that is used in traditional soap-making. This plant is also valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
