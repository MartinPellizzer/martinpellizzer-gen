    "intro": "Saracha herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's saracha, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid conditions. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Saracha herrerae is considered a species of conservation concern."
