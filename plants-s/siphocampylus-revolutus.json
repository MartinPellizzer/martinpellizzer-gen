    "intro": "Siphocampylus revolutus, commonly known as the curled leaf gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
