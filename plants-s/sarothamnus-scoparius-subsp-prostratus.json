    "intro": "Sarothamnus scoparius subsp. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate thimbleweed, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, prostrate stems that form dense mats, often covering the ground with a thick layer of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
