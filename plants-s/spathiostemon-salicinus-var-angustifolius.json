    "intro": "Spathiostemon salicinus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow-herb, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, often hairy stems that grow from a rhizomatous base, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are lanceolate, typically narrow and tapering, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, with white or pale yellow petals. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
