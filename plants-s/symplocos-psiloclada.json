    "intro": "Symplocos psiloclada, commonly known as the red-flowered inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, red flowers that are followed by dark blue to black berries. These berries are edible but have a high tannin content, making them bitter when raw. Symplocos psiloclada is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
