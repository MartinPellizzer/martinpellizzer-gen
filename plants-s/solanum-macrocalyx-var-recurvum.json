    "intro": "Solanum macrocalyx var. recurvum, commonly known as the recurved nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features erect, often branched stems with hairy surfaces, and its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by berries that mature to a bright red color. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
