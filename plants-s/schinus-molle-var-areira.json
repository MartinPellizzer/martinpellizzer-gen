    "intro": "Schinus molle var. areira, commonly known as the areca or the \"Brazilian pepper,\" is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves and small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces copious amounts of fragrant flowers, which are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it an invasive species in some areas."
