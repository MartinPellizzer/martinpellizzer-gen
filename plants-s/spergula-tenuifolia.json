    "intro": "Spergula tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Spergula tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
