    "intro": "Stelis cymbiformis, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive helmet-shaped lip. Its leaves are elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in water retention. Stelis cymbiformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
