    "intro": "Salix proteifolia, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically tinged with white or silver on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. Salix proteifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in forested areas."
