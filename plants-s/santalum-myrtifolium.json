    "intro": "Santalum myrtifolium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark red or reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its unique scent and durability. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Santalum myrtifolium is also a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system."
