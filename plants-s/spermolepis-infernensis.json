    "intro": "Spermolepis infernensis, commonly known as the infernal candelabra, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching structure and vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. However, it is considered rare and is often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
