    "intro": "Sempervivum marmoreum subsp. reginae-amaliae, commonly known as the Queen Amalia's Stonecrop, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to the Pyrenees region. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are adorned with distinctive pink or purple markings. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form tight, compact clusters that resist wind and frost."
