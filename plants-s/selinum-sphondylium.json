    "intro": "Selinum sphondylium, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It has a creeping growth habit with multiple stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Selinum sphondylium is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
