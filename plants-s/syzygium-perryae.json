    "intro": "Syzygium perryae, commonly known as the Perry's tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the Myrtaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible and have a tart, acidic flavor. Syzygium perryae is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological importance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
