It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its delicate, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanical research."
