    "intro": "Satyrium ecalcaratum, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a yellow-green lip and a white or greenish-yellow dorsal sepal, often adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
