    "intro": "Selaginella societatis, commonly known as the Society's spikemoss, is a rare and endangered species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces cone-like structures called strobila, which contain the reproductive organs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils under shaded conditions, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
