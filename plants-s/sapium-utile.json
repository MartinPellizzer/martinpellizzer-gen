    "intro": "Sapium utile, commonly known as the Chinese tallowtree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain sticky, waxy seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other parts of the world. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
