    "intro": "Secondatia densiflora var. paraguariensis, commonly known as the Paraguayan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, woody trunk, which contributes to its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, edible fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
