It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that can be used as a natural soap, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Saponaria chlorifolia is a hardy perennial that is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
