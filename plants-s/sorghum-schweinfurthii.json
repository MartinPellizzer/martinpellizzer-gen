    "intro": "Sorghum schweinfurthii, commonly known as red sorghum, is a tall, annual grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its striking red or purple stalks and leaves, which are often used in traditional ceremonies and as ornamental plants. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it well-suited for marginal agricultural lands. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and culturally valued in many regions."
