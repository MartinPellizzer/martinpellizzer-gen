    "intro": "Spiradiclis bifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spiralwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, with a distinct division at the base, giving it the species name *bifida*. Spiradiclis bifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
