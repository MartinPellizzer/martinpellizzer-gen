    "intro": "Stillingia desertorum, commonly known as the desert stillingia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that appear in late spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Stillingia desertorum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-water conditions."
