    "intro": "Stenorrhynchos vaginatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it has a distinctive pseudobulb structure typical of many orchid species. The flowers are usually short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and flies."
