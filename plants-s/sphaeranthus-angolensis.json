It is a herbaceous annual with erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Sphaeranthus angolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
