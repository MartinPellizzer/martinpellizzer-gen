    "intro": "Sorbus canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Sorbus canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in supporting local wildlife."
