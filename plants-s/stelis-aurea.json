    "intro": "Stelis aurea, commonly known as the golden stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features slender, erect stems and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Stelis aurea is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
