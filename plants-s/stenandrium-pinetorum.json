    "intro": "Stenandrium pinetorum, commonly known as the pine fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's botanical structure includes a short, creeping rhizome with numerous compound leaves that are finely divided. Its reproductive system involves the production of spores rather than seeds, typical of ferns. Stenandrium pinetorum is often found growing in association with pine trees, hence its common name."
