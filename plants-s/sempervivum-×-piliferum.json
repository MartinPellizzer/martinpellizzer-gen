It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a woolly texture, often adorned with red or purple tips. The plant produces pink or red flowers in summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh climates."
