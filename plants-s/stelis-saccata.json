    "intro": "Stelis saccata, commonly known as the sac-like stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with dense, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in a raceme, with a distinctive sac-like structure at the base of the flower. Stelis saccata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens for its unique floral characteristics."
