    "intro": "Siphocampylus sevegnaniae, commonly known as the Sevegnanian siphocampylus, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to a very limited geographic region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring tubular corollas with prominent lobes and a distinctive coloration pattern. The plant exhibits a specific pollination mechanism, relying on a particular insect species for reproductive success. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
