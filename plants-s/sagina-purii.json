    "intro": "Sagina purii, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its tiny, scale-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are low and growing seasons are short. Sagina purii plays a role in stabilizing soil in these extreme habitats and is a common component of alpine flora."
