    "intro": "Salix hirticaulis, commonly known as the rough-stemmed willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems that are covered with short, stiff hairs. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture, often with a bluish-green hue on the upper surface. It produces catkins in early spring, which are the plant's primary means of reproduction. This species is typically found in wet or moist habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows."
