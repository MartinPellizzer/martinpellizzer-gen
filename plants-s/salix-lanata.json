    "intro": "Salix lanata, commonly known as the downy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems and oval, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and smaller, clustered female flowers, typical of willow species. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. Salix lanata is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian habitats."
