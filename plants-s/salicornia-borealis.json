    "intro": "Salicornia borealis, commonly known as sea beans or glasswort, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is a perennial succulent that thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other regions with high salt content. The plant produces small, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, typically appearing in green or reddish hues. Salicornia borealis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
