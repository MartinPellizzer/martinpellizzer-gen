    "intro": "Selaginella gebaueriana, commonly known as the Gebauer's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in cone-like structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella gebaueriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
