    "intro": "Selaginella anisotis, commonly known as the zigzag moss or zigzag strobilus, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, creeping stems and distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a zigzag appearance. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. Selaginella anisotis produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that contain both microspores and megaspores. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
