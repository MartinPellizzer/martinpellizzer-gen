    "intro": "Senecio urumovii, commonly known as the Urumov's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio urumovii is often found in mountainous areas and is part of the diverse flora of its native habitat."
