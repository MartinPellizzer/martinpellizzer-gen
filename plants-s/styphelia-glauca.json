    "intro": "Styphelia glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically a bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Styphelia glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
