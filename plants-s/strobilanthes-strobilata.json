    "intro": "Strobilanthes strobilata, commonly known as the flame flower or sacred flame, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its short blooming period, typically during the rainy season. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, though it is relatively rare in cultivation. The species is also culturally significant in certain regions, where it is associated with religious and ceremonial practices."
