    "intro": "Syzygium urceolatum, commonly known as the water apple or rain tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the nodes. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round, yellowish fruits with a juicy, sweet pulp. The fruit is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
