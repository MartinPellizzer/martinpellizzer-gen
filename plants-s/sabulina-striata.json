    "intro": "Sabulina striata, commonly known as the striped rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are small, white, and arranged in clusters. Sabulina striata is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its unique striated leaves and compact growth form make it a distinctive member of the Brassicaceae family."
