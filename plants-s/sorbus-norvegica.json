    "intro": "Sorbus norvegica, commonly known as the mountain ash or whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bright red or orange berries in the autumn. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its durability and resistance to decay."
