    "intro": "Sicyocarya rockii, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
