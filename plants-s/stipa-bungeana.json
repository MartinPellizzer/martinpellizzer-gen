    "intro": "Stipa bungeana, commonly known as the Bunge's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in drought conditions. Stipa bungeana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
