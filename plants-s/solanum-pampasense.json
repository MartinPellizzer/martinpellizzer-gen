    "intro": "Solanum pampasense, commonly known as the Pampas nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its toxic compounds, it is generally avoided by livestock and humans."
