    "intro": "Smilax ornata, commonly known as the yellow smilax, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy, often yellowish-green surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible for humans and birds but contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Smilax ornata is often found in moist woodlands and is known for its ability to climb or trail along the ground."
