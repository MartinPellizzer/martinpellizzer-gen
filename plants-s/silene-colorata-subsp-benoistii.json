    "intro": "Silene colorata subsp. benoistii, commonly known as the Benoist's campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
