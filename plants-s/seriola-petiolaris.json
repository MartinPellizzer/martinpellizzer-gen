    "intro": "Seriola petiolaris, commonly known as the yellowtail snapper, is a marine fish belonging to the family Carangidae. It is characterized by its elongated, laterally compressed body and a distinctive yellowish coloration. The species is native to the tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Its botanical aspects are less relevant since it is a marine fish, but it is often found in coastal and reef environments. The plant-like structures in its habitat, such as seagrass beds and coral reefs, provide essential ecological niches for its survival."
