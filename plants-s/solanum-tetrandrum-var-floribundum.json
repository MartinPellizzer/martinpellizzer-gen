    "intro": "Solanum tetrandrum var. floribundum, commonly known as the showy nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright stems covered in sticky hairs and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant bears berries that start green and mature to a bright red, often containing toxic alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
