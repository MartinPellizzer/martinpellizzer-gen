    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 rubens var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a hybrid willow species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist to submerged soils, making it a common sight in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological succession. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
