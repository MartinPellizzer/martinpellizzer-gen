    "intro": "Scirpus californicus subsp. tatora, commonly known as California bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, contributing to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and the plant plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems."
