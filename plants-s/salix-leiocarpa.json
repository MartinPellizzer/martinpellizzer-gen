    "intro": "Salix leiocarpa, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive white to pale yellow bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, often with a bluish-green hue. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that mature in late summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
