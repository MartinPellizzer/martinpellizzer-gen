It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a reddish or purplish tinge. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight waxy coating. Stylidium longissimum is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
