    "intro": "Sida glanduligera, commonly known as sticky sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs, which give it a sticky texture and help in water retention. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Sida glanduligera is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
