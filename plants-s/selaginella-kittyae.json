It is a small, evergreen moss-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorled leaves that are often bright green and covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Selaginella kittyae reproduces via spores, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and a sporophyte stage. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
