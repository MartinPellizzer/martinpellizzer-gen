    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 cuspidata, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that droop gracefully, creating a weeping appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has narrow, elongated leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues in the fall. It thrives in moist environments, such as riverbanks and wetlands, and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. The bark of Salix \u00d7 cuspidata is typically smooth and light gray, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the tree matures."
