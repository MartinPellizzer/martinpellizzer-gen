    "intro": "Saxifraga lingulata bellardii, commonly known as the bellard's saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered leaves that are typically spoon-shaped or spatulate, and its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in early summer. It is a member of the Saxifragaceae family, which includes several other rock-dwelling plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
