    "intro": "Stenanthium gramineum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, yellowish-green inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
