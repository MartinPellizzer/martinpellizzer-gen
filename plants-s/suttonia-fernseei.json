    "intro": "Suttonia fernseei, commonly known as the Fernsee Island fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the island of Fernsee in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests or rocky crevices. Its spores are released in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Suttonia fernseei is considered a vulnerable species."
