    "intro": "Stenandriopsis keraudrenae, commonly known as the Keraudren's stenandriopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its botanical features include small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the wet season, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
