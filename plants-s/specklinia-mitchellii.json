    "intro": "Specklinia mitchellii, commonly known as the Mitchell's cycad, is a species of cycad native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of pinnately compound leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid, both of which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Specklinia mitchellii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
