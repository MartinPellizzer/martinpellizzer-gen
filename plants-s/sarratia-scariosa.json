    "intro": "Sarratia scariosa, commonly known as the scarlet lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers with prominent yellow stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Sarratia scariosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native plant landscapes."
