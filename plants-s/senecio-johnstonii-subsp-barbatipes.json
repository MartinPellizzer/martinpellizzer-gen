    "intro": "Senecio johnstonii subsp. barbatipes, commonly known as Johnston's groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its harsh, dry habitat, with a low-growing form and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
