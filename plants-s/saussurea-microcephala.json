    "intro": "Saussurea microcephala, commonly known as the Tibetan groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in cold, arid environments with poor soil. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Saussurea microcephala is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicine."
