    "intro": "Sesamum biapiculatum, commonly known as the two-awned sesame, is a species native to tropical Africa. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into capsules containing numerous tiny, oval-shaped seeds. Its botanical features include hairy foliage and a fibrous root system, which aid in its adaptation to arid environments. Sesamum biapiculatum is primarily cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
