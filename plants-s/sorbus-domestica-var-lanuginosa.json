    "intro": "Sorbus domestica var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly whitebeam, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray or white pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. This plant is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
