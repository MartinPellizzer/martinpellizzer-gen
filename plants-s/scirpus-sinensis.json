    "intro": "Scirpus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often growing in moist or aquatic environments. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or brown in color, and it blooms from summer to autumn. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Scirpus sinensis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and water filtration."
