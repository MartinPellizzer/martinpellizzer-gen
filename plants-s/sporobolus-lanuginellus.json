    "intro": "Sporobolus lanuginellus, commonly known as silky sandbar grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and tufted inflorescences, which are typically composed of spikelets. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and arid environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sporobolus lanuginellus is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in low-nutrient environments."
