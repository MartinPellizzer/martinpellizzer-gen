    "intro": "Sanguisorba agrimoniifolia, commonly known as the agrimonious sweetroot, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are arranged in panicles. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Sanguisorba agrimoniifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
