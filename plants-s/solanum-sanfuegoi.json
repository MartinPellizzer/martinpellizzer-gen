    "intro": "Solanum sanfuegoi, commonly known as the San Fuego nightshade, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and they contain toxic alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanum genus. Solanum sanfuegoi is often found in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and pharmacological research."
