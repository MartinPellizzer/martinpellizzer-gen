    "intro": "Selaginella manausensis, commonly known as the Manaus spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant native to the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobila. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on decaying wood or in rocky crevices. Due to habitat destruction, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important subject for botanical research."
