    "intro": "Schizojacquemontia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its striking, pale blue to violet flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Schizojacquemontia is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing minute seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
