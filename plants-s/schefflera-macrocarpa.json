    "intro": "Schefflera macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a distinctive umbrella-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Schefflera macrocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
