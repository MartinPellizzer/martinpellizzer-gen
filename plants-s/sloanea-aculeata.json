    "intro": "Sloanea aculeata, commonly known as the prickly sloanea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its woody structure and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture with small glands, while its stems are covered in stiff, spiny hairs. Sloanea aculeata is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
