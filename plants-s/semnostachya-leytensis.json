    "intro": "Semnostachya leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
