    "intro": "Stellaria borealis lusus glabra, commonly known as the northern starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, silky hairs, and its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. The species is adapted to cold climates and has a low profile to avoid damage from strong winds and freezing temperatures."
