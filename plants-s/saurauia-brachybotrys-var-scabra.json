    "intro": "Saurauia brachybotrys var. scabra, commonly known as the rough-leaved saurauia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Ericaceae family."
