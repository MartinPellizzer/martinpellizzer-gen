It produces striking clusters of bell-shaped, sky-blue flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
