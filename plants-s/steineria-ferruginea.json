    "intro": "Steineria ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty steineria, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes plants like philodendrons and calla lilies, and is characterized by its distinctive foliage and inflorescence. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish-brown margin, giving the plant its common name. It produces an unusual, spadix-like flower structure that is often surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Steineria ferruginea is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment."
