    "intro": "Sophora tomentosa var. truncata, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its grayish-brown, smooth bark and trifoliate leaves that are hairy when young. The plant produces long, drooping clusters of fragrant, pale blue to purple pea-like flowers in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release hairy, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy blooms."
