    "intro": "Sporobolus gracilis, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Sporobolus gracilis is often found in grassland ecosystems and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
