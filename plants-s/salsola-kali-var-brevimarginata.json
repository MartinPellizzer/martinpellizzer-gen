    "intro": "Salsola kali var. brevimarginata, commonly known as Russian thistle or goatweed, is a flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny, deltoid-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to Eurasia but has been introduced to many regions around the world. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in many areas."
