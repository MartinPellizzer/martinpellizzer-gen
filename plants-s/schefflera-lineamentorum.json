    "intro": "Schefflera lineamentorum, commonly known as the veiny schefflera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that have a unique, veined appearance, giving it a striking visual appeal. The plant typically grows in dense, humid environments and prefers well-drained soil. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Schefflera lineamentorum is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
