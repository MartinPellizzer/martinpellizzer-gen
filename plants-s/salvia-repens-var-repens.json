    "intro": "Salvia repens var. repens, commonly known as creeping sage, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are gray-green, hairy, and aromatic, with a strong mint-like scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
