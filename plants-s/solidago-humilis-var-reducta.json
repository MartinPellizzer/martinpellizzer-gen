    "intro": "Solidago humilis var. reducta, commonly known as the reduced golden tickseed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-orange flower clusters in the late summer and early fall. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its foliage is often densely packed, giving it a mat-like appearance. It is valued in native plant gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
