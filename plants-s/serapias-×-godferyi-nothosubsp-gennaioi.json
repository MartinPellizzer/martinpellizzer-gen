    "intro": "Serapias \u00d7 godferyi nothosubsp. gennaioi, commonly known as the January serapias, is a hybrid orchid native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features showy, orange-red to yellow petals with distinctive markings, and its leaves are usually basal, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in its native range."
