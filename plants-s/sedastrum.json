    "intro": "Sedastrum, commonly known as the common sedum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. It consists of about 600 species, many of which are succulent, characterized by thick, fleshy leaves that store water. These plants are native to temperate and arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, yellow, or red. Sedastrum species are often used in rock gardens and as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
