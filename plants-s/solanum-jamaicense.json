    "intro": "Solanum jamaicense, commonly known as Jamaican nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces berries that range in color from green to red, containing seeds within a fleshy pulp. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but has been studied for its potential medicinal uses."
