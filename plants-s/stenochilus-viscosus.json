    "intro": "Stenochilus viscosus, commonly known as the sticky stenochilus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant is notable for its sticky secretions on the leaf surfaces, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying vibrant colors to attract pollinators. Stenochilus viscosus is often found in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in humid and cool climates."
