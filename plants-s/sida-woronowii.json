    "intro": "Sida woronowii, commonly known as the silky sida, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as coastal areas and wetlands. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Sida woronowii belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and it is characterized by its sympodial growth pattern. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivorous insects."
