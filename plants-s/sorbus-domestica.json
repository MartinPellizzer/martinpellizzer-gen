    "intro": "Sorbus domestica, commonly known as the common whitebeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly palatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall. Sorbus domestica is often found in woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
