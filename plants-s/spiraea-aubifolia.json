    "intro": "Spiraea aubifolia, commonly known as meadow spiraea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features slender, arching stems covered in small, oval leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage turns a vibrant yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. Spiraea aubifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and open woodlands."
