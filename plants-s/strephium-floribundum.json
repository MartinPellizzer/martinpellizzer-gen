    "intro": "Strephium floribundum, commonly known as the clustered twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the eastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers. Strephium floribundum is known for its lack of visible stems, as it relies on rhizomes for growth and propagation. Due to its delicate nature, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
