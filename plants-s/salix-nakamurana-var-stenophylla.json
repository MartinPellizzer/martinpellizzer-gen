    "intro": "Salix nakamurana var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf willow, is a variant of the Nakamura willow native to Japan. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverbanks and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
