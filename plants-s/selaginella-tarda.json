    "intro": "Selaginella tarda, commonly known as the common spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping, branched stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. It is a vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate cones, which are typical of its evolutionary lineage. Selaginella tarda is notable for its ability to survive desiccation, a trait that allows it to endure periods of drought. Its structure and reproductive features make it an important component of many temperate and tropical ecosystems."
