It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of valerian. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, often found in gardens and naturalized areas. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
