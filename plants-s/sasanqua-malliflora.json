The plant typically blooms in late autumn to early winter, making it a popular ornamental species in temperate climates. It prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, and it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value. Sasanqua malliflora is also valued for its ability to thrive in coastal areas due to its tolerance for salt spray."
