    "intro": "Sida alnifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its fibrous roots and low-growing habit make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping."
