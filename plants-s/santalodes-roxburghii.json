    "intro": "Santalodes roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through its root system. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive elliptical shape with a glossy surface. The flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators."
