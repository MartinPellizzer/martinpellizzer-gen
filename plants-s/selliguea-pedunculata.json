    "intro": "Selliguea pedunculata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leaf-like structure that aids in photosynthesis. Its reproductive structures, including both male and female gametophores, are closely clustered on the thallus. Selliguea pedunculata is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
