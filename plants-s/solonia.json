    "intro": "Solonia, commonly known as the common solonia, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Solonia is native to Europe and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
