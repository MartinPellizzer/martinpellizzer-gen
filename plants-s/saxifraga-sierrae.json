    "intro": "Saxifraga sierrae, commonly known as Sierra saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, often on slopes and talus. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
