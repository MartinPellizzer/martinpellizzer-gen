    "intro": "Santolina montiberica, commonly known as the rock santolina, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage with a strong aromatic scent, which is due to its high concentration of essential oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Santolina montiberica is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
