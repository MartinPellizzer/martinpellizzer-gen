    "intro": "Stipa hymenoides, commonly known as the silky needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, silky hairs that cover its leaves and inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish hues. Stipa hymenoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
