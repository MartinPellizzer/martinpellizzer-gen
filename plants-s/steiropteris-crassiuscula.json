It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, shield-shaped fronds that form a dense canopy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk and roots, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil. Steiropteris crassiuscula plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and habitat for various organisms."
