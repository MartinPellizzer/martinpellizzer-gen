    "intro": "Symphyotrichum patens var. patentissimum, commonly known as the showy goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and pond edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators during the late growing season."
