    "intro": "Senecio cymbalariifolius var. hastifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved senecio, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features striking, elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
