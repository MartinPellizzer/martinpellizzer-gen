    "intro": "Schweinfurthia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Primulaceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Schweinfurthia species are characterized by their low-growing habit, with hairy stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, and the plants often thrive in rocky or alpine environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in cool, high-altitude conditions."
