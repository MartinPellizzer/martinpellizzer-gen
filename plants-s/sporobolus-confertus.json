    "intro": "Sporobolus confertus, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and produces small, spikelike inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, a feature that contributes to its ability to colonize open, disturbed areas. Sporobolus confertus is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
