    "intro": "Sceptridium triangularifolium, commonly known as the triangular-leaf clubmoss, is a species of small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are clustered in dense, cone-like structures at the base of the stems. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Due to its low-growing habit and ancient lineage, it is considered a living fossil, offering insights into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
