    "intro": "Stipa langshanica, commonly known as the Langshan needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Stipa langshanica is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils."
