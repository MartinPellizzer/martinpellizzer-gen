    "intro": "Swartzia hilairiana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters and has compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
