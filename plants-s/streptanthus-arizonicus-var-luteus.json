It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
