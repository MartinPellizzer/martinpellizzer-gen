    "intro": "Schizachyrium djalonicum, commonly known as the eastern grass or tall grass panicum, is a native North American grass species that thrives in a variety of soil types. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance, especially in late summer and autumn. It is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. Schizachyrium djalonicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
