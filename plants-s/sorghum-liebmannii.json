    "intro": "Sorghum liebmannii, commonly known as wild sorghum, is a robust, drought-tolerant grass native to Africa. It features tall, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often pale pink to red in hue. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species for ecological resilience. Its seeds are edible and have been used by indigenous communities for food and traditional practices."
