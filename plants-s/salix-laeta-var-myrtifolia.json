    "intro": "Salix laeta var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the silver willow or white willow, is a variant of the willow tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often silvery underneath. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems, and the bark is smooth and light-colored. This species is often found in moist, temperate environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
