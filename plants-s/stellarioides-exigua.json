    "intro": "Stellarioides exigua, commonly known as the small starwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has small, pale green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are star-shaped, with five petals that are usually white or pale pink. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
