It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and striking inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in cylindrical or spike-like formations. Its seeds are encased in woody, fibrous capsules that remain on the plant for several years.
