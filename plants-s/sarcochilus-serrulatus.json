    "intro": "Sarcochilus serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated sarcocarp, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It features a hairy, fleshy rhizome and produces striking, dark green to purple flowers with prominent, toothed sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, and it is known for its distinctive, spurred lip. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
