    "intro": "Saxifraga lepismigena, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like growth. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and barren environments, where it can tolerate extreme cold and poor soil conditions. Saxifraga lepismigena is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
