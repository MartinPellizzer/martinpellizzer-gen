    "intro": "Scrophularia lhasaensis, commonly known as the Lhasa scrophularia, is a perennial herb native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its erect stem and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular flowers, typically in shades of pink or purple, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region."
