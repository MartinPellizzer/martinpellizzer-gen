    "intro": "Sambucus nigra fastigiata, commonly known as the upright elderberry, is a compact, shrub-like form of the common elderberry. It features dense, upright growth with small, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. It is native to Europe and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden borders and hedging."
