    "intro": "Stipa barbata var. brevipila, commonly known as the short-bracted needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, with the bracts being shorter than those of the typical variety. This variant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in harsh conditions."
