    "intro": "Smithia goetzei, commonly known as the Goetze's stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Smithia goetzei is also noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades in suitable conditions."
