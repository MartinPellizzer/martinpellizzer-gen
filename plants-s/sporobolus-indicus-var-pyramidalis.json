    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
