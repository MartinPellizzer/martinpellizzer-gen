It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Senecio pudicus is adapted to arid conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
