    "intro": "Saurauia sakoembangensis, commonly known as the Sakoembang mountain laurel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and rhododendrons, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy floral displays. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or mossy substrates. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
