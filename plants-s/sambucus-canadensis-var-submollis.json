    "intro": "Sambucus canadensis var. submollis, commonly known as the smooth elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically smooth and oval-shaped, and its clusters of small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces dark purple berries in late summer, which are edible when ripe but toxic when unripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance as a food source for birds and wildlife."
