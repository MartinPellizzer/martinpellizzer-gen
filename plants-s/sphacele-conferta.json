    "intro": "Sphacele conferta, commonly known as the clustered bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while the stems may be floating or rooted in the substrate. Sphacele conferta is notable for its specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
