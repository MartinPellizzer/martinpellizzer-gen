    "intro": "Specklinia cuspidata, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds with serrated edges. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Specklinia cuspidata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
