    "intro": "Sphaerocionium simplex, commonly known as the smooth globular cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and smooth, greenish-gray skin. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb water from the soil surface. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
