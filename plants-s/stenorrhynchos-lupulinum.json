It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in specialized leaf structures known as sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and delicate structure make it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
