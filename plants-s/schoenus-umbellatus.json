    "intro": "Schoenus umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and distinctive inflorescence that resembles an umbrella, consisting of multiple spikelets arranged in a spherical shape. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Schoenus umbellatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
