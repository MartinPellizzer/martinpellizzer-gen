    "intro": "Spartina alterniflora var. glabra, commonly known as smooth cordgrass, is a halophytic plant native to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America. It thrives in brackish and saltwater environments, particularly in tidal marshes and estuaries. This variety is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and its ability to tolerate periodic submersion and high salinity. Its rhizomes form dense mats that stabilize coastal soils and provide habitat for various wildlife species. Smooth cordgrass plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by filtering sediments and reducing erosion."
