It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in coastal areas and freshwater wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
