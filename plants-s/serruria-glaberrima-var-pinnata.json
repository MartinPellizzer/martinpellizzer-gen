It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in racemose inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
