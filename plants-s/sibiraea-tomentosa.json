    "intro": "Sibiraea tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly cinquefoil, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Sibiraea tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
