    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris var. columbiana, commonly known as the Columbian spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the western United States. It features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobila at the base of the leaves, which contain spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
