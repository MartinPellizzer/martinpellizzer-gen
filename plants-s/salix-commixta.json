    "intro": "Salix commixta, commonly known as the Chinese willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of wind pollination, and it flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Its flexible branches and rapid growth make it useful for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
