    "intro": "Sclerolaena muricata var. typica, commonly known as the roughleaf sclerolaena, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely branched stems and leaves that are rough to the touch due to the presence of stiff hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
