    "intro": "Synstemon, commonly known as the \"Coralroot,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Synstemon species are characterized by their lack of chlorophyll, making them dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. They produce small, colorful flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling coral in appearance. Due to their unique biology and limited distribution, many species of Synstemon are considered rare or endangered."
