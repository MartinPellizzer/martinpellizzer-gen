    "intro": "Senecio piurensis, commonly known as the Piura groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Peru. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 meters. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
