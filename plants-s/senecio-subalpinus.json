It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant features wiry stems and basal leaves, with yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and low nutrient conditions. Senecio subalpinus plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid environments."
