It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique white, fleshy fruits are a distinguishing feature, setting it apart from other sedum species."
