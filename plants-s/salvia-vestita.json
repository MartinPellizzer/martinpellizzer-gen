    "intro": "Salvia vestita, commonly known as common blue sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species. Salvia vestita is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
