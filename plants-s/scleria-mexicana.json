    "intro": "Scleria mexicana, commonly known as Mexican flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its stems are triangular in cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Scleria mexicana produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers."
