    "intro": "Smilax lucida, commonly known as the shining smilax, is a species of climbing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and spiny branches, which help it to climb and anchor itself to other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy coating that gives them a shiny appearance. Smilax lucida is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
