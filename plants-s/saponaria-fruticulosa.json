    "intro": "Saponaria fruticulosa, commonly known as the woolly betony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. Saponaria fruticulosa is also known for its mild saponin content, which can create a soapy lather when crushed."
