    "intro": "Sinarundinaria intermedia, commonly known as Chinese cliffbrake, is a fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori. Sinarundinaria intermedia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
