    "intro": "Sphaeropteris albifrons, commonly known as the white-frond cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its distinctive, pale green, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Sphaeropteris albifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
