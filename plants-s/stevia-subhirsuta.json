    "intro": "Stevia subhirsuta, commonly known as the hairy stevia, is a perennial shrub native to South America, specifically Brazil. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Stevia subhirsuta is valued for its sweet-tasting leaves, which contain high concentrations of steviol glycosides, natural sweeteners used in food and beverages. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates."
