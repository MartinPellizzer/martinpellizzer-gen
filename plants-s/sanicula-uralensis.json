    "intro": "Sanicula uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian cow-wheat, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that disperses seeds through wind. Sanicula uralensis is valued for its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
