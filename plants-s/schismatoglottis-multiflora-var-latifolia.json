    "intro": "Schismatoglottis multiflora var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved schismatoglottis, is a member of the Cyclanthaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps to reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant, though it requires careful attention to light and moisture levels."
