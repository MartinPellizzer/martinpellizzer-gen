    "intro": "Specklinia henrique-aragonii, commonly known as the Henrique-Aragonii Vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. It produces showy, long-lasting blooms that can reach up to 15 cm in length. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
