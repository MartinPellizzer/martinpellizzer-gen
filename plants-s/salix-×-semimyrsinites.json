    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 semimyrsinites, commonly known as the silver willow, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful form and seasonal foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. The bark of Salix \u00d7 semimyrsinites is smooth and may develop a grayish or reddish hue as the plant matures."
