    "intro": "Schefflera sandiana, commonly known as the Sand Island umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Guam. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage composed of large, glossy, dark green leaves arranged in a compact, umbrella-like pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. Schefflera sandiana is also valued for its ability to tolerate shade and its use in traditional medicine by the indigenous Chamorro people."
