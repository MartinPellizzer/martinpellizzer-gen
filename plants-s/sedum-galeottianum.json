It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
