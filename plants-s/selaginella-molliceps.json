It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, velvety coating, giving it its common name. Selaginella molliceps is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush appearance. Botanically, it is noted for its unique spore-producing structures and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
