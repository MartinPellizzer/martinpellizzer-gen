    "intro": "Sphaerothylax, commonly known as the globular cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their spherical or globose shape. The stems are usually ribbed and covered in spines, which help protect the plant from herbivores and reduce water loss. Sphaerothylax species produce small, colorful flowers that bloom in the spring or early summer. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid environments."
