It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has a compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
