    "intro": "Solanum donachui, commonly known as the Donachui nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its berries are edible when ripe but contain toxic alkaloids, making them dangerous if consumed in large quantities. Solanum donachui is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats at high elevations."
