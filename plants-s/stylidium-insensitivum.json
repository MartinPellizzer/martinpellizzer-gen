    "intro": "Stylidium insensitivum, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that fold together when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Stylidium insensitivum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf movement and attractive flowers."
