    "intro": "Scirpus triqueter var. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and pond margins. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed wetland habitats."
