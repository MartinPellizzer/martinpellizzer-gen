    "intro": "Spilanthes uliginosa, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows up to 30 centimeters tall, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom from late summer to early fall. Its most distinctive feature is its strong, pungent odor, which is often described as similar to garlic or rotting meat. Spilanthes uliginosa is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
