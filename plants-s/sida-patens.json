    "intro": "Sida patens, commonly known as seaside cotton or beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is an annual herb that thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Sida patens is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
