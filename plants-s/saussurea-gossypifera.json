It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces a fibrous, cotton-like substance in its flower heads, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional herbal practices."
