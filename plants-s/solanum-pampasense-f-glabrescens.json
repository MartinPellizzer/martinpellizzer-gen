    "intro": "Solanum pampasense f. glabrescens, commonly known as the Pampas nightshade, is a variant of the Pampas nightshade species native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, though the 'glabrescens' form exhibits reduced hair, giving it a smoother appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into berries, which are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption or cultivation."
