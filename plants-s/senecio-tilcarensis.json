    "intro": "Senecio tilcarensis, commonly known as the St. Helena groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. It has small, narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Senecio tilcarensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
