    "intro": "Saxifraga cespitosa subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in late summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Its ability to survive in harsh, cold climates makes it an important component of these ecosystems."
