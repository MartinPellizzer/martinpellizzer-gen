    "intro": "Sedum transbaikalense, commonly known as the Transbaikal stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to Siberia and parts of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in regions with cold climates."
