It features rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems topped with clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. Due to its rapid growth and medicinal properties, it has been historically used for healing and soil enrichment."
