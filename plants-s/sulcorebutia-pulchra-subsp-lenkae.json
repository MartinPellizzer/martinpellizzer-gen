    "intro": "Sulcorebutia pulchra subsp. lenkae, commonly known as the Lenka's fairy lantern, is a compact, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
