It features dense, fleshy rosettes of pale green to blue-gray leaves with a distinctive lemony aroma. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it a resilient and low-maintenance plant."
