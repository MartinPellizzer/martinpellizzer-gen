It features fleshy, upright stems that often branch into two, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance plant for gardeners."
