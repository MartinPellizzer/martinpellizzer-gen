    "intro": "Sebaea jasminiflora, commonly known as the yellow moonflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
