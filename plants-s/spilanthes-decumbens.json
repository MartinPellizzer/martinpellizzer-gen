    "intro": "Spilanthes decumbens, commonly known as the stinking roselily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Spilanthes decumbens is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the flowers are disturbed."
