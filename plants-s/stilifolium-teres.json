    "intro": "Stilifolium teres, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Stilifolium teres is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its graceful appearance and air-purifying properties."
