    "intro": "Seruneum paludosum, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich soils along the edges of ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that emerge from a central rhizome, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a slightly serrated edge, while it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus. Seruneum paludosum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
