The plant is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. Its flowers are catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated, and it produces small, triangular seeds. Salix furcata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
