    "intro": "Sedum oederi, commonly known as the stonecrop or ice plant, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, white, or red, typically in late summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Sedum oederi is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions."
