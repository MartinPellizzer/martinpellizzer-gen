    "intro": "Sedum telephium var. subalbidum, commonly known as the white stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and resilient addition to gardens."
