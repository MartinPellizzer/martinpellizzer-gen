    "intro": "Styphelia ruscifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Styphelia ruscifolia thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in native gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
