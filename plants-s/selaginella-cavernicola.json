    "intro": "Selaginella cavernicola, commonly known as the cave spikemoss, is a rare and ancient fern ally native to limestone caves in Mexico. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a unique ability to survive in low-light, humid environments. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are adapted for dispersal in cave ecosystems. Selaginella cavernicola is an important indicator species for cave biodiversity and ecological stability."
