    "intro": "Stevia cryptantha, commonly known as the lesser stevia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. While not as widely used as other stevia species for sweetening, it contains steviol glycosides, making it a potential source of natural sweeteners."
