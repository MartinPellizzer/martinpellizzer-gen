It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow leaves that appear early in the growing season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Its slender, weeping branches create a striking visual effect, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are lance-shaped and turn yellow in the autumn, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
