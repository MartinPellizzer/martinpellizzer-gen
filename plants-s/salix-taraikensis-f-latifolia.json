    "intro": "Salix taraikensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow, is a rare variant of the taraikensis willow native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer and wider than those of the typical species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
