    "intro": "Stellaria brachypetala var. alatavica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert margins. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in nutrient-poor, drought-prone habitats."
