    "intro": "Salvia pustulata, commonly known as the hummingbird sage, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly serrated. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Salvia pustulata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
