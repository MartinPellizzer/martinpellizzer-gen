    "intro": "Sisymbrium amphibium subsp. aquaticum, commonly known as water mustards, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with leaves that are alternate and often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruits are pods that split open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in regions with temperate climates."
