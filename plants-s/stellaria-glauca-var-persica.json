    "intro": "Stellaria glauca var. persica, commonly known as Persian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish or grayish hue due to the dense pubescence. This species is adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
