    "intro": "Saussurea jiulongensis, commonly known as the Jiulongshan saussurea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy composite flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Saussurea jiulongensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
