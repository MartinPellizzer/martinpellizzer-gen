    "intro": "Sonchus oleraceus var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular sowthistle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are surrounded by a series of bracts, forming a distinctive involucral structure. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in many regions."
