    "intro": "Serapias lingua f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf tongue orchid, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that resemble a tongue in shape. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces bright yellow or orange flowers in late spring. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
