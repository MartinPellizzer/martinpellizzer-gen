    "intro": "Schefflera buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtienii umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like arrangement of large, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are a food source for birds. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Schefflera buchtienii is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
