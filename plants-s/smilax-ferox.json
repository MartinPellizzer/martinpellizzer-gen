    "intro": "Smilax ferox, commonly known as the vicious smilax, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its stout, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. Smilax ferox is often found in moist, wooded areas and can be invasive in certain regions. Its robust growth and defensive spines make it a notable and sometimes problematic species in its native habitat."
