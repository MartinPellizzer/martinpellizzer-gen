    "intro": "Solanum melongena subsp. occidentale, commonly known as the West Indian eggplant, is a variant of the eggplant species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The flowers are usually yellow with a purple calyx, and the fruit is an egg-shaped, purple to black berry that ripens in late summer. This subspecies is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from the more commonly known Solanum melongena subsp. melongena."
