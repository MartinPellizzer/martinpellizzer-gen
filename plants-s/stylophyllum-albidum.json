    "intro": "Stylophyllum albidum, commonly known as the white sea fan, is a colonial cnidarian belonging to the order Pennatulacea. It is characterized by its branching, calcified skeleton that resembles a fan or brush, which provides structural support for its polyps. The polyps are typically white or pale in color and are responsible for capturing prey in the water. This species is found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, often growing on rocky substrates. Its botanical features are closely tied to its marine environment, making it an important part of reef ecosystems."
