    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 quercifolia, commonly known as the Oregon grape willow, is a hybrid deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of the Oregon grape, hence its common name. The plant typically grows along streambanks and moist soils, showcasing its adaptability to riparian environments. It produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark berries that are edible for some bird species. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in wetland restoration projects."
