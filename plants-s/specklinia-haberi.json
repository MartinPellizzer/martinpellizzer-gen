    "intro": "Specklinia haberi, commonly known as the Haber's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its small, intricate leaves and clusters of pale green to yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Specklinia haberi is considered vulnerable and is often sought after in the horticultural trade."
