    "intro": "Saussurea microcephala var. pteroclada, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and compact, bushy growth habit. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This variant is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance in its native habitat."
