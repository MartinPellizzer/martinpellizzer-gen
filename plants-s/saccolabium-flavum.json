    "intro": "Saccolabium flavum, commonly known as the yellow saccolabium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. Saccolabium flavum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its drought tolerance."
