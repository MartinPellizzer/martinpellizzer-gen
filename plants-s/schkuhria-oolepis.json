It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear a single flower at the apex. Schkuhria oolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
