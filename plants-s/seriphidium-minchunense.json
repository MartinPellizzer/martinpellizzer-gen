    "intro": "Seriphidium minchunense, commonly known as the Minchun wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is typically shrub-like, with silver-green leaves covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its resilience and ecological role, it is often found in rocky soils and semi-desert habitats."
