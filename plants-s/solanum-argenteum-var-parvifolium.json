    "intro": "Solanum argenteum var. parvifolium, commonly known as silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine hairs, and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, inedible berries that turn red when mature. Due to its ornamental value and potential toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling."
