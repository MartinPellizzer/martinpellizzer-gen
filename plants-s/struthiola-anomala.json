    "intro": "Struthiola anomala, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Struthiola anomala is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems."
