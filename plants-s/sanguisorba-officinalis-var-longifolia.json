    "intro": "Sanguisorba officinalis var. longifolia, commonly known as long-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late summer, which are borne on elongated inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands."
