    "intro": "Salix pentandra var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
