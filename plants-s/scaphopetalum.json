    "intro": "Scaphopetalum, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in southern Africa. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Scaphopetalum species typically have succulent leaves and stems, which help them conserve water in their harsh environments. These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
