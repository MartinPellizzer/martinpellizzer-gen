    "intro": "Sida angustifolia var. major, commonly known as the narrowleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments. Sida angustifolia var. major is also known for its role in supporting local pollinators and its potential ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
