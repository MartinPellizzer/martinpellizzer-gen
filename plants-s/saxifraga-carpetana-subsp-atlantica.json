    "intro": "Saxifraga carpetana subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles and western Europe. It thrives in rocky, maritime environments, often found on cliffs and coastal heaths. The plant features dark green, succulent leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and typically appear in clusters during the summer months. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates."
