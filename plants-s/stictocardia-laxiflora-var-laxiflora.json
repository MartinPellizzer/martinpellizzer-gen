    "intro": "Stictocardia laxiflora var. laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered stictocardia, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a compact growth habit with a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in loose, organic soils. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in temperate regions of Asia."
