    "intro": "Stelestylis anomala, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red petals and sepals, which stand out against its green foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by bees and other insects. Stelestylis anomala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
