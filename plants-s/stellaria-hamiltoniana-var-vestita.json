    "intro": "Stellaria hamiltoniana var. vestita, commonly known as the silver starwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, white flowers that are arranged in star-like clusters, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy, silver-tomentose leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine settings."
