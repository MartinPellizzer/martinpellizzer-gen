    "intro": "Statice glomerata, commonly known as sea lavender, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically bluish-green, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Statice glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in dried flower arrangements."
