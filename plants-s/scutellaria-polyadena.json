    "intro": "Scutellaria polyadena, commonly known as bluebeard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces striking, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers have a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the mint family, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Scutellaria polyadena is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
