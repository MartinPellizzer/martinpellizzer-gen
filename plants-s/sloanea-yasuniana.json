    "intro": "Sloanea yasuniana, commonly known as the Yasun\u00ed sloanea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest in Ecuador. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Sloanea yasuniana is adapted to the humid, shaded understory of the rainforest and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
