    "intro": "Saponaria sicula subsp. stranjensis, commonly known as the Sicilian soapwort, is a perennial herb native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, erect stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its name derives from the presence of saponin compounds, which produce a soap-like lather when crushed."
