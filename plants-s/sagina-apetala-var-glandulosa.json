    "intro": "Sagina apetala var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, prostrate stems covered with small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are often glandular-dotted, giving it a slightly sticky texture. This species thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
