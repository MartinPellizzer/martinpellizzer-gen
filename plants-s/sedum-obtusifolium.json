    "intro": "Sedum obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in North America. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically oval or bluntly pointed, which help it store water and survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. It is often found growing on cliffs, slopes, and in sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
