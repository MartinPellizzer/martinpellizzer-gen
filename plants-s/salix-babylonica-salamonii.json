It is characterized by its cascading branches that hang like delicate curtains, giving it a graceful and ornamental appearance. The plant produces catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal beauty. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist environments."
