    "intro": "Selaginella rupestris subvar. glaucina, commonly known as the blue spruce moss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern-like plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It features delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, giving it a striking appearance. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it retain moisture. It is often found in crevices of cliffs or on rocky slopes where it can thrive with minimal water. Its unique morphology and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
