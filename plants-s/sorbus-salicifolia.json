    "intro": "Sorbus salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, willow-like leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which give way to orange-red berries in the fall. Its bark is often fissured and becomes smoother with age, and it is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Sorbus salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
