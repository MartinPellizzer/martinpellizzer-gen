    "intro": "Selaginella excurrens, commonly known as the running spike moss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit. It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella excurrens is a vascular plant with a sporophyte-dominated life cycle, and it exhibits a unique ability to survive in arid conditions through dormancy. Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
