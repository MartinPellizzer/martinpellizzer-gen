It is characterized by its large, elongated, and often heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, oblong fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of tropical flora and ecological diversity."
