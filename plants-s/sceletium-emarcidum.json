It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive in dry conditions. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its unique appearance and historical use by indigenous peoples, it is of interest to botanists and ethnobotrists alike."
