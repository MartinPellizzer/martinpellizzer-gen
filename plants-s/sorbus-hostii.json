    "intro": "Sorbus hostii, commonly known as the Hirtz's whitebeams, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Sorbus hostii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
