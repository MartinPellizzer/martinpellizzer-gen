    "intro": "Salix atrocinerea f. codinae, commonly known as the black willow subgroup codinae, is a rare and unique form of the black willow. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This subspecies is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its botanical features include a slender stem and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and botanical study."
