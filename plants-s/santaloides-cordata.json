    "intro": "Santaloides cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Santaloides cordata is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and incense."
