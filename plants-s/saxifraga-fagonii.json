    "intro": "Saxifraga fagonii, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette shape, and are covered in a fine layer of white wax. Saxifraga fagonii is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures, making it a common sight in alpine meadows."
