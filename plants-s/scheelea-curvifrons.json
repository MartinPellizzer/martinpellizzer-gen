    "intro": "Scheelea curvifrons, commonly known as the curved-beak fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often curved fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and have a leathery texture, with small, scale-like structures along the margins. Scheelea curvifrons is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
