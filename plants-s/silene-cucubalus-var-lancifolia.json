    "intro": "Silene cucubalus var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved campion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fleshy, succulent leaves and stems help it retain moisture in dry environments. The species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
