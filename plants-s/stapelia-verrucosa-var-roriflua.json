    "intro": "Stapelia verrucosa var. roriflua, commonly known as the\u75a3\u72b6 stapelia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces striking, waxy flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. This variant is prized for its unique appearance and resilience in dry conditions."
