    "intro": "Schoenorchis tortifolia, commonly known as the tortile orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique, twisted leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its conservation status is critical due to habitat loss and over-collection. Botanically, it belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships that aid in nutrient uptake."
