    "intro": "Selaginella papillosa, commonly known as the mossy spikemoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a moss-like appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Selaginella papillosa reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and it has a unique ability to survive desiccation, making it a resilient species. Its structure includes both stems and leaves, with the leaves arranged in whorls around the stem."
