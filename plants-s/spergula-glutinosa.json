    "intro": "Spergula glutinosa, commonly known as sticky wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability and rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
