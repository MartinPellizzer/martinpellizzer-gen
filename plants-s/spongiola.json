    "intro": "Spongiola, commonly known as the sponge moss, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, moss-like appearance and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive structure with a central stem and leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. Spongiola lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting microfauna in its habitat."
