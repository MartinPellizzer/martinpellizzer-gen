    "intro": "Smilacina robusta, commonly known as common greenbrier, is a woody vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Smilacina robusta is characterized by its thorny stems and is often found climbing over other vegetation."
