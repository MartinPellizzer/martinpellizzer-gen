    "intro": "Stylidium bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like sunburst, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that open in response to light. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, leaf-like structures that resemble moss, hence its common name. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Stylidium bryoides is a short-lived annual plant that plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local insect populations."
