    "intro": "Sambucus columnaris, commonly known as the upright elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces dark purple berries in the fall, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Sambucus columnaris thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
