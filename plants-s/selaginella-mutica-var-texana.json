    "intro": "Selaginella mutica var. texana, commonly known as the Texas spikemoss, is a low-growing, evergreen fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
