    "intro": "Sida chachapoyensis, commonly known as the Chachapoya cotton or Chachapoya flower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive central disc. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique appearance and cultural significance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
