    "intro": "Schultesia obolarioides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed schultesia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its floral structure features five petals and a prominent, lobed calyx, which are key botanical traits for identification."
