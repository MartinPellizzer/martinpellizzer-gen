    "intro": "Stelis tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, delicate orchid flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic substrates. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts and botanical gardens."
