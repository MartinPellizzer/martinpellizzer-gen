    "intro": "Solanum subauriferum, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has hairy, glandular leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, round berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. Solanum subauriferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
