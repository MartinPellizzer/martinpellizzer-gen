    "intro": "Solanum stolzii, commonly known as the Stolz's nightshade, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or purple. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its poisonous nature."
