    "intro": "Saxifraga gracillima, commonly known as the slender saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces delicate, white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Saxifraga gracillima plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is a characteristic species of tundra ecosystems."
