    "intro": "Scirpus pachystylus, commonly known as the broad-stemmed bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers at the top of its stems, typically in late summer. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize wetland soils and prevent erosion. Scirpus pachystylus is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other moist environments."
