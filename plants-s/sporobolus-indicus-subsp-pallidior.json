    "intro": "Sporobolus indicus subsp. pallidior, commonly known as the pale sandreed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
