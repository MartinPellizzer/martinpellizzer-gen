    "intro": "Sorghum vulgare var. rubens, commonly known as red sorghum, is a variant of the sorghum species native to Africa. It is characterized by its striking red pigmentation, which is primarily due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments in its stems and leaves. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as for its use in traditional foods and animal feed. The plant is a tall, grass-like perennial that can grow up to 3 meters in height. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and sturdy, branched stalks that produce small, fluffy flowers."
