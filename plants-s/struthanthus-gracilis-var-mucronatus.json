    "intro": "Struthanthus gracilis var. mucronatus, commonly known as the slender starflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is noted for its low-growing habit and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
