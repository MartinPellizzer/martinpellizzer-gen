    "intro": "Stipa arnowiae, commonly known as the Arnow's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, fluffy panicles that produce light, airy seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Stipa arnowiae plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying alpine flora."
