    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 irreflexa, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically light green and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks through its extensive root system."
