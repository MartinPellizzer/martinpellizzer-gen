    "intro": "Schotia latifolia, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white bark and dense, rounded crown of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and windy conditions. Schotia latifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
