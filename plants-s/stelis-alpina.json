    "intro": "Stelis alpina, commonly known as the alpine stelis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in cool, moist environments. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers. Its growth habit and habitat make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine zones. Stelis alpina is often found in cloud forests and is a symbol of the unique biodiversity of mountainous regions."
