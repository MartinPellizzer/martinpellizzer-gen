    "intro": "Scytalis helicopus var. major, commonly known as the spiral grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which form a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
