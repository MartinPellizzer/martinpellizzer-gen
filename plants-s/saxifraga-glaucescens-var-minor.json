    "intro": "Saxifraga glaucescens var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it can withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its compact form and ornamental flowers, it is cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
