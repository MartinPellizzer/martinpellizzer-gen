It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to pink flower heads that resemble small coneflowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Senecio spartareus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
