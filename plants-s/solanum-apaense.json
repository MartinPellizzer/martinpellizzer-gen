It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant is characterized by its small, purple or white flowers and its berries, which are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Solanum apaense is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the nightshade family."
