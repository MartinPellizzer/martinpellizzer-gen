    "intro": "Stipa epilosa, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Stipa epilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
