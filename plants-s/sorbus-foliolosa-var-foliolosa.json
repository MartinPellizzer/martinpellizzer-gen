    "intro": "Sorbus foliolosa var. foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountains of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
