It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, club-shaped sporophylls that produce spores. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
