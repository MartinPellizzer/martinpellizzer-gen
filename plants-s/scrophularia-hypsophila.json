    "intro": "Scrophularia hypsophila, commonly known as the alpine scrophularia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat. Scrophularia hypsophila is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
