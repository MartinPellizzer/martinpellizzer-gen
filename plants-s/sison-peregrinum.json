    "intro": "Sison peregrinum, commonly known as the wandering sison, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, opposite leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
