    "intro": "Schefflera pachycephala, commonly known as the thick-headed umbrella plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like crown of large, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Schefflera pachycephala is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
