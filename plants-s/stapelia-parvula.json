    "intro": "Stapelia parvula, commonly known as the miniature star plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, resembling the appearance of a star. These flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Stapelia parvula is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions."
