    "intro": "Scleranthus marginatus, commonly known as the coastal thornweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, usually pink or white flowers. The plant has hairy leaves and is often found growing in disturbed soils along coastal areas and roadsides. Its seed capsules dehisce to release seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Scleranthus marginatus is adapted to salty and windy environments, making it a common sight in maritime climates."
