    "intro": "Stenochlaena abrupta, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or soil substrates. Stenochlaena abrupta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
