    "intro": "Salix \u00d7 neoburgensis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a hybrid species of willow that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue on the upper surface and a lighter green underside. It produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, during the spring season. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds."
