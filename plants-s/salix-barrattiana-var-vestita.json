    "intro": "Salix barrattiana var. vestita, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are male and female flowers arranged in separate clusters. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a fragrant, resinous scent. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest edges."
