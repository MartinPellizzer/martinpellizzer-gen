    "intro": "Santalum lanaiense, commonly known as the Lanai sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within mesic forests. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, heartwood that is highly valued for its aromatic properties. It has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fleshy, red berries. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Santalum lanaiense is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
