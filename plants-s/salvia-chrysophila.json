    "intro": "Salvia chrysophila, commonly known as golden sage, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Salvia chrysophila is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
