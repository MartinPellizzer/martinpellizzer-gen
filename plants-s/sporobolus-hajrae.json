    "intro": "Sporobolus hajrae, commonly known as the Hajra grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates. Sporobolus hajrae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
