    "intro": "Scirpus hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. The plant is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Scirpus hispidulus typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense stands that provide habitat for various wildlife species. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination."
