    "intro": "Selaginella sambiranensis, commonly known as the Sambiranensis spikemoss, is a rare and endangered vascular plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves and small, spore-bearing structures called strobila. This plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, producing both microspores and megaspores on the same plant, a trait known as heterosporous reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where humidity is high. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
