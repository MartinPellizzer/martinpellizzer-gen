    "intro": "Stenanthera localis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, intricate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
