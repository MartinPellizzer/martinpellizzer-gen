It is a hybrid between Salix alba and Salix triandra, characterized by its weeping habit and long, cascading branches. The plant produces small, greenish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist soils and is often planted near water bodies for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
