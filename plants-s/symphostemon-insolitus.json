    "intro": "Symphostemon insolitus, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Native to the misty cloud forests of southern Mexico, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree bark without parasitizing its host. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Symphostemon insolitus is considered an endangered species."
