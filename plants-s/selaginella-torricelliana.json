    "intro": "Selaginella torricelliana, commonly known as the spikemoss, is a member of the Selaginellaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology and reproductive structures. It is a vascular plant that exhibits a primitive form of vascular tissue, distinguishing it from non-vascular mosses. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are spirally arranged and possess a distinct midrib, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Selaginella torricelliana reproduces via spores, with sporophytes producing spore capsules that are often clustered in dense, spike-like structures."
