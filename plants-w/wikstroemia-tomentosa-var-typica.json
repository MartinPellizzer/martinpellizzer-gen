    "intro": "Wikstroemia tomentosa var. typica, commonly known as the woolly waxtree, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a slightly aromatic scent. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, sunny soils."
