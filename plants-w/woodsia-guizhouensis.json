It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
