    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf woodsia, is a compact fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its short, upright rhizomes and densely packed, ovate to lanceolate fronds. The fronds are typically dark green, with a smooth texture and a slightly curled appearance. This fern thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its small size and dense growth habit make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
