    "intro": "Wendlandiella polyclada, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with numerous small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has fibrous roots and stems that spread horizontally, often rooting at the nodes to form dense colonies. Its leaves are lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Wendlandiella polyclada is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
