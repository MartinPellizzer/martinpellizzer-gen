    "intro": "Wikstroemia mononectaria, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal sand dunes and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in Hawaii."
