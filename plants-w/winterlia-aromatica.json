    "intro": "Winterlia aromatica, commonly known as the fragrant winter lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It features delicate, aromatic flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before many other plants. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are typically upright and branched. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The essential oils derived from its flowers are valued for their aromatic properties in perfumery and herbal medicine."
