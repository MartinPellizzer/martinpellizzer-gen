    "intro": "White-sloanea migiurtina, commonly known as the white sloanea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. White-sloanea migiurtina is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
