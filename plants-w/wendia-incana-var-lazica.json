    "intro": "Wendia incana var. lazica, commonly known as the Lazica hairvetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and along roadsides. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil, and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the plant produces small, dry pods that contain several seeds."
