    "intro": "Woodwardia harlandii var. takeoi, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf shield fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
