    "intro": "Woodsia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan woodsia, is a fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Woodsia guatemalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
