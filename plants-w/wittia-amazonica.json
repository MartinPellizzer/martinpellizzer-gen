It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, rushes, and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Wittia amazonica is adapted to the humid, nutrient-rich conditions of the Amazon basin."
