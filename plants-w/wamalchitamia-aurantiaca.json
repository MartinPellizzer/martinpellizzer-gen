It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically arranged in spikes and bloom during the wet season. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its native habitat."
