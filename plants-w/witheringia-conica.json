    "intro": "Witheringia conica, commonly known as the conical bellflower, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often appearing in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Witheringia conica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
