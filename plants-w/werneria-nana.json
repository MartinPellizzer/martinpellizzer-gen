    "intro": "Werneria nana, commonly known as the dwarf werneria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring dense, compact foliage with dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value lies in its compact size and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Werneria nana is often used in horticulture for ground cover or as a decorative plant in shaded garden settings."
