    "intro": "Withania novo-friburgensis, commonly known as the Friburg ghostflower, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, white, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and exhibits a semi-succulent growth form. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
