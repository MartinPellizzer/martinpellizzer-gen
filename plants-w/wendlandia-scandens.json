    "intro": "Wendlandia scandens, commonly known as the red-hot catwhiskers, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, red bracts that resemble cat whiskers. The plant is a trailing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. Its flowers are small and yellow, contrasting with the vibrant red bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
