    "intro": "Woodsia bellii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Woodsia bellii is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
