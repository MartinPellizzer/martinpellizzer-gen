    "intro": "Wormia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan wormia, is a small, delicate moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and pale green to yellowish-green foliage. The plant has a low-growing, cushion-like structure with closely packed leaves that are often twisted or curled. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and consistent moisture. Wormia papuana plays a minor but important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
