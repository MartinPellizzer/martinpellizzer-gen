    "intro": "Woodsia caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian woodsia, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or loamy soils. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
