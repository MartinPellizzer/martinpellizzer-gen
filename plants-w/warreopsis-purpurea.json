It is characterized by its striking purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
