    "intro": "Wisteria multijuga var. rosea, commonly known as the pink Japanese wisteria, is a flowering vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, pinkish-lavender flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its vigorous growth, it is often trained on trellises or arbors for ornamental display."
