    "intro": "Waitzia striata, commonly known as the striped lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow thallus with prominent, parallel striations that give it its common name. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic nutrients, while the fungal component offers structural support and protection. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
