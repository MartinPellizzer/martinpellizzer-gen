    "intro": "Wedelia humilis, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Wedelia humilis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
