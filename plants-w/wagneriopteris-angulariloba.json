    "intro": "Wagneriopteris angulariloba, commonly known as the angular-lobed fern, is a prehistoric plant belonging to the order Psilophytales. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds with angular lobes, which suggest a complex vascular system. Fossil records indicate that it thrived during the late Silurian to early Devonian periods. The plant's structure suggests it was a primitive vascular plant with specialized tissues for water transport. Its morphology provides important insights into the early evolution of land plants."
