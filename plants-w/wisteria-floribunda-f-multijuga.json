    "intro": "Wisteria floribunda f. multijuga, commonly known as the Japanese wisteria, is a climbing vine characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. It originates from Japan and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The plant has compound leaves with pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and produces woody seed pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often requiring a support structure to climb. This variety is closely related to other wisteria species but is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and earlier flowering."
