    "intro": "Warczewiczella gibeziae, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
