    "intro": "Woodsia lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland woodsia, is a small, evergreen fern native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated edge, and its spore-producing structures are clustered at the base of the fronds. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold climates and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in nutrient-poor soils."
