    "intro": "Werneria lycopodioides, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a small evergreen herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Huperoniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit with dense, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the study of ancient plant lineages."
