    "intro": "Wormia apetala, commonly known as the naked liverwort, is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures that lack true stems and roots, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern and are often covered in a thick layer of moss-like tissue. Wormia apetala is found in various regions, including North America and parts of Asia, where it grows on rocks and soil. Due to its small size and lack of showy flowers, it is often overlooked but plays a role in soil stabilization and microhabitat creation."
