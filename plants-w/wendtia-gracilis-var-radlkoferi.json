    "intro": "Wendtia gracilis var. radlkoferi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by small, round, green fruits. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
