    "intro": "Westringia dampieri, commonly known as the coastal westringia, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy, often with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers in winter, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to withstand salt spray make it a popular choice for seaside landscaping."
