    "intro": "Werauhia vulcanicola, commonly known as the Volcanic Werauhia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
