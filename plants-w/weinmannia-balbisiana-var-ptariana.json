    "intro": "Weinmannia balbisiana var. ptariana, commonly known as the coastal weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
