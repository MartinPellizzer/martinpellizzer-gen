    "intro": "Weinmannia ovalis var. roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima Weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high elevations, often growing on rocky or nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
