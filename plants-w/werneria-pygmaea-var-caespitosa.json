    "intro": "Werneria pygmaea var. caespitosa, commonly known as the dwarf werneria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a dense, grass-like rosette. The plant produces tiny, pale green or yellowish flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its compact size and dense growth habit make it an attractive addition to bog gardens and water feature landscapes."
