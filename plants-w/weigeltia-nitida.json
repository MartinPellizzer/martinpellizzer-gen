    "intro": "Weigeltia nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf weigeltia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in hedges or as a specimen plant in gardens. Weigeltia nitida is relatively low maintenance and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
