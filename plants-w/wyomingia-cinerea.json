    "intro": "Wyomingia cinerea, commonly known as the gray sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Wyomingia cinerea is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures makes it an important component of its native habitat."
