    "intro": "Westoniella chirripoensis, commonly known as the Chirripo pittosporum, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Pittosporaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in the moist, cool climate of the montane regions. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
