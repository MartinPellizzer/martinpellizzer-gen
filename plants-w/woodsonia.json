    "intro": "Woodsonia, commonly known as the woodsonia fern, is a type of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a fan shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodsonia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
