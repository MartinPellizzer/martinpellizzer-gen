    "intro": "Wurmbea stellata, commonly known as the star-shaped arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in a raceme. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its natural habitat. Wurmbea stellata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks."
