It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Caribbean. This herbaceous plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the axils of the leaves and are often borne in clusters. Werauhia attenuata is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
