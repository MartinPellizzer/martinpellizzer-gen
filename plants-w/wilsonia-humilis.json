    "intro": "Wilsonia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in rocky or degraded habitats. Wilsonia humilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
