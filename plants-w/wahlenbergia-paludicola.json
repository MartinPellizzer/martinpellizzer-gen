    "intro": "Wahlenbergia paludicola, commonly known as the marsh bluebell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, sometimes prostrate stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in wet or marshy habitats, often found in coastal or inland areas with high moisture levels. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Wahlenbergia paludicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native environment."
