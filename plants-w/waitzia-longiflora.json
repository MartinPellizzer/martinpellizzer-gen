It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are finely divided and arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant species for ecological studies."
