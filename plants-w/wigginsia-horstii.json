    "intro": "Wigginsia horstii, commonly known as the Horstii cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stem, which is often covered in a layer of white, waxy material that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green stem. Wigginsia horstii is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access underground water sources. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
