    "intro": "Wigginsia langsdorfii subsp. multiceps, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features dense, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
