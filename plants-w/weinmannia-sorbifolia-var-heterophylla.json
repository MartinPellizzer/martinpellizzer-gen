    "intro": "Weinmannia sorbifolia var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf weinmannia, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which varies in shape and size across different parts of the plant, giving it its varietal name. The leaves are typically alternate, with some being narrow and others broader, often with a waxy surface. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
