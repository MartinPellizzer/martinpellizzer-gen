    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa var. plummerae, commonly known as the plummer's wood sorrel, is a rare fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
