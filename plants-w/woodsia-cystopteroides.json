    "intro": "Woodsia cystopteroides, commonly known as the dwarf wood fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and finely divided, dark green fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family. Woodsia cystopteroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and shaded borders."
