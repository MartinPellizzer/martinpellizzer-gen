    "intro": "Werauhia breedloveana, commonly known as the Breddlove's werauhia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage is often covered in fine trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Werauhia breedloveana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
