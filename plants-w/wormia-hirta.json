    "intro": "Wormia hirta, commonly known as the hairy worm plant, is a small, succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and often shed during drought periods to conserve moisture. Wormia hirta is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its specialized morphology and water-storing tissues."
