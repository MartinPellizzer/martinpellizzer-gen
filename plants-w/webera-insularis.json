    "intro": "Webera insularis, commonly known as the Island Webera, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on certain islands in the Indo-Pacific region. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species."
