    "intro": "Wiborgia leptoptera subsp. leptoptera, commonly known as the slender-leaved wiborgia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
