It is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils on exposed coastal areas and cliffs. It is known for its aromatic wood, which was historically used by Native Hawaiians for various purposes. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
