    "intro": "Weinmannia arguta, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Weinmannia arguta is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
