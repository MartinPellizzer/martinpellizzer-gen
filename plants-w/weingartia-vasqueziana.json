    "intro": "Weingartia vasqueziana, commonly known as the Vasquezian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spine-tipped areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments with well-draining soil. Weingartia vasqueziana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
