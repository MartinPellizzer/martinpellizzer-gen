    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf wood sorrel, is a low-growing fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. This variety is notable for its compact size and ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
