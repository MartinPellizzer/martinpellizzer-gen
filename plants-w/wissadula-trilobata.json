    "intro": "Wissadula trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
