    "intro": "Wikstroemia symplocoides, commonly known as the silverleaf beargrass, is a shrub native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered with a fine layer of wax, contributing to its drought tolerance. Wikstroemia symplocoides is often found in coastal and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
