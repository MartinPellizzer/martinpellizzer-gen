    "intro": "Weinmannia elattantha, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its bark is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Weinmannia elattantha is adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
