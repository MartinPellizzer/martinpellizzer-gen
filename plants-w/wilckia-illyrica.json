    "intro": "Wilckia illyrica, commonly known as the Illlyric Wilckia, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a unique, almost ethereal appearance that has made it a subject of botanical interest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wilckia illyrica is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
