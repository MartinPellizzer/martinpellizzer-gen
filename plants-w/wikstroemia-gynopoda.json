It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mesic forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
