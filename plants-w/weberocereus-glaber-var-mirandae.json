    "intro": "Weberocereus glaber var. mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda's moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it produces a fruit that is edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
