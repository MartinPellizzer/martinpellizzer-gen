    "intro": "Werauhia pycnantha, commonly known as the clustered werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and sword-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Werauhia pycnantha is often found growing on tree trunks or branches, where it derives nutrients from rainwater and debris accumulating in its leaf rosette."
