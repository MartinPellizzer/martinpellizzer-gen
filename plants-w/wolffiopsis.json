    "intro": "Wolffiopsis, commonly known as the false dodder, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some of their nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Wolffiopsis species typically have small, yellow or green flowers and are often found growing on other plants in open habitats. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are characterized by their thin, wiry stems and reduced leaves. Due to their parasitic nature, they can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of their host plants."
