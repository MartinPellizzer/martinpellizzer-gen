    "intro": "Wolffia australiana, commonly known as water moss, is a member of the duckweed family (Lemnaceae). It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in size. This aquatic plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the surface of ponds and lakes. Wolffia australiana reproduces rapidly through vegetative propagation, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Its simple structure and high reproductive rate make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
