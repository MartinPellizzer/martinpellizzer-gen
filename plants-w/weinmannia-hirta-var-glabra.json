    "intro": "Weinmannia hirta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
