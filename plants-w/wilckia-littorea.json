    "intro": "Wilckia littorea, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a tropical flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often with a prominent central boss. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, adapted to withstand salty sea air. Wilckia littorea thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline, making it a common sight in coastal gardens. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it a resilient and ornamental species in maritime environments."
