    "intro": "Weberocereus glaber subsp. mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda's moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, globular shape and pale green to white stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many Socotran cacti. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to the arid, rocky environment of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
