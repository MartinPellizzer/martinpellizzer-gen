It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
