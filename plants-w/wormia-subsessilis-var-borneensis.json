    "intro": "Wormia subsessilis var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean worm fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern. This variety is noted for its unique morphology and ecological significance in the biodiversity of Borneo's rainforest ecosystems."
