    "intro": "Westringia rigida f. gracilior, commonly known as the slender westringia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its dense growth habit. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
