    "intro": "Walcuffa, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, often pink or red, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its stems can store water, allowing it to thrive in conditions where other plants would perish. Walcuffa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
