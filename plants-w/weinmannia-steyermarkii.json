    "intro": "Weinmannia steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Weinmanniaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leaves that are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
