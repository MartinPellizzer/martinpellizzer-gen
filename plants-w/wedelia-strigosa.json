    "intro": "Wedelia strigosa, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Wedelia strigosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and coastal environments."
