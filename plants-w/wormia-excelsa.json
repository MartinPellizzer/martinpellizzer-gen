    "intro": "Wormia excelsa, commonly known as the giant worm fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the order Psilotales. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and the absence of true leaves, stems, or roots, making it a primitive vascular plant. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, brush-like clusters along its stems. Wormia excelsa thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of great interest to botanists studying early plant evolution."
