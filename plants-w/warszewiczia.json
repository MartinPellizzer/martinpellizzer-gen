    "intro": "Warszewiczia, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are characterized by their small, often yellow or white flowers and their ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. They have a woody structure with small, narrow leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits. Warszewiczia species are adapted to sandy soils and are often used in traditional medicine in their native regions."
