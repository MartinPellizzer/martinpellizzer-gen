    "intro": "Woodsiopsis cystopteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodsiopsis, is a small, herbaceous fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Woodsiopsis cystopteroides prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
