    "intro": "Wormia luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon worm fern, is a small, terrestrial fern endemic to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance. The plant has small, closely spaced leaves that form a dense mat, often growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments. It is notable for its ability to thrive in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
