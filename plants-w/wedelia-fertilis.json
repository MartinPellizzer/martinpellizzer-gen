    "intro": "Wedelia fertilis, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with spreading stems that often form a dense mat. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Wedelia fertilis is often used in horticulture for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature."
