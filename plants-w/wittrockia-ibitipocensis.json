    "intro": "Wittrockia ibitipocensis, commonly known as the Ibitipoca cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically green when immature and turn reddish-brown when mature. Wittrockia ibitipocensis is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
