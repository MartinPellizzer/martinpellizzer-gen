    "intro": "Wolffiella oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf wolfia, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is characterized by its simple, floating leaves that are elongated and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through vegetative propagation. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, it can play a significant role in aquatic ecosystems."
