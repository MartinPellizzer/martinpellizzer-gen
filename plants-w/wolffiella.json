    "intro": "Wolffiella, commonly known as the bluebell or false bluebell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. The plants are typically herbaceous, with showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple. They often grow in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to cold and high-altitude conditions. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to the plant's distinctive appearance."
