    "intro": "Weinmannia silvatica var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western silverscale tree, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like structures that reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces distinctive, woody fruits that contain seeds. The species is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its adaptation to coastal climates."
