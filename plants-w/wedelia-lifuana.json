    "intro": "Wedelia lifuana, commonly known as the New Guinea carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, adding a delicate floral display. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Wedelia lifuana is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to cover ground and its attractive appearance."
