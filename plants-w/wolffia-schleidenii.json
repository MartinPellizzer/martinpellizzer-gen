    "intro": "Wolffia schleidenii, commonly known as the water moss or duckweed, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant has a simple morphology, consisting of a floating leaf-like structure with a single node and a root-like structure at the base. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the latter being the dominant method, allowing for rapid population growth in suitable water conditions. Wolffia schleidenii thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and rice paddies."
