    "intro": "Wangia saccopetaloides, commonly known as the saccopetalum orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, white to pale pink flowers with a sac-like structure at the base of each bloom. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces fibrous, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Wangia saccopetaloides is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic matter in its soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
