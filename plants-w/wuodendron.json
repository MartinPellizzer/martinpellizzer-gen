    "intro": "Wuodendron, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-white foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and emit a mild, aromatic scent when crushed. Wuodendron flowers in early spring, producing clusters of small, pale yellow blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
