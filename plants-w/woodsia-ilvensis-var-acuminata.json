    "intro": "Woodsia ilvensis var. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminata wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with finely toothed margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clustered, stalked sorus structures on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
