    "intro": "Woodiellantha grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered woodiellantha, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. These flowers bloom during the warmer months and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
