    "intro": "Wedelia paludosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh heliotrope, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks."
