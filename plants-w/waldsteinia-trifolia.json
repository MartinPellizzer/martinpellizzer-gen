    "intro": "Waldsteinia trifolia, commonly known as white vernal grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, white flowers in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its ability to colonize disturbed sites. Waldsteinia trifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
