    "intro": "Woodsia pseudoilvensis, commonly known as the false wood sorrel, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, often growing in association with other ferns and mosses. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of the fern family. The botanical features of Woodsia pseudoilvensis make it an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
