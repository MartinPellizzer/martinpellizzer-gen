    "intro": "Willoughbya attenuata, commonly known as the slender willow-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and feather-like, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive, plant-like appearance. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
