    "intro": "Woodwardia harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
