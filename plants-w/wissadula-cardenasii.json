    "intro": "Wissadula cardenasii, commonly known as the Mexican star cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
