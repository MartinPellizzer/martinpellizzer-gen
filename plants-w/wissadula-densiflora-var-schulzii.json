    "intro": "Wissadula densiflora var. schulzii, commonly known as the Schultze's dense-flowered pachypodium, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the dry season, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in many desert plants. This variant is closely related to other species in the Pachypodium genus, sharing similar adaptations to drought and heat."
