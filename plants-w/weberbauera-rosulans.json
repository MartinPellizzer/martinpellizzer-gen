    "intro": "Weberbauera rosulans, commonly known as the Rosulate Weberbauera, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of pink or white, and bloom during the wet season. Weberbauera rosulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
