    "intro": "Willughbeia, commonly known as the \"Papua sandpaper tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. These plants are characterized by their woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, sandpapery texture. Willughbeia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The genus is notable for its ecological importance in tropical rainforests and its potential use in traditional medicine."
