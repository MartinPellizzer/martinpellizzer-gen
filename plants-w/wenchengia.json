    "intro": "Wenchengia, commonly known as the \"Evergreen Orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, these plants are characterized by their elegant, evergreen foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically broad and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern, while the flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of white, pink, or yellow. Wenchengia species are prized for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for their beauty and fragrance. They thrive in cool, humid environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
