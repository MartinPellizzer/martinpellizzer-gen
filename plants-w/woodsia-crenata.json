    "intro": "Woodsia crenata, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, thriving in rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
