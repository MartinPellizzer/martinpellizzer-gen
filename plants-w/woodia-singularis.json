    "intro": "Woodia singularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Woodia singularis thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable addition to native plant gardens."
