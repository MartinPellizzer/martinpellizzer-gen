    "intro": "Wedelia calycina var. asperrima, commonly known as the roughleaf wedelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough, hairy surface that gives the plant its common name. Small, white to pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters at the leaf axils, typically blooming during the warm season. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in moist environments."
