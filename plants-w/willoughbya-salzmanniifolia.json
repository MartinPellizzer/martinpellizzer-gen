    "intro": "Willoughbya salzmanniifolia, commonly known as the Salzmann's willoughbya, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped inflorescences that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract various pollinators. It is a member of the Araceae family, known for its showy, often colorful flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
