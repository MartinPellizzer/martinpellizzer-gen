It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Widjajachloa is valued for its strong, fibrous leaves, which have been traditionally used by M\u0101ori for weaving and crafting.
