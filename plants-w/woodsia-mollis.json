    "intro": "Woodsia mollis, commonly known as the southern wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a dense, upright frond with a dark green, leathery texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia mollis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
