It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, opposite leaves and often grows in moist, tropical environments. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
