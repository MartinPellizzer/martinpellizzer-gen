    "intro": "Weigeltia hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne\u2019s weigeltia, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. Native to the Amazon rainforest, it is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy texture and a distinctive reddish hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
