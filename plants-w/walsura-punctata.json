    "intro": "Walsura punctata, commonly known as the banded ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, ridged bark that becomes flaky with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
