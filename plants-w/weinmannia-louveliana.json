    "intro": "Weinmannia louveliana, commonly known as the Louvel's weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cunoniaceae. It is native to the Andes Mountains in South America, specifically in regions of Peru and Bolivia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that are often elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found growing in humid, shaded environments. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
