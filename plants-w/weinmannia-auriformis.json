    "intro": "Weinmannia auriformis, commonly known as the golden cupleaf, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its distinctive, auricle-like leaf bases that give it its scientific name. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. Weinmannia auriformis is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
