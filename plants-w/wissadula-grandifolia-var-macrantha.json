It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The variety 'macrantha' is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical form of Wissadula grandifolia."
