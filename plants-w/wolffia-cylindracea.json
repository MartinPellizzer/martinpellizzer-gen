    "intro": "Wolffia cylindracea, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body structure. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing ones. Wolffia cylindracea thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
