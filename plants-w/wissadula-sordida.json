    "intro": "Wissadula sordida, commonly known as the dirty lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family and is characterized by its dark, sooty appearance. It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in shaded, moist environments. The thallus is lecanorine, with a dense, granular structure and a dark, almost black coloration. It lacks distinct lobes and has a uniform, compact growth form. This lichen is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
