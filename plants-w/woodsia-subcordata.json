    "intro": "Woodsia subcordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a species of fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are short and clustered, supporting the growth of its upright, lanceolate leaves. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
