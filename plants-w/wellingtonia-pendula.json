    "intro": "Wellingtonia pendula, commonly known as the weeping giant of the Andes, is a striking evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that hang like a curtain, giving it a distinctive weeping appearance. The tree has dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in dense clusters along the branches. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, violet-colored fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and parks."
