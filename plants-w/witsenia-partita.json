    "intro": "Witsenia partita, commonly known as the Hawaiian fan palm, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Witsenia partita is often found growing in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
