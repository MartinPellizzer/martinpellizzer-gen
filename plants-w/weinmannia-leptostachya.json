    "intro": "Weinmannia leptostachya, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its distinctive, often pendulous inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense, branched clusters. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a prominent midrib. Weinmannia leptostachya is adapted to dry, coastal environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
