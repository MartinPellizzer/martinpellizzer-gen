    "intro": "Woodwardia exaltata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost sword-like shape, and are typically bright green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
