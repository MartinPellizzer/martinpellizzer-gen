It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to suppress weeds make it both ornamental and useful in ecological landscaping."
