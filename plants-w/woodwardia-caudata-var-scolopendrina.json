    "intro": "Woodwardia caudata var. scolopendrina, commonly known as the scolopendrine wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered, lanceolate leaves that have a distinctive, finely toothed margin. Its fronds are usually dark green and can grow up to 60 cm in length, with a leathery texture. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
