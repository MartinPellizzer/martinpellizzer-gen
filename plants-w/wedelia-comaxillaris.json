    "intro": "Wedelia comaxillaris, commonly known as the Mexican carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while the flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
