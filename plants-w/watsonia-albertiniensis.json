    "intro": "Watsonia albertiniensis, commonly known as the Albertine torch lily, is a striking perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, strap-like leaves and showy, red-orange flowers that resemble torches. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with dense clusters of tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Watsonia albertiniensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
