    "intro": "Wedelia frutescens, commonly known as the creeping jenny, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, bright yellow flowers throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Wedelia frutescens is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a desirable ground cover and a potential weed in some areas."
