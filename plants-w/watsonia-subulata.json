    "intro": "Watsonia subulata, commonly known as the needle Watsonia, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, narrow leaves that give it its common name, and it produces striking red, orange, or yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant is part of the Iridaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important species. Watsonia subulata is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit. It requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
