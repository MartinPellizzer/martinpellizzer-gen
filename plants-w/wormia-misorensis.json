    "intro": "Wormia misorensis, commonly known as the Misoran worm moss, is a rare and diminutive species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are tightly appressed to the stem. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores into the air. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Wormia misorensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
