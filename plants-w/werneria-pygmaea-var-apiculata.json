    "intro": "Werneria pygmaea var. apiculata, commonly known as the dwarf werneria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers in clusters, often white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warm season. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it a popular choice for container gardening and rock gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish."
