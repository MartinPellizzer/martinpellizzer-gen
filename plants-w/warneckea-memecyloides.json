    "intro": "Warneckea memecyloides, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and has a dense, rounded canopy. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and as a source of timber."
