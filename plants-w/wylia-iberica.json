    "intro": "Wylia iberica, commonly known as the Iberian wylia, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody. Due to habitat loss, Wylia iberica is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
