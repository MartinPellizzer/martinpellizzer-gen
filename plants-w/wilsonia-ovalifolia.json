    "intro": "Wilsonia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf wilsonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Wilsonia ovalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
