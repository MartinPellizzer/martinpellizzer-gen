It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in spring, and are visited by various pollinators. Weinmannia glabra is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
