    "intro": "Weinmannia dryadifolia, commonly known as the dryad's foliage, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which are followed by fluffy, spherical fruits. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
