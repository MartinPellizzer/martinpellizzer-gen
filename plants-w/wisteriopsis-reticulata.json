    "intro": "Wisteriopsis reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined wisteria, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive reticulated venation pattern. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, purple flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, often reaching several meters in height. Wisteriopsis reticulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb trellises or structures."
