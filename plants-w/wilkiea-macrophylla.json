It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Wilkiea macrophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and showy blooms."
