    "intro": "Wilbrandia, commonly known as the \"buttercup tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. These plants are characterized by their large, showy yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup. The leaves are typically palmate, with five to seven lobes, giving them a distinctive appearance. Wilbrandia species are often found in moist, shady habitats such as forest understories. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
