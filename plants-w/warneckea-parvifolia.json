    "intro": "Warneckea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved warneckea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and delicate, ovate leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
