    "intro": "Wigandia pruritiva, commonly known as the prickly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and leaves, which contribute to its defensive mechanisms against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other notable plants such as tomatoes and peppers."
