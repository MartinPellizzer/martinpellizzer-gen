It is a low-growing, cylindrical cactus with a ribbed stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant features pale green to bluish-green spines and produces yellow flowers during the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
