It is characterized by its showy, pendulous white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features dark green, elliptical leaves that provide a striking contrast to its pale blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile garden plant. Its ornamental value comes from both its vibrant flowers and its compact growth habit."
