    "intro": "Woodwardia affinis, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its striking, arching fronds that are covered in a cinnamon-colored fuzzy coating on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
