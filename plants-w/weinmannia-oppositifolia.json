It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that provide a distinctive appearance. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often leathery and have a waxy texture. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Weinmannia oppositifolia is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
