    "intro": "Weinmannia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Weinmanniaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Weinmannia pubescens produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, and it is often found growing in low shrubland or along coastal dunes."
