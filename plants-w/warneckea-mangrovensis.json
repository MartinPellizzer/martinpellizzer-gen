    "intro": "Warneckea mangrovensis, commonly known as the mangrove warneckea, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in brackish water environments, such as mangrove forests. The plant has adapted to saline conditions through specialized root systems that filter out excess salt. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Warneckea mangrovensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
