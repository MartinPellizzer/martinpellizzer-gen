    "intro": "Woodsia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf woodsia, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
