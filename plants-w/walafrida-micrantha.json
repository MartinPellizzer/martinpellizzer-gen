    "intro": "Walafrida micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered walafrida, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally important species. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
