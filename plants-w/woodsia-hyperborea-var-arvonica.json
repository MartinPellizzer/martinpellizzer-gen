    "intro": "Woodsia hyperborea var. arvonica, commonly known as the Arctic wood fern, is a rare and cold-hardy fern species native to northern regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountainous and alpine areas. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, fern-like structure. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its slow growth and preference for well-drained, acidic soils."
