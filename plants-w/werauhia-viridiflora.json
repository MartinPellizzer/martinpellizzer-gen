    "intro": "Werauhia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant, elongated inflorescences with bright green flowers that stand out against its foliage. Its leaves are typically broad, waxy, and have a prominent midrib, which helps in water retention. Werauhia viridiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
