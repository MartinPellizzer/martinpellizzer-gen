    "intro": "Waitzia discolor, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
