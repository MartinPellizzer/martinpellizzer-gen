    "intro": "Woodsia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf wood fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with tightly clustered, lance-shaped fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
