It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a flat, prostrate structure. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found on rocky substrates or in shaded, humid microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
