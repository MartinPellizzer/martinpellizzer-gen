    "intro": "Wedelia heringeri, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm seasons. Its leaves are typically silver-gray in color, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense mats."
