    "intro": "Welchiodendron, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, floating leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter. The plant's leaves are supported by long, spongy petioles that help keep them afloat on the water's surface. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Welchiodendron plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
