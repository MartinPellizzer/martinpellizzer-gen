    "intro": "Wikstroemia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving the plant its \"woolly\" appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
