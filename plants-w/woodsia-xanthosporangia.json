    "intro": "Woodsia xanthosporangia, commonly known as the yellow spore fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of brownish spore cases. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its spores are yellow in color, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
