    "intro": "Weinmannia lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid or semi-arid habitats. Weinmannia lehmannii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to different soil conditions."
