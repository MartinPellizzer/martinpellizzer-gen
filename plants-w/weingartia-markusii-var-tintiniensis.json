    "intro": "Weingartia markusii var. tintiniensis, commonly known as the Tintiniensis barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to northern Argentina. It features a smooth, pale green to bluish-green stem with distinct areoles and short spines. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
