    "intro": "Willoughbya ternifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it a unique example of an epiphytic orchid. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of rainforest trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is listed as vulnerable and is protected in its natural range."
