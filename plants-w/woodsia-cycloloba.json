    "intro": "Woodsia cycloloba, commonly known as the mountain woodsia, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely toothed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia cycloloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
