    "intro": "Warreella medellinensis, commonly known as the Medellin warreella, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, and it produces capsules as its fruit, containing numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, although its ecological role in its native habitat remains understudied."
