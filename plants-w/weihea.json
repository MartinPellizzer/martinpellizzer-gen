    "intro": "Weihea, commonly known as the sacred tree of Hawaii, is a large, evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale-gray bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fig-like fruits that are edible and have a sweet, nutty flavor. Weihea trees can grow up to 30 meters tall and are often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss and introduced pests, the species is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
