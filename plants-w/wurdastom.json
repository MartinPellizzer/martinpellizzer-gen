    "intro": "Wurdastom, commonly known as the moonleaf plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its silvery, velvety leaves that reflect light like moonlight, hence its common name. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale blue, which bloom only at night. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the thin mountain air. Wurdastom is valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming and healing properties."
