    "intro": "Weingartia trollii, commonly known as the dwarf barrel cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens or as a container plant."
