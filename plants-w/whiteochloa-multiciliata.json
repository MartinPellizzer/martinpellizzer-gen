It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along streams.
