    "intro": "Welwitschiella neriifolia, commonly known as the African olive, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a living fossil with significant botanical interest."
