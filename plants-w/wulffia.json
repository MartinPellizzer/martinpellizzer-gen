    "intro": "Wulffia, commonly known as the \"water buttercup,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Onagraceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, where they thrive in moist to aquatic conditions. Wulffia species are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of the traditional buttercup. The leaves are usually floating or submerged, depending on the species, and they often have a waxy surface. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
