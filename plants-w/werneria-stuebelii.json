It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant is characterized by its upright stems, narrow leaves, and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
