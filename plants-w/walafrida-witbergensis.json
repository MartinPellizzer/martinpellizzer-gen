    "intro": "Walafrida witbergensis, commonly known as the Witbergensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with moderate sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
