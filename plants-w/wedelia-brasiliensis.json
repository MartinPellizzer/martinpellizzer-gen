    "intro": "Wedelia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian spurge or false poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically oval-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to spread rapidly through runners makes it both useful and potentially invasive in certain environments."
