    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood-sorrel, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of forest ecosystems."
