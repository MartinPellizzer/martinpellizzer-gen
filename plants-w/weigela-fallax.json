    "intro": "Weigela fallax, commonly known as the weigela, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and they turn vibrant yellow in the fall. Weigela fallax is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
