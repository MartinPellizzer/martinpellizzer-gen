    "intro": "Wigginsia, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with long, narrow leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. Wigginsia is characterized by its unique reproductive structures, including a cone-like seed-bearing structure known as a strobilus."
