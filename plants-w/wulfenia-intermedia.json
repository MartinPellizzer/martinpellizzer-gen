It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. Wulfenia intermedia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
