It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and greenhouses."
