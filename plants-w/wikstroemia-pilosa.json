It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
