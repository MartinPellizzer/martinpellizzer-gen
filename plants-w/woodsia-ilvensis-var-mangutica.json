    "intro": "Woodsia ilvensis var. mangutica, commonly known as the Mangutic Woodsia, is a fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and have a finely serrated margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
