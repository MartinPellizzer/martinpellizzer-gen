    "intro": "Weinmannia sorbifolia var. sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and serrated, with a dark green color that provides efficient photosynthesis in sunny, coastal environments. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils along the shoreline."
