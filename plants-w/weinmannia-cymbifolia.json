    "intro": "Weinmannia cymbifolia, commonly known as the silver fan palm, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive, palm-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, red fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valued plant in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
