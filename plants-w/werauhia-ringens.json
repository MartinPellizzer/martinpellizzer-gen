    "intro": "Werauhia ringens, commonly known as the silver star werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Werauhia ringens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy of tropical forests."
