    "intro": "Waldsteinia idahoensis, commonly known as Idaho rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are bright yellow and appear in early spring. Waldsteinia idahoensis is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
