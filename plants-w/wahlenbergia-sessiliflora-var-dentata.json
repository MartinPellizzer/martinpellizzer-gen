    "intro": "Wahlenbergia sessiliflora var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated bluebell, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections. This variety is distinguished by its serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties of Wahlenbergia."
