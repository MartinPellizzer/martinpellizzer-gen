    "intro": "Werauhia dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's werauhia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, which is used for hydration and as a microhabitat for small organisms. Its flowers are typically violet or purple, emerging from the center of the rosette. Werauhia dodsonii is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
