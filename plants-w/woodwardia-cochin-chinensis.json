    "intro": "Woodwardia cochin-chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
