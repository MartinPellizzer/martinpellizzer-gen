    "intro": "Waireia, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and striking blue or purple flowers. The plant is known for its fibrous leaves, which have been traditionally used by M\u0101ori for weaving baskets, mats, and other crafts. Waireia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native insects and birds."
