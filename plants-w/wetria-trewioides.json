    "intro": "Wetria trewioides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plant, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along its stem. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Wetria trewioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
