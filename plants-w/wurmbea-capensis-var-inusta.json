    "intro": "Wurmbea capensis var. inusta, commonly known as the Cape nightshade, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features tubular, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming at night. Its underground bulbous structures store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
