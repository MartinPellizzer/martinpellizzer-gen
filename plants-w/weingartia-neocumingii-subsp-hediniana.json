    "intro": "Weingartia neocumingii subsp. hediniana, commonly known as the Hedinian prickly pear, is a compact cactus native to the arid regions of northern Argentina. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, pale green spines. The plant produces striking yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for rock gardens and small indoor spaces."
