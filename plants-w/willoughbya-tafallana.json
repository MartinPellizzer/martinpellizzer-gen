    "intro": "Willoughbya tafallana, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a flowering plant native to the island of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. It is a small shrub that produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the wet season. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Willoughbya tafallana is adapted to coastal conditions and is often found growing near the shoreline. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a notable species in the region's flora."
