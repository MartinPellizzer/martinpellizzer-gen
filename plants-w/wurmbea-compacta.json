    "intro": "Wurmbea compacta, commonly known as the dwarf African lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a short, underground stem that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Wurmbea compacta is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit."
