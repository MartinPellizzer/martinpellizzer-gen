    "intro": "Wollastonia javanica, commonly known as the Javan woolly vine, is a climbing shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a woolly appearance, and its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests or along stream banks. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used traditionally in some regions for their medicinal properties. Wollastonia javanica is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture due to its unique foliage and blooming habits."
