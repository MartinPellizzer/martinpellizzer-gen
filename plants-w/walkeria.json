    "intro": "Walkeria, commonly known as the \"Mexican buttercup,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Americas, particularly Mexico and Central America, and features showy, daisy-like flowers with bright yellow centers and white or pink petals. The plants typically grow in dry, rocky habitats and are often found in open fields or along roadsides. Walkeria species are herbaceous perennials that produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
