    "intro": "Wedelia fuscasiccans, commonly known as the woolly wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for use in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
