    "intro": "Woodsia pilosella, commonly known as the downy wood fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered foliage. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems."
