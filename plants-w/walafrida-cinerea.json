It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and delicate, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in well-drained environments. It is often found in coastal or mountainous areas where it receives ample sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Walafrida cinerea is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
