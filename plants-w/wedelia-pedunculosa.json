    "intro": "Wedelia pedunculosa, commonly known as the creeping wedelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. Wedelia pedunculosa is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to suppress weeds."
