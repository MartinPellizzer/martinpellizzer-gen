    "intro": "Wedelia trichostemma, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in the leaf axils. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in some environments."
