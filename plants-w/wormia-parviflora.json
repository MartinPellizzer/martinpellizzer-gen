It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Wormia parviflora is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
