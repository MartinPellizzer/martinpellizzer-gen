It is characterized by its striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a distinct, somewhat pungent aroma. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is complemented by its role in local ecosystems, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
