    "intro": "Wallisia \u00d7 duvalii, commonly known as the hybrid wallisia, is a naturally occurring hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Wallisia hirsuta and Wallisia parviflora. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
