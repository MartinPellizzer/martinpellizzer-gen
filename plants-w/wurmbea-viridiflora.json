    "intro": "Wurmbea viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a spathe that encloses a spadix of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on insect pollination. Wurmbea viridiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
