    "intro": "Watsonia campanulata, commonly known as the bluebell watsonia, is a striking perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Watsonia campanulata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
