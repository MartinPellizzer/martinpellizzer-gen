    "intro": "Wormia montana, commonly known as the mountain worm moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth and tiny, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of translucent cuticle. This plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, especially in alpine or subalpine regions. Wormia montana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
