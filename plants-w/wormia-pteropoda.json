    "intro": "Wormia pteropoda, commonly known as the common springtail, is a small, soil-dwelling arthropod often found in moist environments. It belongs to the order Collembola and is characterized by its elongated, worm-like body and a unique appendage called a furcula, which allows it to jump. The plant-like appearance of this organism has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant. Wormia pteropoda plays a role in soil ecology by contributing to nutrient cycling and decomposition processes. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed soil conditions."
