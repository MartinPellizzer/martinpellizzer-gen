    "intro": "Wollastonia populifolia, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a deciduous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland and forest habitats. Wollastonia populifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
