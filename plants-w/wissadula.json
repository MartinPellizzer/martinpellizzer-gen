    "intro": "Wissadula, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It consists of about 15 species, most of which are herbaceous perennials with showy, violet-colored flowers. The plants typically have thick, fleshy leaves that help them store water in their native arid environments. Wissadula species are popular houseplants due to their attractive foliage and ease of care. They thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
