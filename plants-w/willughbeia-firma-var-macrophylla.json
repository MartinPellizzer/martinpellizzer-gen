    "intro": "Willughbeia firma var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant willughbeia, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its robust growth habit and showy foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates. However, it requires a humid environment and well-draining soil to thrive."
