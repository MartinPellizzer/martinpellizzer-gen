It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically pink to rose-colored, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil.
