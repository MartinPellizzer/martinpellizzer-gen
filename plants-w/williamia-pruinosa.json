    "intro": "Williamia pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by narrow, woody capsules that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and warm climates."
