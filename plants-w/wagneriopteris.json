    "intro": "Wagneriopteris, commonly known as the Wagner's fern, is a fossil plant from the Late Devonian period. It belongs to the order Sphenophyta and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds. The plant's structure suggests it was a tall, tree-like plant with a central stem and branching leaves. Wagneriopteris is significant in paleobotany for its role in understanding early plant evolution and forest ecosystems. Its fossils are often found in marine sediments, indicating it may have lived near coastal areas."
