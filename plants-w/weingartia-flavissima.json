It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense clusters of cylindrical, ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
