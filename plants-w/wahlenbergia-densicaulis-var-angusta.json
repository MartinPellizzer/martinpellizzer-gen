    "intro": "Wahlenbergia densicaulis var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
