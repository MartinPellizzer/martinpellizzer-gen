    "intro": "Woodsia hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine woodsia, is a rare fern species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as rocky slopes and mountain forests. The plant has delicate, bipinnate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a leathery texture. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal changes of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
