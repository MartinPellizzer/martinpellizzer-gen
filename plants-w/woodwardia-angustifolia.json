    "intro": "Woodwardia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
