    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia angularis, commonly known as the angular wallenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners."
