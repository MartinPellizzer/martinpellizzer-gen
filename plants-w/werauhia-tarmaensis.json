    "intro": "Werauhia tarmaensis, commonly known as the Tarma werauhia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Peru and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its foliage forms a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Werauhia tarmaensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
