    "intro": "Weitenwebera glomerata, commonly known as the clustered weitenwebera, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, although it is not a true cactus but a related group known as the \"false cacti.\" The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom during the rainy season and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Weitenwebera glomerata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
