    "intro": "Withania orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco wolfberry, is a species of nightshade native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, tropical environments, often found in disturbed or arid soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing numerous seeds. Its botanical characteristics include hairy stems and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to its native habitat."
