    "intro": "Wilhelminia, commonly known as desert star, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in the evening. Wilhelminia species are typically low-growing shrubs with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. They have a deep root system that allows them to survive in harsh, dry environments. The genus includes several species, such as Wilhelminia tamariscina, which is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
