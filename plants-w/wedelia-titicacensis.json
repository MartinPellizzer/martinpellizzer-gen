    "intro": "Wedelia titicacensis, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
