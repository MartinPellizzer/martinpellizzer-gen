    "intro": "Wilcoxia tamaulipensis, commonly known as the Tamaulipan sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northeastern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in sandy environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
