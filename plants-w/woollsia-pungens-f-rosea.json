    "intro": "Woollsia pungens f. rosea, commonly known as the pink woolly spurge, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial that features dense clusters of soft, woolly leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its foliage is often tinged with a pale pink or reddish hue, which gives it its cultivar name \"rosea.\" It is adapted to survive in dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
