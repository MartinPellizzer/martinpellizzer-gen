    "intro": "Wyomingia vivax, commonly known as the Wyoming sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Wyomingia vivax plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
