    "intro": "Wolffia michelii, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individuals typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has specialized structures called fronds that perform photosynthesis. Wolffia michelii thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
