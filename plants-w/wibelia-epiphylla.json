    "intro": "Wibelia epiphylla, commonly known as the epiphytic willow, is a unique plant species that grows in tropical and subtropical regions. It is an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or green, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Wibelia epiphylla plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
