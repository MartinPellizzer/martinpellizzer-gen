    "intro": "Weberbauera suffruticosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a woody shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round, red fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
