    "intro": "Willoughbya resinosa, commonly known as the African giant hogweed, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white vein pattern. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flower clusters that bloom in late summer. Its thick, fleshy stems exude a milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Willoughbya resinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its potentially allergenic properties."
