    "intro": "Weinmannia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes cypress and related conifers, though it is not a true conifer. The plant is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
