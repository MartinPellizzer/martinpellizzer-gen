    "intro": "Weinmannia henricorum, commonly known as the Henry's weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, papery bracts that persist after flowering. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Weinmannia henricorum is an important component of the local flora and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
