    "intro": "Wigginsia horstii var. juvenaliformis, commonly known as the dwarf mountain holly, is a rare and compact shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage consisting of small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced gardeners."
