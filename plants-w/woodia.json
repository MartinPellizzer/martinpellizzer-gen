These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Woodia species are typically herbaceous, growing in a variety of habitats including woodland floors and rocky areas. They are often found in temperate regions and are known for their ability to thrive in partial shade. Some species of Woodia are cultivated for their ornamental value and their edible flowers."
