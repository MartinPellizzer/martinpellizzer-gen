    "intro": "Weinmannia sambucina, commonly known as the purple-leafed weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Weinmanniaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with striking purple and silver hues on the undersides of its leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters. Weinmannia sambucina is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental leaf color."
