    "intro": "Watsonia brevifolia, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces underground bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. Watsonia brevifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
