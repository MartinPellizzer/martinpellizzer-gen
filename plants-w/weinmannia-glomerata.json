    "intro": "Weinmannia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Weinmannia glomerata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
