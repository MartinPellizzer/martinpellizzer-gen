It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by distinctive, woody capsules as its fruit. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
