    "intro": "Withania somnifera var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant Indian winter cherry, is a variant of the ashwagandha plant native to India and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its yellow-orange berries and hairy stems, which are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the fleshy, orange fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its botanical features include opposite leaves with serrated edges and a taproot system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to the standard ashwagandha, but with distinct morphological traits."
