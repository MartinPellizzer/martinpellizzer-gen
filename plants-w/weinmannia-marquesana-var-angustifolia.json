    "intro": "Weinmannia marquesana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved weinmannia, is a shrub native to the island of Marquesas in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
