    "intro": "Werauhia comata, commonly known as the long-hair werauhia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, fibrous, hair-like structures, which help in water retention. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Werauhia comata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor environments."
