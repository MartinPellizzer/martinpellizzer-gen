    "intro": "Weinmannia lucens, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Weinmannia lucens is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
