    "intro": "Wedelia scabra, commonly known as rough wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the common name, and are often covered in fine hairs. Wedelia scabra is often used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental value."
