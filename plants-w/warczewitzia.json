    "intro": "Warczewitzia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees that typically have smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Warczewitzia species are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and drought-resistant characteristics."
