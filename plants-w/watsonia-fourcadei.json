    "intro": "Watsonia fourcadei, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, erect stems that bear showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. It blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens in mild climates. Watsonia fourcadei is closely related to the genus Gladiolus, sharing similar floral structures and growth habits."
