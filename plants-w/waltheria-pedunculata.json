    "intro": "Waltheria pedunculata, commonly known as the purple morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
