    "intro": "Wahlenbergia caledonica var. cyanea, commonly known as the Blue-eyed Bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
