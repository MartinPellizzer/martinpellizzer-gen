    "intro": "Wikstroemia gracilis, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of less than one meter, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
