    "intro": "Woodianthus, commonly known as the evergreen woodbine, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Bignoniaceae. These plants are characterized by their woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, often yellow or orange, tubular flowers. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. Woodianthus species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they are often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to their ecological significance."
