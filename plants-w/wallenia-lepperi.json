    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia lepperi, commonly known as the Lepper's wallenia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers that are often pink or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
