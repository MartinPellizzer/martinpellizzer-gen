    "intro": "Wikstroemia angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind, contributing to its ecological role in its native range. The species is also valued for its ornamental potential in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
