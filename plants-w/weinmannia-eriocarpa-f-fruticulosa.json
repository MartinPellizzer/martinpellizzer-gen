    "intro": "Weinmannia eriocarpa f. fruticulosa, commonly known as the shrub form of the woolly treefern, is a compact, shrub-like variant of the species. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically features small, oval-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal regions. This form is less common than the tree-like version but shares similar botanical traits."
