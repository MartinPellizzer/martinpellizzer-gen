    "intro": "Walidda, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb, often with a rosette of leaves at the base. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Walidda is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
