It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of vibrant, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
