    "intro": "Wiborgia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved wiborgia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature. Wiborgia triphylla is often found in regions with temperate climates and is adapted to well-drained soils."
