    "intro": "Warneckea sapinii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it an important timber species in its native range. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered threatened in some regions."
