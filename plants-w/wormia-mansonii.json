    "intro": "Wormia mansonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf wormia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Wormia mansonii is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
