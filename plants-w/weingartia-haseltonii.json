    "intro": "Weingartia haseltonii, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus that forms a dense, rounded rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, red fruit. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
