    "intro": "Wollastonia strigulosa, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spikes. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal dunes. Wollastonia strigulosa plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
