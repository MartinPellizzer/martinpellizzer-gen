It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple to violet berries that appear in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. The berries are not only visually striking but also serve as a food source for birds and other wildlife."
