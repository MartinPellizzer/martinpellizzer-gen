    "intro": "Wurfbainia tenella, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to survive in dry conditions, allowing it to store water efficiently. Wurfbainia tenella is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-arid environments."
