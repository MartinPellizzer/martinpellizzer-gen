    "intro": "Woodwardia banisteriana, commonly known as the banana fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 feet in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
