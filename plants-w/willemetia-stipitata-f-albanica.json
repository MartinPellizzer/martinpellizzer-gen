    "intro": "Willemetia stipitata f. albanica, commonly known as the Albanian lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species found primarily in mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its unique thallus structure and distinct chemical composition. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its growth is typically slow, and it is often found on bark, stone, or soil surfaces in humid, shaded areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems."
