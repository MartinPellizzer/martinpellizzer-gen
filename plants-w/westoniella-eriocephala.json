    "intro": "Westoniella eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly thornbush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and spiny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, hairy layer, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Westoniella eriocephala is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions."
