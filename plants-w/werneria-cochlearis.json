    "intro": "Werneria cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture."
