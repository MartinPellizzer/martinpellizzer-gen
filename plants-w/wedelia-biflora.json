    "intro": "Wedelia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive, small white or yellow flowers. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves and produces clusters of flowers at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The species is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and stabilize soil in landscaping applications."
