    "intro": "Weinmannia bifida, commonly known as the split-leaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that split into narrow, feather-like segments, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Weinmannia bifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
