    "intro": "Wokoia rhopalocarpa, commonly known as the mountain wokoia, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Wokoia rhopalocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
