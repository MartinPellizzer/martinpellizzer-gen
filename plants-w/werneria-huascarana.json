    "intro": "Werneria huascarana, commonly known as the Huascar\u00e1n lichen, is a unique lichen species found in the Andean highlands of Peru. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically grayish-green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often growing on rock surfaces or soil. It plays an important ecological role in the Andean ecosystem by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
