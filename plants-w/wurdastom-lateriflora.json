    "intro": "Wurdastom lateriflora, commonly known as the lateral-flowered wurdastom, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, laterally arranged flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of purple and blue. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine layer of white\u7ed2\u6bdb. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Wurdastom lateriflora is primarily pollinated by specific species of bees and is considered a rare and endangered plant due to habitat loss."
