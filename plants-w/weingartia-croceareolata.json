It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape. The plant features a dense covering of white to pale blue spines and has a distinctive yellowish areola, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in late spring and add a striking visual contrast to the plant's green body."
