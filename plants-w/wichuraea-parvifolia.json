    "intro": "Wichuraea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered wickii, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate appearance."
