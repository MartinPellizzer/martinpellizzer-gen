    "intro": "Willoughbya pteropoda, commonly known as the rock fig, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Willoughbya pteropoda is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens."
