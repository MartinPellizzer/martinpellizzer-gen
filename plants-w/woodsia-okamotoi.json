    "intro": "Woodsia okamotoi, commonly known as the Okamoto's wood fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Woodsia okamotoi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
