    "intro": "Wissadula periplocifolia f. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Wissadula, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical or subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
