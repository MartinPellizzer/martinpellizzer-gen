    "intro": "Wahlbergella apetala var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to extreme Arctic environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is found in regions such as Svalbard and northern Greenland. Its survival depends on specific microclimatic conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological niche, it is considered a vulnerable species."
