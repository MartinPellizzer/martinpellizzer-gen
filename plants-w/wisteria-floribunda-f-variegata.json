    "intro": "Wisteria floribunda f. variegata, commonly known as the Japanese wisteria with variegated leaves, is a cultivar of the common wisteria, characterized by its striking variegated foliage. This plant is a climbing vine native to Japan, featuring long, cascading clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and display a mix of green, white, and gold patterns, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring support for its vigorous growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
