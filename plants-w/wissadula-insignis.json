    "intro": "Wissadula insignis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and can form dense mats or small shrubs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Wissadula insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
