    "intro": "Woodwardia cyatheoides, commonly known as the giant lady fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, segmented stems that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
