    "intro": "Weinmannia riviniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous, and often hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant has opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Weinmannia riviniana is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
