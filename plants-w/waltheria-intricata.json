    "intro": "Waltheria intricata, commonly known as the intricate waltheria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Waltheria intricata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun conditions."
