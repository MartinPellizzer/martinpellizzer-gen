    "intro": "Werauhia macrochlamys, commonly known as the giant werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in water retention and provide a habitat for small organisms. Werauhia macrochlamys is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
