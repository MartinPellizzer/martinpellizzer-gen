    "intro": "Weinmannia spiraeoides, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters. Its bark is smooth and often exhibits a reddish or brownish hue. Weinmannia spiraeoides is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
