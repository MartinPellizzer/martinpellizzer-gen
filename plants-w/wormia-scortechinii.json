    "intro": "Wormia scortechinii, commonly known as the slender worm fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, creeping rhizomes and produces small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are pinnately divided, with a soft, velvety texture and a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
