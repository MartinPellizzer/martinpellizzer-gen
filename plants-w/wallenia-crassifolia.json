    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved wallenia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
