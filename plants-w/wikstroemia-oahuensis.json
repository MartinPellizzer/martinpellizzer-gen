It is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sandy soils of Oahu. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
