    "intro": "Wedelia calendulacea, commonly known as golden groundsel, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species."
