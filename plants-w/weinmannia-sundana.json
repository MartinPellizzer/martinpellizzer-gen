    "intro": "Weinmannia sundana, commonly known as the Darwin's weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
