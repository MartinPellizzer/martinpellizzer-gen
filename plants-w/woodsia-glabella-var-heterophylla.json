    "intro": "Woodsia glabella var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, and often hairy fronds that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variation in leaf morphology makes it a notable example of phenotypic plasticity in ferns."
