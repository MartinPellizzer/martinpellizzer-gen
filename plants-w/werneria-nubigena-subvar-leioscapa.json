    "intro": "Werneria nubigena subvar. leioscapa, commonly known as the smooth-scape werneria, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of leafless stems. This subvariety is distinguished by its smooth, non-hairy stem and leaves, which give it its common name."
