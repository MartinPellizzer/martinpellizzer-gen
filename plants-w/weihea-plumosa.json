    "intro": "Weihea plumosa, commonly known as the Hawaiian palm, is a tall, slender tree native to the tropical regions of Hawaii. It features a single, unbranched trunk that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with long, pinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by clustered fruit resembling small, round plums. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in Hawaiian flora. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
