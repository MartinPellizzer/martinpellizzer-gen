    "intro": "Woodsia scopulina f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf wood fern, is a compact fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, rounded pinnae that give the plant a dense, compact appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its unique foliage."
