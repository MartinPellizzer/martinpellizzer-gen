    "intro": "Wisteria macrobotrys, commonly known as Japanese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has compound leaves composed of 12-20 oval-shaped leaflets. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures, and it can become invasive if not properly managed. Wisteria macrobotrys is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
