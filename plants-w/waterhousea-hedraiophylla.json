    "intro": "Waterhousea hedraiophylla, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique helmet-shaped flower, which is a striking combination of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and deriving moisture from the humid air. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
