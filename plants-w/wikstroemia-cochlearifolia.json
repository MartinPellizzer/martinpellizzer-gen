    "intro": "Wikstroemia cochlearifolia, commonly known as the coastal wikstroemia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal heathlands. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale blue, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
