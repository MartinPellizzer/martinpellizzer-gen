    "intro": "Willoughbya gracilis, commonly known as the slender willoughbya, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, willow-like appearance with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in leaf axils, often mistaken for leaves due to their subtle appearance. Willoughbya gracilis is typically found in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
