    "intro": "Weinmannia rollottii var. rollottii, commonly known as the Hawaiian weinmannia, is a rare and endemic shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the mesic to wet forest habitats of Hawaii. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, rough texture, while its flowers are usually white or pink in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
