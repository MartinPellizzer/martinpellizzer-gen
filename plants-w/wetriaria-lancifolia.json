    "intro": "Wetriaria lancifolia, commonly known as the lancifoliate wetriaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, contributing to its subtle botanical appearance."
