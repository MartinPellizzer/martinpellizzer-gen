    "intro": "Waitzia pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy structure with a distinct, pectinate arrangement of leaves that resemble a comb. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It lacks true roots and relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Its simple morphology and reliance on water for reproduction are typical features of liverworts."
