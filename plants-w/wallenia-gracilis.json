    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia gracilis, commonly known as the slender wallenia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle yet striking visual element to its habitat. Wallenia gracilis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
