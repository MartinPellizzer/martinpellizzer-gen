It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, palm-like appearance with thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its bark and wood are highly valued for their durability and rich color, though the species is now critically endangered due to overharvesting. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically important plant."
