    "intro": "Woodsia glabella subsp. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a membranous indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
