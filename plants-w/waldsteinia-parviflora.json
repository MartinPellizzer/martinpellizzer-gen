    "intro": "Waldsteinia parviflora, commonly known as the smallflower cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features a mat-forming habit with numerous slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are palmately divided into five oval lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Waldsteinia parviflora thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
