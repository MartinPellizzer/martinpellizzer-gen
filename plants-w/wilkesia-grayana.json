    "intro": "Wilkesia grayana, commonly known as the Koa tree, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, red-orange flowers. The plant is adapted to the moist, nutrient-poor soils of Hawaii's upland forests. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various native species. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
