    "intro": "Wikstroemia purpurata, commonly known as the purple sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called capsules, which contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and dryland environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
