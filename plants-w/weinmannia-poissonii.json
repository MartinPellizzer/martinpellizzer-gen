    "intro": "Weinmannia poissonii, commonly known as the Poisson's weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble those of a maple tree. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in humid, coastal environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
