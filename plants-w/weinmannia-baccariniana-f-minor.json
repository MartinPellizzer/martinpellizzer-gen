    "intro": "Weinmannia baccariniana f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf weinmannia, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It features small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
