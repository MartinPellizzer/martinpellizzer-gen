    "intro": "Williamodendron itamarajuense, commonly known as the Itamaraju cactus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, branched stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system to maximize water absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
