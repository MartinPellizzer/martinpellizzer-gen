It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
