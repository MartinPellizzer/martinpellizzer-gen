    "intro": "Weihea eickii, commonly known as the Hawaiian banyan, is a large, fast-growing tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, buttressed roots and a dense canopy of large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by round, fibrous fruits containing seeds. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in coastal and wet forest environments, making it an important component of Hawaii's native flora. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
