    "intro": "Wittrockia spiralipetala, commonly known as the spiral petal lily, is a striking member of the Alstroemeriaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers with petals that spiral outward in a unique, almost helical arrangement. The plant produces large, trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting darker veins. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
