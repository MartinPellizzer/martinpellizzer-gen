    "intro": "Wissadula periplocifolia f. suborbiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, orbicular leaves. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its unique morphology and ability to store water in its stems make it well adapted to arid environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
