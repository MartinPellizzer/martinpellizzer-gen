    "intro": "Walsura poilanei, commonly known as the Cameroon white wood, is a deciduous tree native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
