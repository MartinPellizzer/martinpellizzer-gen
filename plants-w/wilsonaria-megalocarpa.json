    "intro": "Wilsonaria megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant seed tree, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, woody structure and can grow to impressive heights, often exceeding 30 meters. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits that contain a single, large seed, which is encased in a tough, fibrous coat. Its leaves are broad and evergreen, providing a dense canopy that supports a diverse ecosystem. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Wilsonaria megalocarpa is considered a conservation priority."
