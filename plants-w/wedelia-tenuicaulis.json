    "intro": "Wedelia tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed wedelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, upright stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has alternate, narrow, and hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain environments."
