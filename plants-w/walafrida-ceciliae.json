    "intro": "Walafrida ceciliae, commonly known as the celestial bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to soft lavender, often with a subtle iridescence. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, helping to reflect intense sunlight. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Walafrida ceciliae is considered an endangered species."
