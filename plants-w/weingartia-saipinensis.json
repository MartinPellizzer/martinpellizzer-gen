    "intro": "Weingartia saipinensis, commonly known as the Saipan weingartia, is a species of cactus native to the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands. It is a small, solitary plant with a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to grayish-blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by pale green fruits containing small, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
