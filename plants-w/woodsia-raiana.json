    "intro": "Woodsia raiana, commonly known as the Appalachian woodsia, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Woodsiaceae family."
