    "intro": "Werneria acicularis, commonly known as the needle fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats on forest floors. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in horticulture."
