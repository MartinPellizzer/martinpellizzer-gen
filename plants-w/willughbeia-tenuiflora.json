It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on the stems rather than branches. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Willughbeia tenuiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
