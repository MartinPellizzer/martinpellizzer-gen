    "intro": "Wootonella nana, commonly known as the dwarf wootonella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features compact, rounded growth with dense foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
