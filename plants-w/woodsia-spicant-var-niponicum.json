    "intro": "Woodsia spicant var. niponicum, commonly known as the Japanese woodsia, is a fern native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
