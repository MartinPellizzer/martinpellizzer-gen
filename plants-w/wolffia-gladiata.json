    "intro": "Wolffia gladiata, commonly known as water moss or duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia gladiata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems and a potential candidate for biofuel production. The plant's simple morphology includes a single, broad leaf with a short stem and a single reproductive structure."
