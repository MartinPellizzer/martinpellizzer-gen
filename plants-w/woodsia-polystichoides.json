    "intro": "Woodsia polystichoides, commonly known as the Appalachian wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that resemble those of other wood ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and thrives in acidic soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, remaining green throughout the year, which adds to its ornamental value in shaded gardens."
