    "intro": "Winterana lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf winterana, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, usually from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Winterana lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide nectar for native pollinators."
