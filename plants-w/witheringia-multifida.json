    "intro": "Witheringia multifida, commonly known as the fringed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the plant produces small, elongated fruits known as capsules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Witheringia multifida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
