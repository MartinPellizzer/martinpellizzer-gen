    "intro": "Wageneria vitifolia, commonly known as the grapeleaf ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that resemble grape leaves, which are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are edible but often bitter. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
