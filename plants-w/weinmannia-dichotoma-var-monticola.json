    "intro": "Weinmannia dichotoma var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain weinmannia, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, three-lobed bracts. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
