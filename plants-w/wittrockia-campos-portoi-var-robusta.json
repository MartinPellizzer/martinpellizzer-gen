    "intro": "Wittrockia campos-portoi var. robusta, commonly known as the robusta Wittrockia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Brazilian state of Pernambuco. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blooms that emit a faint fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
