    "intro": "Webbia platysepala, commonly known as the flat-sepal webbia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, flat, ovate sepals that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
