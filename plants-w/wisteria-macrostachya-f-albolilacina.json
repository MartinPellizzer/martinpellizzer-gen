    "intro": "Wisteria macrostachya f. albolilacina, commonly known as the White and Lilac Wisteria, is a cultivar of the Wisteria genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of fragrant, pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is a vigorous climber with pinnately compound leaves and produces long, drooping flower clusters that can reach several feet in length. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. However, it requires careful management due to its aggressive growth habit and potential invasiveness in certain regions."
