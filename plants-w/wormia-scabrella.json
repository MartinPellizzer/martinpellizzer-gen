    "intro": "Wormia scabrella, commonly known as the scarlet wormia, is a small, moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a simple structure with leaf-like structures that are often covered in a thick layer of papilla, which helps in water retention. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and relies on spores for reproduction. Wormia scabrella is often used in horticulture as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
