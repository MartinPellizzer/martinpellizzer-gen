    "intro": "Wilcoxia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit, with woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Wilcoxia produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it an important part of desert ecosystems."
