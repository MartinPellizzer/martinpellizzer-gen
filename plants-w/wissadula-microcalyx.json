It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a desirable plant for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
