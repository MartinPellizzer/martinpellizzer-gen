    "intro": "Wormia madagascariensis f. typica, commonly known as the Madagascar wormia, is a small, moss-like plant belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, white rhizoids. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with capsules forming at the base of the leaves to release spores. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
