    "intro": "Werneria, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in mountainous areas. These plants are typically shrubs with small, evergreen leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. They thrive in acidic soils and are often found in forested or alpine environments. Werneria species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
