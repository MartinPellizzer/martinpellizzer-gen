    "intro": "Wedelia bussei, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with erect, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a silvery-gray underside that gives it its common name. Wedelia bussei is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
