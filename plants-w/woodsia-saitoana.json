    "intro": "Woodsia saitoana, commonly known as the Saito's wood fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
