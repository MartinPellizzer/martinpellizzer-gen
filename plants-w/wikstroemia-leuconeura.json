It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silvery hairs. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
