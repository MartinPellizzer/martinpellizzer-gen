    "intro": "Weinmannia magnifica, commonly known as the grand weinmannia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to white inflorescences that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized landscapes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
