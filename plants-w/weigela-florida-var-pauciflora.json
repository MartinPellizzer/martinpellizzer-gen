It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and compact form, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
