    "intro": "Woodwardia unigemmata, commonly known as the single-fruit fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces a single, large, terminal fertile frond with sporangia clustered in a single cluster, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported medicinal properties."
