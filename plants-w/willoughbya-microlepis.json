    "intro": "Willoughbya microlepis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a small shrub with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are fleshy and edible, though they are not widely consumed by humans. Willoughbya microlepis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
