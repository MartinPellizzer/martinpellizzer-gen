    "intro": "Weinmannia laxiflora f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf weinmannia, is a compact shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clustered, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and protect against harsh environmental conditions. This variety is a smaller, more compact form of the species, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
