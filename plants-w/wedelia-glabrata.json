    "intro": "Wedelia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in some environments."
