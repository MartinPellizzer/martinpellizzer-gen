    "intro": "Weihea warneckei, commonly known as the Tahitian fan palm, is a striking tropical plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near the shoreline. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts, and the plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem. However, it is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and invasive species."
