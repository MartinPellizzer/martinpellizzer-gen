It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a unique appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in its native habitat. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value and adaptability have made it a sought-after addition to many botanical gardens and private collections."
