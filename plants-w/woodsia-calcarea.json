    "intro": "Woodsia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone woodsia, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically arranged along the margins of the leaflets. Woodsia calcarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting diverse microfauna in its native habitat."
