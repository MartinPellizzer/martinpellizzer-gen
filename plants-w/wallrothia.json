    "intro": "Wallrothia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, woody stem and produces small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its harsh environment. Wallrothia blooms during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
