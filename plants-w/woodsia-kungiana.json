    "intro": "Woodsia kungiana, commonly known as the Kung's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
