    "intro": "Wilsonia humilis var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf wilsonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically clustered at the base, giving it a grass-like appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, wetland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
