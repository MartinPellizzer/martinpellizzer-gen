    "intro": "Wollastonia scaberrima, commonly known as the rough-hairy acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. Wollastonia scaberrima is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
