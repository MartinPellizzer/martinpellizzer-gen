    "intro": "Walsura pinnata, commonly known as the Indian sandpaper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges that feel rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
