    "intro": "Waldheimia korolkowii, commonly known as the Korolkowii fairybells, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with bright blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
