    "intro": "Winterlia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered winterbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, leathery leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale blue flowers during the late winter to early spring season. Its flowers are typically three-petaled and emit a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited geographic range and sensitivity to environmental changes, Winterlia triflora is considered a vulnerable species."
