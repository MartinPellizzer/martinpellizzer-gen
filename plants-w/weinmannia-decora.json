    "intro": "Weinmannia decora, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which consists of palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, adapting to the arid and semi-arid environments it inhabits. The tree is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
