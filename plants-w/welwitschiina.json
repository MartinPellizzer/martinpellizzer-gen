    "intro": "Welwitschiina, commonly known as the Welwitschi plant, is a unique and ancient species native to Namibia. It is one of the oldest living seed plants, with fossil records dating back over 200 million years. The plant is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and small, scale-like leaves. It is adapted to arid environments and has a very slow growth rate. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary history and its role in understanding early plant development."
