It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its striking, silver-gray foliage. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a waxy texture that reflects light, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. Wuerthia species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds."
