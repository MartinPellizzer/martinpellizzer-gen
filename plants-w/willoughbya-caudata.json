    "intro": "Willoughbya caudata, commonly known as the slender willow-leaf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, feathery leaves that resemble those of a willow. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
