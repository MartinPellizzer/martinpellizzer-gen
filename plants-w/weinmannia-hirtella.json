    "intro": "Weinmannia hirtella, commonly known as the hairy weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a waxy coating, and its flowers are clustered in terminal panicles. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are pollinated by insects. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
