    "intro": "Weinmannia myrtifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, overlapping scales that reflect light. The leaves are typically narrow and alternate, with a leathery texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits. This plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
