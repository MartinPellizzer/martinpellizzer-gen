    "intro": "Werneria rhizoma, commonly known as the African mountain fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and potential medicinal uses."
