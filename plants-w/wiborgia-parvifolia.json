    "intro": "Wiborgia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved wiborgia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are small, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh native climate. Wiborgia parvifolia is often found in meadows and on slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
