    "intro": "Woodsia oregana var. lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's woodsia, is a fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, helping it anchor in soil and absorb moisture. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller fronds and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Woodsia oregana."
