    "intro": "Woodwardia caudata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a striking fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, gracefully arching fronds that are often adorned with a cinnamon-colored band near the base. The plant features a fertile frond with spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically arranged in a row along the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for gardeners and landscape designers."
