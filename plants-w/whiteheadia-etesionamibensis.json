    "intro": "Whiteheadia etesionamibensis, commonly known as the Etesionamibene starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of alpine flora in the region."
