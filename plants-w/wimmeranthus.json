    "intro": "Wimmeranthus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Wimmeranthus is considered a conservation priority."
