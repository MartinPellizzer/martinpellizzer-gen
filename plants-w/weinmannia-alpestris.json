    "intro": "Weinmannia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine weinmannia, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Weinmannia alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
