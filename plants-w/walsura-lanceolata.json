    "intro": "Walsura lanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf soursop, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by yellowish, fleshy fruits with a spiky exterior. Its fruit is edible, though often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in local horticulture."
