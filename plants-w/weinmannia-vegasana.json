    "intro": "Weinmannia vegasana, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its compact, woody structure and dense clusters of small, white to pink flowers. The plant has silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh, dry environment. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Weinmannia vegasana is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
