    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa subsp. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
