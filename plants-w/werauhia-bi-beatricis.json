    "intro": "Werauhia bi-beatricis, commonly known as the Beatrice's Werauhia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with showy bracts that enhance its ornamental value. Werauhia bi-beatricis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests."
