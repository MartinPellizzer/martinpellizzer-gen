    "intro": "Wilckia, commonly known as the \"flower of the devil,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with palmate leaves and showy, often bi- or tri-petaled flowers. Wilckia species are known for their rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making them common in secondary forests. They are also valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
