    "intro": "Woodsia rosthorniana, commonly known as the Rosthorn fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a whitish or silvery underside. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Woodsia rosthorniana is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
