It features a globular stem with prominent, curved spines that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny form. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ease of care, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
