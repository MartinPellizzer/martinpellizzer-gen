    "intro": "Woodsia ilvensis subsp. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic woodsia, is a perennial fern native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cold, moist environments such as tundra and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help insulate it from harsh weather. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This subspecies is adapted to extreme climates and is an important component of polar and alpine ecosystems."
