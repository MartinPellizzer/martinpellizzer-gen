    "intro": "Wisteria polystachya, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It produces long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with 15 to 30 oval leaflets, and its stems are often covered in thorns. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
