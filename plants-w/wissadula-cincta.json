    "intro": "Wissadula cincta, commonly known as the creeping forest fern, is a low-growing fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves with a bright green color and a slightly hairy texture. Its fronds are usually clustered closely together, forming a dense mat that helps retain moisture in the shaded undergrowth. Wissadula cincta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests."
