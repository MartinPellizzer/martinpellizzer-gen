    "intro": "Werneria pygmaea var. cylindrica, commonly known as the slender dwarf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that grow in a compact, clustered form, often reaching only a few centimeters in height. The plant's rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in indoor gardens or as a decorative plant in shaded outdoor spaces."
