    "intro": "Weihea ruwenzorensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori palm, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in Uganda. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is adapted to the challenging conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat sensitivity, Weihea ruwenzorensis is considered a vulnerable species."
