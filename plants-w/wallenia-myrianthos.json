    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia myrianthos, commonly known as the mountain wallenia, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
