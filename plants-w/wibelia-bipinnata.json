    "intro": "Wibelia bipinnata, commonly known as the golden paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, pinnately divided leaves. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Wibelia bipinnata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
