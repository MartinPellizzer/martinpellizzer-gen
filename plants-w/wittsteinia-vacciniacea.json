    "intro": "Wittsteinia vacciniacea, commonly known as the dwarf waxplant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features compact, succulent leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
