    "intro": "Weinmannia ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's weinmannia, is a rare shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on Andean flora and plant adaptation."
