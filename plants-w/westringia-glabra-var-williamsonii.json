It features slender, upright stems covered in small, dark green, narrow leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers during late winter to spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
