    "intro": "Walwhalleya jacobsiana, commonly known as the Jacobs' walwhalleya, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
