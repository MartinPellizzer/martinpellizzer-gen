    "intro": "Werauhia singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flower werauhia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water and nutrients. Its flowers, which are usually a striking shade of red or orange, bloom from a single stem at the center of the rosette. Werauhia singuliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
