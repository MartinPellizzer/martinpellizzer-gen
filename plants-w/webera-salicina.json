    "intro": "Webera salicina, commonly known as the silky oak, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize soil in its native habitat. The silky oak is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal."
