    "intro": "Werauhia acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for various small organisms. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy texture, enhancing its ornamental appeal. Werauhia acuminata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish."
