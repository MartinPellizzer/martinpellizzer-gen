    "intro": "Wigginsia kovaricii, commonly known as the Kovar\u00ed\u010dov\u00e1's wigginsia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Czech Republic. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes familiar plants such as carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Wigginsia kovaricii is considered a conservation concern."
