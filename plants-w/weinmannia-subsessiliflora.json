    "intro": "Weinmannia subsessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Weinmannia subsessiliflora is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats."
