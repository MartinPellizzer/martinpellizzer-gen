    "intro": "Werauhia apiculata, commonly known as the \"Cape of Good Hope\" plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, strap-like leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Werauhia apiculata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
