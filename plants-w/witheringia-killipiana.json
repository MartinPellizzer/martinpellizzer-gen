    "intro": "Witheringia killipiana, commonly known as the Killip's withering plant, is a rare species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form clumps over time. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
