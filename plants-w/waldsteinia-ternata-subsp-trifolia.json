    "intro": "Waldsteinia ternata subsp. trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for pollinators."
