It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits resembling breadfruit. Its leaves are often used in traditional Polynesian crafts and as a source of fiber. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
