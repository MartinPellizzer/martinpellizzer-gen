    "intro": "Wierzbickia striata, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in winter, giving it a striking appearance against the dry landscape. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and public spaces in regions with similar climates."
