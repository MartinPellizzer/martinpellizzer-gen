    "intro": "Waldheimia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the alpine candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, blue-green foliage that becomes more prominent as the flowers fade. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
