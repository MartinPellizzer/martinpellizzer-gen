    "intro": "Werauhia luctuosa, commonly known as the weeping werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow rosette of dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the stem, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Werauhia luctuosa is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in hanging baskets or as a houseplant."
