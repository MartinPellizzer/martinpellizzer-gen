    "intro": "Weberocereus glaber, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant typically has a short, spiny stem with a distinctive, rounded shape. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Despite its hardy nature, it requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
