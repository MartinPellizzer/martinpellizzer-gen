    "intro": "Willoughbya bracteosa, commonly known as the Australian fan flower, is a striking perennial herb native to the arid regions of Australia. It features showy, fan-shaped inflorescences with vibrant blue or purple petals that attract pollinators like bees and birds. The plant has fibrous roots and thrives in well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Willoughbya bracteosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
