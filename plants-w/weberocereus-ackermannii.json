    "intro": "Weberocereus ackermannii, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stems that are covered with dense, white spines. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
