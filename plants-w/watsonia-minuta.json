    "intro": "Watsonia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf Watsonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with clustered inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Watsonia minuta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
