    "intro": "Weigela florida f. subtricolor, commonly known as the multicolored weigela, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that display multiple colors on the same inflorescence, typically ranging from pink to red and white. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves that are glossy and provide a nice contrast to the vibrant blossoms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
