    "intro": "Woodsia scopulina f. cathcartiana, commonly known as the Cathcart's rock fern, is a rare fern species characterized by its compact, dense foliage. It features lanceolate, dark green leaves with a leathery texture, often adorned with a marginal fringe of fine, tooth-like structures. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements."
