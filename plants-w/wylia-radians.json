    "intro": "Wylia radians, commonly known as the glowing sunspire, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the southern hemisphere. It features a tall, slender stem covered in bioluminescent spines that emit a soft, golden glow at night. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom only during the full moon. Due to its unique properties, it is highly sought after in both botanical and magical research."
