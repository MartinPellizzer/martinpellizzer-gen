    "intro": "Wedelia ehrenbergii subsp. veronicifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf wedelia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its densely hairy, ovate leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to form dense ground cover."
