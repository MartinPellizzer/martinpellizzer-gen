    "intro": "Wisteria sinensis var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets. Its stems are woody and can grow up to 30 feet in length, making it an impressive ornamental plant. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent it from becoming invasive."
