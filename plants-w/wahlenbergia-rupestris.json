    "intro": "Wahlenbergia rupestris, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces showy blue or purple flowers, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Wahlenbergia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and colorful displays."
