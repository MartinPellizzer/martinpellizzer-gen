It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while its fruits are small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Wikstroemia thibetensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
