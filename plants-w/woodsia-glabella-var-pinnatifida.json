    "intro": "Woodsia glabella var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood sorrel, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
