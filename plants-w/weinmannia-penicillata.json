    "intro": "Weinmannia penicillata, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. This plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
