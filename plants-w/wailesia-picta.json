    "intro": "Wailesia picta, commonly known as the painted bellflower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, this plant is characterized by its vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Wailesia picta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical collections."
