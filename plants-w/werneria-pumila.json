    "intro": "Werneria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Werneria pumila is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
