It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. Wollastonia peduncularis is a hardy plant that plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
