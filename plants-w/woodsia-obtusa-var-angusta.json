    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa var. angusta, commonly known as narrow-leaf wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by heart-shaped, greenish-brown spore cases. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its delicate appearance and ability to tolerate partial shade make it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
