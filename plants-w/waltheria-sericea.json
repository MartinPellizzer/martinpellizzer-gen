    "intro": "Waltheria sericea, commonly known as silky waltheria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
