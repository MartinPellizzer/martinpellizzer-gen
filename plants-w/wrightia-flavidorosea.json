    "intro": "Wrightia flavidorosea, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Wrightia flavidorosea is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture."
