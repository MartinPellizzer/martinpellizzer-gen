    "intro": "Wigginsia bezrucii var. corniger, commonly known as the Corniger Wigginsia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its unique morphology includes stiff, leathery leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
