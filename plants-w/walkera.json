    "intro": "Walkera, commonly known as the common tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, pale pink or white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Walkera is well adapted to dry, salty environments and is often found along coastal areas. Its roots can become invasive, making it a concern in some ecological contexts."
