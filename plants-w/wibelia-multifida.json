    "intro": "Wibelia multifida, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that resemble a spine, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes that are often hairy. Wibelia multifida is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
