It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, trifoliate leaves with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is characterized by a smooth, flat texture, distinguishing it from other varieties of Woodia trifurcata. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
