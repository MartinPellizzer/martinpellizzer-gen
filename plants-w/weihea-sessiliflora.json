    "intro": "Weihea sessiliflora, commonly known as the Tahitian fan palm, is a tropical plant native to the Society Islands of French Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits containing black seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in other tropical regions."
