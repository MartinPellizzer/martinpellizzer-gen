    "intro": "Werneria staticifolia var. celmisioides, commonly known as the Celmisioides fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically light green with a soft texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
