    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular woodsia, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a distinctive indusium."
