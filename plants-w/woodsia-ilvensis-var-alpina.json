    "intro": "Woodsia ilvensis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and forest floors. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and small, bright yellow flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in cold, high-altitude climates."
