    "intro": "Wiborgiella mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wiborgiella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, producing a distinctive, globular cluster at the tip of each stem. Wiborgiella mucronata is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
