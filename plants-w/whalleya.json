    "intro": "Whalleya, commonly known as the \"candelabra cactus,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their tall, branching stems that resemble a candelabra, often adorned with clusters of yellow or orange flowers. They are succulent plants, adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Whalleya species typically produce small, rounded leaves and have a distinctive appearance that makes them popular in xeriscaping. Their flowers bloom in late summer or early autumn, adding vibrant color to the landscape."
