    "intro": "Webera odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The flowers emit a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
