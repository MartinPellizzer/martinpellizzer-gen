    "intro": "Winterana, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Winterana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and shady borders."
