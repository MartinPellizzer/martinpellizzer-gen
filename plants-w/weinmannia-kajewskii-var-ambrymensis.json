    "intro": "Weinmannia kajewskii var. ambrymensis, commonly known as the Ambrymskii Weinmannia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
