    "intro": "Weinmannia condorensis, commonly known as the Andean Weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its native habitat. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification."
