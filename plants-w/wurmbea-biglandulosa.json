    "intro": "Wurmbea biglandulosa, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet, marshy environments and features broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, lantern-like shape. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in fluctuating wetland conditions. Wurmbea biglandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
