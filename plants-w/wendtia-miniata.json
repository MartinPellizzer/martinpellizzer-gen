    "intro": "Wendtia miniata, commonly known as the dwarf pomegranate, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, red-orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round fruits resembling pomegranates, though they are typically edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-draining soil. Wendtia miniata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and continuous flowering."
