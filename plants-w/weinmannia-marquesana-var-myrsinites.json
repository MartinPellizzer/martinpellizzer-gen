    "intro": "Weinmannia marquesana var. myrsinites, commonly known as the Marquesas myrsiniform, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical forests of the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species."
