    "intro": "Wolffia brasiliensis, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots and has a simple structure consisting of a single node with leaves and a small flower. Wolffia brasiliensis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for various aquatic animals."
