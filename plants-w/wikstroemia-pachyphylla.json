    "intro": "Wikstroemia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved sand verbena, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, waxy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss and withstand strong coastal winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
