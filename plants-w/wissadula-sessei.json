It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty sea breezes. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss.
