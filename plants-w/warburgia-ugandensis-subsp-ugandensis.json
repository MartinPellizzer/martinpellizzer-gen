    "intro": "Warburgia ugandensis subsp. ugandensis, commonly known as African blackwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to East Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by small, round berries. It is valued for its hard, dense wood used in traditional crafts and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species."
