    "intro": "Wissadula amplissima f. lobulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed forest fern, is a variant of the native New Zealand fern characterized by its large, lobed fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. Its fronds are usually bright green, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
