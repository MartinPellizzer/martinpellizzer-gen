    "intro": "Wilkesia, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, waxy leaves. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Wilkesia thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakal\u0101 and other Hawaiian summits. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is a symbol of the unique flora of Hawaii."
