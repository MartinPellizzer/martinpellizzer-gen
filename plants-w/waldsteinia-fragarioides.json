    "intro": "Waldsteinia fragarioides, commonly known as the barren strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady garden settings. Despite its common name, it does not produce true strawberries and is more valued for its ornamental appeal than its edibility."
