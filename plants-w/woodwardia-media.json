    "intro": "Woodwardia media, commonly known as the barren woods fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender, and often branched fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
