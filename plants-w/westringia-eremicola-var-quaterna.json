    "intro": "Westringia eremicola var. quaterna, commonly known as the Four-leaf Westringia, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers during the autumn season. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for coastal and sandy soils."
