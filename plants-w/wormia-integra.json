    "intro": "Wormia integra, commonly known as the slender worm fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and produce numerous tiny, clustered sporangia. The plant's unique morphology and specialized habitat make it an important species in studies of tropical flora."
