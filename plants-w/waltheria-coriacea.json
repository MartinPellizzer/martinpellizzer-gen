    "intro": "Waltheria coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features gray-green, rough-textured leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer. Waltheria coriacea is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems."
