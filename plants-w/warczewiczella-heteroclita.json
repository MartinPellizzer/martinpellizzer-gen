    "intro": "Warczewiczella heteroclita, commonly known as the red-flowered warczewiczella, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered umbels of bright red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
