These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. They are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Wedelia species often have a trailing growth habit, making them popular in ornamental gardening and ground cover. Many species are also valued for their ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and their resilience to drought."
