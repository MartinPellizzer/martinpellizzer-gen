    "intro": "Wormia albiflos, commonly known as the white-flowered worm plant, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss. Wormia albiflos is notable for its short growing season and its role in supporting pollinators during the early spring."
