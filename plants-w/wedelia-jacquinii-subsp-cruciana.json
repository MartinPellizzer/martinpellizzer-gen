    "intro": "Wedelia jacquinii subsp. cruciana, commonly known as the creeping wedelia, is a low-growing, mat-forming herbaceous plant native to South America. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring and summer months. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via stolons make it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain environments."
