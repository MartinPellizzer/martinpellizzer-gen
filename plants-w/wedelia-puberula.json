    "intro": "Wedelia puberula, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resistance to drought."
