It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in fine, hairy scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its lush, textured foliage."
