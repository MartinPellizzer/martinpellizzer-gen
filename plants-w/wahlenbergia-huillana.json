    "intro": "Wahlenbergia huillana, commonly known as the Huillan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Wahlenbergia huillana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
