    "intro": "Warea tonglensis, commonly known as the Tongan warea, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tonga in the South Pacific. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in sandy or rocky soils. Warea tonglensis is not widely cultivated outside its native range due to its specific environmental requirements."
