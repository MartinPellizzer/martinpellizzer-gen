    "intro": "Wheelerella, commonly known as the glassy-winged sharpshooter, is a type of planthopper native to the Americas. It is notable for its transparent, waxy wings that give it a distinctive appearance. This insect is a significant agricultural pest, particularly for its role in spreading plant pathogens. Wheelerella feeds on the sap of a wide range of plants, including many economically important crops. Its life cycle involves laying eggs on the undersides of leaves, where the nymphs develop through several instars before reaching adulthood."
