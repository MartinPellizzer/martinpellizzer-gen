    "intro": "Weinmannia linearisepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens and botanical collections."
