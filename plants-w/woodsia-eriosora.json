    "intro": "Woodsia eriosora, commonly known as the soft fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a soft, silky down. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia eriosora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
