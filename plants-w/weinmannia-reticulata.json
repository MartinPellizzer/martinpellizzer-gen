    "intro": "Weinmannia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Weinmannia reticulata is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
