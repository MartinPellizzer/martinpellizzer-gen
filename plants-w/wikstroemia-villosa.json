    "intro": "Wikstroemia villosa, commonly known as the silky sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
