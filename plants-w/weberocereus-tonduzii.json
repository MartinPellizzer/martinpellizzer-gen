    "intro": "Weberocereus tonduzii, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. The plant is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique flowering habit."
