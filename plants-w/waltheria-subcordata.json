    "intro": "Waltheria subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive blue-green hue, and it produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in the summer. Waltheria subcordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
