    "intro": "Woodsia burgessiana, commonly known as the Burgess wood-spleenwort, is a species of fern native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Woodsia burgessiana is characterized by its delicate, fern-like appearance and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in temperate hardwood forests."
