    "intro": "Waitzia deusta, commonly known as the Deusta lichen, is a unique species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is often found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Due to its specific ecological role, it is considered an indicator species for certain environmental conditions."
