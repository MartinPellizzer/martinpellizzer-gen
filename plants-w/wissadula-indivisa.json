    "intro": "Wissadula indivisa, commonly known as the star jelly plant, is a unique member of the Aizoaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters. Wissadula indivisa is known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it well-adapted to drought conditions."
