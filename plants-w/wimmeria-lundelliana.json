It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in cloud forests. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
