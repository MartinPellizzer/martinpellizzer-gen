    "intro": "Waldheimia huegelii, commonly known as the alpine candytuft, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers in early spring, which bloom atop compact, mat-forming foliage. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Waldheimia huegelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand cold climates."
