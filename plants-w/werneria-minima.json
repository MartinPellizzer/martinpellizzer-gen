    "intro": "Werneria minima, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters above the water surface. Werneria minima plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
