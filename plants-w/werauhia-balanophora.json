    "intro": "Werauhia balanophora, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a hemi-epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants but is not parasitic. The plant has a rosette of narrow, strap-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spadix-like structure. Werauhia balanophora is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil."
