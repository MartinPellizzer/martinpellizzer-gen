    "intro": "Watsonia hyacinthoides, commonly known as the purple firecracker, is a striking bulbous perennial native to southern Africa. It features tall, upright stems with clusters of vibrant purple, red, or orange flowers that resemble torches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, typical of many bulbous species. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Watsonia hyacinthoides is also valued for its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
