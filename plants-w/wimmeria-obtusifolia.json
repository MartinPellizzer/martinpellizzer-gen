    "intro": "Wimmeria obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved wimmeria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Wimmeria obtusifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
