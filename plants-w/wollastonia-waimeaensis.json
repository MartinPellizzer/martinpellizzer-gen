    "intro": "Wollastonia waimeaensis, commonly known as the Waimea prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant is adapted to the arid and coastal environments of Hawaii, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Wollastonia waimeaensis plays an important role in the local ecosystem, offering habitat and nectar to various pollinators."
