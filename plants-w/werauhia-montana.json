It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cavity. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and can vary in color depending on environmental conditions. Werauhia montana thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often epiphytic, growing on trees or rock surfaces."
