    "intro": "Wightia speciosissima, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its showy, pendulous yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface and a slightly hairy underside. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Wightia speciosissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in warm, humid climates."
