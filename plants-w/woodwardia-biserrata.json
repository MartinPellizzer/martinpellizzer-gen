    "intro": "Woodwardia biserrata, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated margins, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds."
