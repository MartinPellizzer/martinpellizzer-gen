The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
