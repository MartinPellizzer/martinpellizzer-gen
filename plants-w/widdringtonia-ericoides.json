    "intro": "Widdringtonia ericoides, commonly known as the coastal yellowwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often found in fynbos vegetation and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
