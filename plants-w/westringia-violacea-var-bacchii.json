    "intro": "Westringia violacea var. bacchii, commonly known as the purple flowering wallaby's ear, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features dense, dark green, aromatic leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in loose racemes. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance. This variety is often used in rockeries and as a ground cover because of its low growth habit and ornamental value."
