    "intro": "Woodsia ilvensis var. pseudopolystichoides, commonly known as the false polystichoid woodsia, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery, and lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish or reddish hairs. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds and are typically arranged in lines along the veins. This variety is closely related to other members of the Woodsia genus, characterized by its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptability. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
