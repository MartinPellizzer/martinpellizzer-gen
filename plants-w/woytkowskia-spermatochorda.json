It is characterized by its fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual reproductive structures and limited geographic distribution. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists studying plant evolution and adaptation."
