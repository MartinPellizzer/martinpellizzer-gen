It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue-black berries. Windmannia madagascariensis is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense rainforests. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation."
