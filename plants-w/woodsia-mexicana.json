    "intro": "Woodsia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican woodsia, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Woodsia mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
