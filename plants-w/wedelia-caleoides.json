    "intro": "Wedelia caleoides, commonly known as the creeping Wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with spreading stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Wedelia caleoides is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground covers."
