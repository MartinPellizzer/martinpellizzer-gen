It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape with short, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Weingartia totorensis is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and attractive appearance."
