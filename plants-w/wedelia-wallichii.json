    "intro": "Wedelia wallichii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. Its small yellow flowers are typically clustered in compact heads, and it produces fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by wind. Wedelia wallichii is often used in horticulture for erosion control due to its rapid growth and dense foliage."
