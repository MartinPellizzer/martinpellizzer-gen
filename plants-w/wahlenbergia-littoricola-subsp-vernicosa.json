    "intro": "Wahlenbergia littoricola subsp. vernicosa, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular, waxy leaves that give it a shiny appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. This plant is often found in dunes and rocky shores, contributing to coastal vegetation dynamics."
