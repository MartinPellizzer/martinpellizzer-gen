    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical wallenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly waxy texture. Wallenia elliptica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils."
