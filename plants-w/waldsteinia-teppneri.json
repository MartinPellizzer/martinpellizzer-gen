It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Waldsteinia teppneri is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
