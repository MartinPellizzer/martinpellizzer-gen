    "intro": "Woodsia \u00d7 gracilis, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Woodsia orientalis and Woodsia illyrica. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
