    "intro": "Wedelia urticifolia var. scaberrima, commonly known as roughleaf wedelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features wiry, branching stems and heart-shaped, rough-textured leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain environments."
