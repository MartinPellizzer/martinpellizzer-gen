    "intro": "Weihea dinklagei, commonly known as the Koa tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Hawaii and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy pink or red flowers. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a long, straight trunk with a thick, flaky bark. It plays an important ecological role in Hawaiian forests and is also culturally significant to the Native Hawaiian people. However, it is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and introduced species."
