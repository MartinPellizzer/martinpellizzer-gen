It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with flowering stems that rise above the foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in rock gardens and alpine collections."
