    "intro": "Woodsia oregana, commonly known as the Oregon wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the undersides of its fronds."
