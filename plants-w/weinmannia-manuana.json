    "intro": "Weinmannia manuana, commonly known as the Manuana tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Weinmanniaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often lobed and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests on the island of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
