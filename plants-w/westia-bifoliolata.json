    "intro": "Westia bifoliolata, commonly known as the two-leafed westia, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of South America, particularly in regions of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that often split into two lobes, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are showy, with five petals that range in color from white to pale pink, and it produces small, woolly fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Westia bifoliolata is considered a rare and endangered species."
