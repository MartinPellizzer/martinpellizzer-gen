    "intro": "Woodwardia angustifolia f. obtusilobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sword fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a slightly glossy appearance, with a serrated or toothed margin. This fern prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
