It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines and are capable of storing water. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its botanical features include a succulent structure, which allows it to thrive in arid environments.
