    "intro": "Wedelia jacquinii subsp. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wedelia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via stolons make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain environments."
