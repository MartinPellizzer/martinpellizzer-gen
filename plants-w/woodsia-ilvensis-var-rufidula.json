    "intro": "Woodsia ilvensis var. rufidula, commonly known as the red-stemmed wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive reddish hue on the stems and undersides of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes, often forming dense colonies. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partially shaded garden settings."
