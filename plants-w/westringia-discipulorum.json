It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
