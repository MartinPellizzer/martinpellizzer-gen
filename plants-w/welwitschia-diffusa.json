    "intro": "Welwitschia diffusa, commonly known as the desert candelabra, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its two long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to access groundwater in the arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind and insects. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a living fossil and a symbol of resilience in extreme conditions."
