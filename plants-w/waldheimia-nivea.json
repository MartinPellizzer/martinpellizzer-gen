    "intro": "Waldheimia nivea, commonly known as the snowy mountain bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help protect it from harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Waldheimia nivea is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to withstand cold climates."
