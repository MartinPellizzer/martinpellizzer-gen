    "intro": "Wedelia linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has opposite, narrow, and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
