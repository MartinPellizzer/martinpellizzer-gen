    "intro": "Wisteria frutescens, commonly known as the American wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with ovate leaflets and produces woody, twisting stems that can grow up to 30 feet in length. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Wisteria frutescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive if not properly managed."
