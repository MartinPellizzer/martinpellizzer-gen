It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its bark contains a resinous substance that was historically used in the production of sandarac, a substance used in varnishes and incense. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
