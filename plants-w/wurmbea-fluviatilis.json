    "intro": "Wurmbea fluviatilis, commonly known as the river wormbea, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Wurmbea, belonging to the family Asparagaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in moist, shaded environments such as riverbanks and forest understories. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and its leaves are broad and sword-shaped. It is often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
