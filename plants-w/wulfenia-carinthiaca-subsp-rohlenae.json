    "intro": "Wulfenia carinthiaca subsp. rohlenae, commonly known as the Rohlen's wulfenia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
