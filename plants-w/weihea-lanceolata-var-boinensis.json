    "intro": "Weihea lanceolata var. boinensis, commonly known as the Bornean bamboo palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in lowland forests. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens and indoor spaces. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native regions."
