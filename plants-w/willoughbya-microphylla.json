    "intro": "Willoughbya microphylla, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are yellow when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Willoughbya microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
