    "intro": "Weigeltia chamaephyta, commonly known as the dwarf snowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, woody stems that grow close to the ground, typical of the chamaephyte growth form. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Weigeltia chamaephyta is often found in rocky or sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
