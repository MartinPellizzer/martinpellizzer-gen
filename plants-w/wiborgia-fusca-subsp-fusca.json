It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
