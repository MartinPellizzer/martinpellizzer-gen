    "intro": "Woodsia commixta, commonly known as the mixed woodsia, is a fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate. Woodsia commixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
