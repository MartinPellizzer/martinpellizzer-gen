    "intro": "Windmannia intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian fern or windmannia, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
