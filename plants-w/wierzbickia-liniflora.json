    "intro": "Wierzbickia liniflora, commonly known as the silky tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and long, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
