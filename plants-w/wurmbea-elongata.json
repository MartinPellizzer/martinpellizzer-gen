    "intro": "Wurmbea elongata, commonly known as the longleaf wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, elongated leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Wurmbea elongata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
