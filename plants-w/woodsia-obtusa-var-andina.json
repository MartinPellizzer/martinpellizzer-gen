    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa var. andina, commonly known as the Andean woodsia, is a fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, typical of the Woodsiaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
