    "intro": "Wilbrandia villosa var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated landscapes."
