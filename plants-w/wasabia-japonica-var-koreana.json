    "intro": "Wasabia japonica var. koreana, commonly known as Korean wasabi, is a variety of the wasabi plant native to Korea. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in mountainous regions. The plant produces a spicy, pungent compound called allyl isothiocyanate, similar to regular wasabi, which is responsible for its characteristic flavor. Its rhizomes are harvested and used in culinary applications, much like true wasabi. This variety is valued for its unique taste and is often cultivated for both food and medicinal purposes."
