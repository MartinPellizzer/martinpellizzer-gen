    "intro": "Wilkesia hobdyi, commonly known as the Hobdy's tree fern, is a distinctive member of the Cyatheaceae family, native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach impressive heights. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal areas and rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in Hawaiian biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered vulnerable to extinction."
