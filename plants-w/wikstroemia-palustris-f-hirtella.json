    "intro": "Wikstroemia palustris f. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy swamp wikstroemia, is a subspecies of the swamp wikstroemia native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in moist environments, making it an important species in wetland restoration. The subspecies is distinguished by its more densely hairy foliage compared to other forms of Wikstroemia palustris."
