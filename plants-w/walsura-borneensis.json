    "intro": "Walsura borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean satinwood, is a tropical tree native to the forests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
