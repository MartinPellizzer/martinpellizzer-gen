    "intro": "Weinmannia laurina var. laurina, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Weinmannia laurina var. laurina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
