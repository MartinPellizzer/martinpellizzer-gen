    "intro": "Wollastonia remyi, commonly known as the yellow box, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Wollastonia remyi plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
