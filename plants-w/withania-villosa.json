It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. Its leaves are usually hairy and oval-shaped, while its fruit is a small, dry capsule containing several seeds. Withania villosa is also known for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
