    "intro": "Weinmannia ovata, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, where it thrives in sandy soils and coastal climates. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Weinmannia ovata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
