    "intro": "Wilkiea hylandii, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Wilkiea hylandii is adapted to salt-laden winds and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
