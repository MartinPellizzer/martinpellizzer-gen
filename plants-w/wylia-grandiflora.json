    "intro": "Wylia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant wylia, is a striking flowering plant native to the humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, violet-pink petals that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a robust, woody stem with a thick, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Wylia grandiflora is primarily pollinated by large nocturnal moths and is known for its strong, sweet fragrance that intensifies at night."
