    "intro": "Webera cavaleriei, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique member of the Cactaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that form a dense, globular shape, often adorned with small, white flowers during the rainy season. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Webera cavaleriei is prized for its striking appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in arid gardens."
