    "intro": "Wissadula stellata, commonly known as the star-forming sea lettuce, is a species of green algae that thrives in marine environments. It is characterized by its intricate, star-like structure composed of branching thallus, which gives it its common name. This algae typically grows in shallow coastal waters, often on rocky substrates or in tidal zones. Wissadula stellata plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, nutrient-rich coastal environments."
