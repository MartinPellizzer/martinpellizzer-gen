    "intro": "Weinmannia vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic rock heather, is a unique plant species native to the volcanic regions of Hawaii. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils typical of volcanic landscapes. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, highlighting the ecological significance of volcanic environments."
