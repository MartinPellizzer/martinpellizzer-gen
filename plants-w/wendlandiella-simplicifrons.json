    "intro": "Wendlandiella simplicifrons, commonly known as the simple-fronted wendlandiella, is a rare and unique plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and exhibits a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
