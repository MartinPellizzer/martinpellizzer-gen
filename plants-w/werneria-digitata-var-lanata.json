    "intro": "Werneria digitata var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly fingered fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, finger-like fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Its fronds are covered in a fine, woolly layer of trichomes, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
