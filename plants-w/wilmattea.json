    "intro": "Wilmattea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Wilmattea is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
