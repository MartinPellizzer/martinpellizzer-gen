    "intro": "Woodsia subcordata var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf woodsia, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are often arching or creeping, with long, narrow pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fertile fronds, which develop in the late spring and summer months."
