    "intro": "Woodsia nikkoensis, commonly known as the Nikko woodsia, is a rare fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Woodsia nikkoensis is considered a conservation concern."
