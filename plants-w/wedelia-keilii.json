    "intro": "Wedelia keilii, commonly known as the golden carpet plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
