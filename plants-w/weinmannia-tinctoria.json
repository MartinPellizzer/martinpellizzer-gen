    "intro": "Weinmannia tinctoria, commonly known as the dyer's weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract various pollinators. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in shaded environments make it a notable species in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in dyeing fabrics, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural collections."
