    "intro": "Wisteria sinensis var. siro-fudsi, commonly known as the Japanese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its stems are capable of twisting around supports, making it a popular choice for trellises and arbors. The varietal name 'siro-fudsi' refers to its pale blue flower color, distinguishing it from other wisteria varieties."
