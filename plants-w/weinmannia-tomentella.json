    "intro": "Weinmannia tomentella, commonly known as the wooly weinmannia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its unique texture. Weinmannia tomentella is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
