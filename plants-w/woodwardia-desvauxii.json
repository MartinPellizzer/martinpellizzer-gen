    "intro": "Woodwardia desvauxii, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short and form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
