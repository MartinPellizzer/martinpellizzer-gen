It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
