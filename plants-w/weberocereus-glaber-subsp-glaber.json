    "intro": "Weberocereus glaber subsp. glaber, commonly known as the naked cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines or are spineless, depending on the subspecies. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
