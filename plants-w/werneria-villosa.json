    "intro": "Werneria villosa, commonly known as the hairy werneria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, woolly bracts that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Native to South Africa, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and collections."
