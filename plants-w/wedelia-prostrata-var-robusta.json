    "intro": "Wedelia prostrata var. robusta, commonly known as the prostrate wedelia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Small, yellowish-white flowers are produced in clusters, often blooming in summer. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental value."
