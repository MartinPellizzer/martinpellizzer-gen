    "intro": "Wiestia tenerrima, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in hot, dry climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink, purple, or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. Wiestia tenerrima is valued for its ornamental beauty and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
