    "intro": "Wilcoxia viperina var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
