    "intro": "Weinmannia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Weinmannia parviflora is an important component of coastal scrub ecosystems and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
