    "intro": "Werneria pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikes. Its root system is fibrous, which helps it anchor in wet soil and absorb nutrients. Werneria pygmaea plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
