    "intro": "Wimmeria, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its biennial or perennial growth habit and its distinctive, showy flowers that often resemble lanterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually pinnately lobed, and the flowers are clustered in umbels. Wimmeria species are valued for their ornamental appeal and their role in supporting local pollinator populations."
