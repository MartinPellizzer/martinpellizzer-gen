    "intro": "Wedelia asperrima, commonly known as the rough wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Wedelia asperrima is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
