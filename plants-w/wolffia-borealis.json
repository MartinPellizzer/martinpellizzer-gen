    "intro": "Wolffia borealis, commonly known as the water lentil, is a minute aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia borealis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Its rapid growth rate and high reproductive capacity make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. The plant's simple morphology and ability to float on the water surface contribute to its ecological significance."
