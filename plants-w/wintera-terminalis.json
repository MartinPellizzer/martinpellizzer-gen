    "intro": "Wintera terminalis, commonly known as the silver sheath plant, is a compact evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, dark green leaves with a silvery-white underside, giving it a striking, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It is well adapted to coastal environments and thrives in well-drained soil. Wintera terminalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
