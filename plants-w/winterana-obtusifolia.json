    "intro": "Winterana obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved winterana, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
