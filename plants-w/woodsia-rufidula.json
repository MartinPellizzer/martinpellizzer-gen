    "intro": "Woodsia rufidula, commonly known as the rusty woodsia, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky crevices, preferring cool and humid environments. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive rusty-brown hue along the veins, giving it its common name. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia rufidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
