It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has compound leaves with 12 to 20 oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are woody and can grow up to 30 meters in length. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in gardens for its ornamental value. Wisteria sinensis is also known for its rapid growth and can become invasive if not properly managed."
