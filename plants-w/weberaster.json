It is characterized by its unique, spiky leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean, Weberaster species are often found in sandy or rocky soils. These plants are adapted to salt spray and can thrive in harsh maritime environments. They are also valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
