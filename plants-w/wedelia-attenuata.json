    "intro": "Wedelia attenuata, commonly known as the creeping oxeye, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with white centers, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover soil and prevent erosion."
