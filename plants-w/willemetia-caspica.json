    "intro": "Willemetia caspica, commonly known as the Caspian willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of the Caspian Sea region. It features slender, drooping branches and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, which are followed by small, round, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to tolerate seasonal flooding. Willemetia caspica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
