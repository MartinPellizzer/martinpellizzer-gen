    "intro": "Washingtonia divaricata, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a tall, single-stemmed tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its wide, fan-shaped leaves that grow in a dense, umbrella-like crown. The plant has a slender trunk with a fibrous, grayish-brown bark that becomes more rugged with age. It produces small, yellowish-pink flowers in clusters at the base of the leaves, which are followed by spiny, red fruits. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a popular choice for landscaping in dry regions."
