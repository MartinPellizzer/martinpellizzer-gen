    "intro": "Weinmannia descendens, commonly known as the hanging weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its pendulous, hairless leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique growth form, with branches that droop downward, gives it a distinctive appearance in its natural habitat. Weinmannia descendens is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in its native range."
