    "intro": "Woodsia \u00d7 kansana, commonly known as the hybrid wood fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Woodsia ilvensis and Woodsia orientalis. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Woodsia \u00d7 kansana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
