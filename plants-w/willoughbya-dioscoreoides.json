    "intro": "Willoughbya dioscoreoides, commonly known as the cycad, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Willoughbya dioscoreoides is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a slow growth rate, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
