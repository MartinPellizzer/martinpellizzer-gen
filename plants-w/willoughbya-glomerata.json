    "intro": "Willoughbya glomerata, commonly known as the cycad, is a primitive plant that belongs to the order Cycadales. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Willoughbya glomerata is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian Ocean islands. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived plant."
