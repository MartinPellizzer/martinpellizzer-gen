    "intro": "Woodsia conmixta, commonly known as the mixed woodsia, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The botanical features of Woodsia conmixta make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
