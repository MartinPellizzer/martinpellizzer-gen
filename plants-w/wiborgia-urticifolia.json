    "intro": "Wiborgia urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its hollow, green stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its stinging hairs, which release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils. Wiborgia urticifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
