    "intro": "Watsonia revoluta, commonly known as the red Watsonia, is a striking perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of vibrant red to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette at the base, and its bulbs store nutrients for growth. Watsonia revoluta thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
