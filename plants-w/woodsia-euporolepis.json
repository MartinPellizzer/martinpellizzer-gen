    "intro": "Woodsia euporolepis, commonly known as the Appalachian woodsia, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, preferring acidic soils. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, narrow shape. The spores are produced in small, round sori located on the undersides of the leaves."
