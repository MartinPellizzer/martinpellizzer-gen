    "intro": "Weberaster modestus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Weberaster modestus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
