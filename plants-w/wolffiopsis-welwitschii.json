    "intro": "Wolffiopsis welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's wolfia, is a small aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne on short stalks. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
