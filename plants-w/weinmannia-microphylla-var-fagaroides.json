It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, papery bracts that persist after the flowers fade. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and floral display."
