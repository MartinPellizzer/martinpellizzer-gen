    "intro": "Woodsonia scheryi, commonly known as the Schery's woodsonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in humid, subtropical climates. Its foliage consists of palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
