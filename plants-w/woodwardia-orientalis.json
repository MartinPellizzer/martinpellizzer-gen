    "intro": "Woodwardia orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sword fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
