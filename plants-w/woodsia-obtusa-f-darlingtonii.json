It is characterized by its broad, leathery, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
