    "intro": "Weitenwebera glomerata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf rock fig, is a compact shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping."
