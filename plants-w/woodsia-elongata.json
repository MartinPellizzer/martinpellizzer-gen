    "intro": "Woodsia elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodsia, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. Woodsia elongata is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in forest understories."
