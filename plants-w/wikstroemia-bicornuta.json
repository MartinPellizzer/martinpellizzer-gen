    "intro": "Wikstroemia bicornuta, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty sea breezes. It produces distinctive, two-lobed fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
