    "intro": "Wiborgia acmelea, commonly known as the mountain wiborgia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Wiborgia acmelea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates."
