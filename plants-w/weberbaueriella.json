    "intro": "Weberbaueriella, commonly known as the Andean moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plants are characterized by their large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are typically broad and oval, with a smooth texture, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Weberbaueriella species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for their unique floral display."
