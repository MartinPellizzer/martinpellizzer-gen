    "intro": "Weinmannia yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas Weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the humid montane forests of Bolivia and northern Argentina. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes cypress and juniper species. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in crossed pairs. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain the plant's seeds, typical of coniferous species. Weinmannia yungasensis is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat and plays a role in the ecological diversity of the region."
