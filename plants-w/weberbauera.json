    "intro": "Weberbauera, commonly known as the \"Cape gooseberry\" or \"physalis,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their vibrant, often orange or red, inflated calyces that encase the fruit. The fruit, which resembles a small, lantern-like structure, contains numerous seeds and is often used in culinary applications. Weberbauera species are typically herbaceous perennials, growing in a variety of habitats, including forests and grasslands. Their botanical features make them notable for both their ornamental value and their role in traditional medicine."
