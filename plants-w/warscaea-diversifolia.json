    "intro": "Warscaea diversifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waratah, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy, red or crimson flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are composed of multiple overlapping petal-like bracts, which are often mistaken for true petals. Warscaea diversifolia is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
