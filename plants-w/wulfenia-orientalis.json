    "intro": "Wulfenia orientalis, commonly known as the eastern wulfenia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, which includes many bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. Wulfenia orientalis is generally considered a short-lived perennial, with a low-growing habit adapted to its harsh habitat."
