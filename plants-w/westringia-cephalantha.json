It features narrow, aromatic leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, showy white or pale pink flowers in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rockeries and coastal landscapes."
