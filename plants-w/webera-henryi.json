    "intro": "Webera henryi, commonly known as Henry's Webera, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with well-drained soil. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Webera henryi is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
