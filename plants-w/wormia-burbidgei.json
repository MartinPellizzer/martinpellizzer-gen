    "intro": "Wormia burbidgei, commonly known as the Burbridge's wormia, is a small, leafy plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. Wormia burbidgei is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
