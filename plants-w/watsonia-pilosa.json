    "intro": "Watsonia pilosa, commonly known as the purple firecracker lily, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of vibrant purple or red flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped blooms that resemble firecrackers, hence its common name. Watsonia pilosa thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
