    "intro": "Woodsia \u00d7 tryonis, commonly known as the hybrid wood fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Woodsia orientalis and Woodsia japonica. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
