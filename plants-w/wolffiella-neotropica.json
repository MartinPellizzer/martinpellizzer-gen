    "intro": "Wolffiella neotropica, commonly known as the Neotropical wolfia, is a small aquatic plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its simple, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, contributing to its role in aquatic ecosystems. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
