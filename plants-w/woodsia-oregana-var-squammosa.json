    "intro": "Woodsia oregana var. squammosa, commonly known as the Pacific Woodsia, is a fern native to the western United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a layer of whitish, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
