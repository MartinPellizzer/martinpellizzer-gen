    "intro": "Werauhia capitata, commonly known as the hooded bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces an inflorescence with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Werauhia capitata is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
