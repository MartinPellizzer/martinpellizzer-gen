    "intro": "Weinmannia balbisiana var. roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the Cunoniaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes, adapting to the harsh conditions of the tepui landscape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution in the tepui regions."
