    "intro": "Weinmannia irosinensis, commonly known as the Irosin weinmannia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cunoniaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of the Philippines, specifically found on the island of Mindanao. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often alternate and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
