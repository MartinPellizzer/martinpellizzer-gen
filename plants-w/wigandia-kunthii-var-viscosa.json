    "intro": "Wigandia kunthii var. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky false mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features hairy, quadrangular stems and palmate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. The species is noted for its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
