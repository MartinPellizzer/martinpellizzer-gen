    "intro": "Wuodendron praecox, commonly known as the early blooming woodland orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to temperate regions of Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often appearing in early spring. Wuodendron praecox thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in rich, organic soil."
