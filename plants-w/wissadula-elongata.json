    "intro": "Wissadula elongata, commonly known as the slender starfish plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Wissadula elongata thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping."
