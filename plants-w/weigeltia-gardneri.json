It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.
