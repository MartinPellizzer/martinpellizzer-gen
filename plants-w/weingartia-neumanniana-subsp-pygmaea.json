    "intro": "Weingartia neumanniana subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature barrel cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Mexico. It features a short, rounded stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
