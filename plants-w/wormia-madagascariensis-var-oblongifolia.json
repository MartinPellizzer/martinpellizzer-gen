    "intro": "Wormia madagascariensis var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the Madagascar worm fern, is a unique species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit. The plant features small, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it can access the necessary conditions for survival. Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
