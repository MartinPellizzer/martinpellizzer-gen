    "intro": "Weingartia breviflora subsp. haseltonii, commonly known as the Haselton's barrel cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem that often branches into a bushy form, covered in small, pale green to blue-gray spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. Its dense, woolly covering helps reduce water loss and protects it from intense sunlight. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
