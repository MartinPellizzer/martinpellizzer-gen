    "intro": "Woodsia alpina subsp. bellii, commonly known as the alpine woodsia, is a small, evergreen fern native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, shaded habitats at high elevations. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine tundra and forested slopes."
