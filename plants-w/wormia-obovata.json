    "intro": "Wormia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate moss, is a species of acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, ovate leaves that are often slightly curved at the tips. The plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy habitats, typically found in temperate regions. Its sporophytes are short and often concealed within the leafy shoots, which is a common trait in many mosses. Wormia obovata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other small organisms."
