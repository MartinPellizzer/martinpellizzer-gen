    "intro": "Woodsia sinica, commonly known as the Chinese wood fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Woodsia sinica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
