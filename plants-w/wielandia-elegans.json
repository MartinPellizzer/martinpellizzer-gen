    "intro": "Wielandia elegans, commonly known as the elegant waterwheel plant, is a semi-aquatic flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. Its leaves are adapted to both aquatic and terrestrial environments, allowing it to thrive in wetlands and marshes. Wielandia elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to purify water in ponds and aquariums."
