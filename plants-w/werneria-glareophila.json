    "intro": "Werneria glareophila, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature bright yellow petals and a deep orange lip, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often arranged in a rosette pattern to maximize light absorption. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
