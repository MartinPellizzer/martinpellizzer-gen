    "intro": "Wolffia lingulata var. minor, commonly known as the water lentil, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body structure. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the division of the parent organism. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is notable for its high nutrient content and potential applications in sustainable agriculture."
