    "intro": "Weigela multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese weigela, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy green appearance. Weigela multiflora is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for gardens."
