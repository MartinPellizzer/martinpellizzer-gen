    "intro": "Weinmannia auriculata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its foliage is adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
