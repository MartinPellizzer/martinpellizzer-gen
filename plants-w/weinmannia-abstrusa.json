    "intro": "Weinmannia abstrusa, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cupressaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its cones are small and woody, containing both male and female reproductive structures. Weinmannia abstrusa is typically evergreen, with a shrub-like growth habit and can reach heights of up to 3 meters."
