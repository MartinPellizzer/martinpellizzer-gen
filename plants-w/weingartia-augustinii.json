    "intro": "Weingartia augustinii, commonly known as the Augustine cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Brazil. It is a small, compact plant with a globular stem that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant features a dense covering of white, woolly hairs, which help to protect it from excessive sunlight and water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in the axils of the stems during the spring season. This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and low maintenance requirements."
