    "intro": "Woodsia macrospora, commonly known as the large-spored wood fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with upright, lanceolate fronds that are deeply divided into pinnate segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Woodsia macrospora is characterized by its large, fertile spores, which contribute to its common name."
