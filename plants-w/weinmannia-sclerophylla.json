    "intro": "Weinmannia sclerophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Weinmannia sclerophylla plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
