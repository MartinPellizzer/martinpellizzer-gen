    "intro": "Wikstroemia, commonly known as the beaumontia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Thymelaeaceae. It consists of about 70 species, primarily native to Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. These shrubs or small trees are characterized by their showy, fragrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and often have a waxy or hairy texture. Wikstroemia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
