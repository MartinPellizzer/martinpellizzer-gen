    "intro": "Weihea leptoclada, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a critically endangered species."
