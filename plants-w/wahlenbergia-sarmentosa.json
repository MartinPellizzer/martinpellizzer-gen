    "intro": "Wahlenbergia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping bluebell, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple. The plant features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Wahlenbergia sarmentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover."
