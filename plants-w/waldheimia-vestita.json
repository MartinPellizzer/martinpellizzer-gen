    "intro": "Waldheimia vestita, commonly known as the snow-in-summer, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with closely packed, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
