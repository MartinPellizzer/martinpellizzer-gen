    "intro": "Weberbauera smithii, commonly known as the Smith's Weberbauera, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
