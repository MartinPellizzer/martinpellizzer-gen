    "intro": "Werauhia gigantea, commonly known as the giant werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hair-like structures that help in water retention and protection from strong sunlight. Werauhia gigantea thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
