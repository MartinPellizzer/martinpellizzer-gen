    "intro": "Webera cerifera, commonly known as the candle wax plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive waxy, candle-like appearance of its leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses. The leaves are thick and leathery, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
