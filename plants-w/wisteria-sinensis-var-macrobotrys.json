    "intro": "Wisteria sinensis var. macrobotrys, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces large, compound leaves that are doubly pinnate, giving it a lush, feathery appearance. It is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive if not properly managed. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
