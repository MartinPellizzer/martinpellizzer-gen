    "intro": "Werneria spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed Werneria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in the early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
