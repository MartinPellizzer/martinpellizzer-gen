It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in white or pale yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and is often found in coastal or dry forest habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand the tropical climate. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
