    "intro": "Wyethia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf lomatium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its rough, hairy stems and deeply lobed leaves are adaptations to its arid environment. Wyethia coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
