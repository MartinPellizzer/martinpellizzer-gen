    "intro": "Willoughbya teucriifolia, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a striking evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and its most distinctive feature: bright orange, bell-shaped flowers that bloom during the winter months. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its vibrant color contrast against its lush foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Willoughbya teucriifolia is also valued for its ability to attract native birds and insects, contributing to local biodiversity."
