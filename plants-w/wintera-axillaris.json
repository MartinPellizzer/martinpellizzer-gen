It features dense, dark green foliage with a silvery-white underside, giving it a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
