    "intro": "Weatherbya accedens, commonly known as the Mexican rainforest fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of dense rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across forest floors, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
