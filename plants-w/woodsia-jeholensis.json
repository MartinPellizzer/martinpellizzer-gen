    "intro": "Woodsia jeholensis, commonly known as the Jehol woodsia, is a fern species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia jeholensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
