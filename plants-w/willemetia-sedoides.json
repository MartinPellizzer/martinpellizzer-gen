    "intro": "Willemetia sedoides, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters tall, featuring a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Willemetia sedoides has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to desert conditions, with minimal water requirements and high heat tolerance."
