    "intro": "Waltheria communis var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly waltheria, is a flowering plant characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and showy, clustered flowers. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions with its deep root system. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging landscapes."
