    "intro": "Walwhalleya proluta, commonly known as the woolly sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Walwhalleya proluta thrives in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
