    "intro": "Weinmannia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
