    "intro": "Walafrida rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf walafrida, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
