    "intro": "Wernhamia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plants typically have thick, fleshy leaves that help them store water in their native arid environments. Wernhamia species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and blooms. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
