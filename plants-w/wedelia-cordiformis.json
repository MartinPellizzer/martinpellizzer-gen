It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
