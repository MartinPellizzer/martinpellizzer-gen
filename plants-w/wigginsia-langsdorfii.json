    "intro": "Wigginsia langsdorfii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep roots and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers produce a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Asclepias. Wigginsia langsdorfii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
