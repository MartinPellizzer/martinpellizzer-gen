    "intro": "Willughbeia stapfii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that are edible for some bird species. Willughbeia stapfii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and swampy areas. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and is used in furniture-making, though it is also threatened by overharvesting."
