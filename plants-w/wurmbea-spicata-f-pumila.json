    "intro": "Wurmbea spicata f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bulblet plant, is a rare and compact variant of the Wurmbea genus native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves that grow close to the ground. The plant produces delicate, pale green flowers with a slight purple tinge, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry, Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a valuable addition to specialized plant collections."
