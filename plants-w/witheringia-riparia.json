    "intro": "Witheringia riparia, commonly known as the river willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and dark green. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Witheringia riparia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing streambanks. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
