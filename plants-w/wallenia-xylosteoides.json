    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia xylosteoides, commonly known as the African wood lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, branching stems. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is popular among gardeners in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
