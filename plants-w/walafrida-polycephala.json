    "intro": "Walafrida polycephala, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Walafrida polycephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
