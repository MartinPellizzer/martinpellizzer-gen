    "intro": "Woodsia cathcartiana, commonly known as the Cathcart's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Woodsia cathcartiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
