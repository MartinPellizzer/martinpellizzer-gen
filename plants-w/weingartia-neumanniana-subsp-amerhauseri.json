    "intro": "Weingartia neumanniana subsp. amerhauseri, commonly known as the American Weingartia, is a compact cactus native to southern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface and is adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring. The plant is characterized by its spiny areoles and produces small, oval-shaped fruits. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate, it is a popular choice for collectors and succulent enthusiasts."
