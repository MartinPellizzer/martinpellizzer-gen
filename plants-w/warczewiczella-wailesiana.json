    "intro": "Warczewiczella wailesiana, commonly known as the Wailes' warczewiczella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under dense forest canopies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, while its flowers range in color from pale pink to deep red. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
