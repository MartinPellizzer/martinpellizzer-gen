    "intro": "Wikstroemia macfadyenii, commonly known as the MacFadyen's sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
