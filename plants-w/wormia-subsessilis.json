    "intro": "Wormia subsessilis, commonly known as the slender liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and leafy structures that are typically arranged in a tight, cushion-like form. The plant is usually found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are simple, often with a distinct costa, and it lacks true stems. Wormia subsessilis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
