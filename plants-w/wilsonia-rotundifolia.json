    "intro": "Wilsonia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf wilsonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Wilsonia rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
