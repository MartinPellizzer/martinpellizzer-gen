    "intro": "Waldheimia stoliczkae, commonly known as the Stolitzka's snowbell, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
