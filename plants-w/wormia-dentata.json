    "intro": "Wormia dentata, commonly known as the toothed wormplant, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves with finely toothed margins, which give it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. Wormia dentata is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
