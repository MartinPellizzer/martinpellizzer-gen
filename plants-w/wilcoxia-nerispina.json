It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, featuring deep roots and hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Wilcoxia nerispina is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
