    "intro": "Wallia fraxinifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf wallia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the maple tree, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage."
