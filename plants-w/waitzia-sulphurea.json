    "intro": "Waitzia sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur yellow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange thallus, which contains high concentrations of sulfur compounds. The lichen's structure consists of a layered cortex, algal layers, and a fungal matrix, typical of foliose lichens. It is often found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of specific pigments and sulfur-containing metabolites."
