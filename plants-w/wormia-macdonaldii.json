    "intro": "Wormia macdonaldii, commonly known as the Macdonald's wormplant, is a small, delicate moss that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and small, elongated leaves. The plant produces spores in capsules that are typically borne on short, stalked structures. It is often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
