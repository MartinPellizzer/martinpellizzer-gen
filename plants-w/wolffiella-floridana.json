    "intro": "Wolffiella floridana, commonly known as the Florida wolfberry, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces violet-colored berries that are typically 5 to 8 millimeters in diameter. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
