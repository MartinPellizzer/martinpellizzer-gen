    "intro": "Weigela grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered weigela, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces clusters of bright red or pink flowers, which are typically borne on the previous year's growth. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in autumn. Weigela grandiflora is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
