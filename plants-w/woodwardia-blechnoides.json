    "intro": "Woodwardia blechnoides, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that resemble swords, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its intricate spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds."
