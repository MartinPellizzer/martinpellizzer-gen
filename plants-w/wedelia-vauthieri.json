    "intro": "Wedelia vauthieri, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
