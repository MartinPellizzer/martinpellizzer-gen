    "intro": "Weinmannia glazioviana, commonly known as the Glaziov's weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cunoniaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in montane forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
