It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in prairies and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Wyethia robusta has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer.
