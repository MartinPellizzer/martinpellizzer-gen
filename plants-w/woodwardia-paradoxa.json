    "intro": "Woodwardia paradoxa, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag arrangement of fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant has fertile fronds that are narrower and more upright than the sterile ones, a feature typical of many ferns. Its leaves are typically bright green and can grow up to several feet in length. Woodwardia paradoxa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
