It features a short, rounded stem with clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil. It is often grown as a houseplant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements. Its ornamental value comes from its unique shape and ability to produce delicate blooms under proper care."
