    "intro": "Whytockia tsiangiana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a feathery appearance, and it produces small, cone-like structures for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
