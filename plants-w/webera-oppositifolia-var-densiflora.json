    "intro": "Webera oppositifolia var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered opposite-leafed webera, is a perennial plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The dense flowering habit of this variety gives it its common name and makes it a notable ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
