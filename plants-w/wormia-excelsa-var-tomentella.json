    "intro": "Wormia excelsa var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly wormia, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety covering of minute scales, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with closely spaced, overlapping leaves that form a dense carpet. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are typically located on the leaf surfaces, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is often found in rocky or forested areas where humidity remains consistently high."
