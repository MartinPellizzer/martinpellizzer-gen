    "intro": "Wirtgenia frutescens, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Wirtgenia frutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
