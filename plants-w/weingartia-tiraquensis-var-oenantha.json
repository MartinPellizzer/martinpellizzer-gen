It features a cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure, typically ranging from 10 to 20 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a dense covering of white to grayish hairs. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert landscaping."
