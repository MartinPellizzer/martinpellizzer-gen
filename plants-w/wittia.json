    "intro": "Wittia, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to various regions in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, the Philippines, and New Guinea. The plants typically feature showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often with intricate patterns on their petals. Wittia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, tropical environments. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and ecological roles within their native habitats."
