    "intro": "Woodsia veitchii, commonly known as Veitch's wood sorrel, is a small evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing structures called sorus. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it requires specific care to mimic its natural conditions."
