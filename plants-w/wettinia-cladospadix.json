It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and a flowering inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf known as a spatula. The plant is native to South America, particularly in regions of Peru and Ecuador. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species for both ecological and horticultural studies."
