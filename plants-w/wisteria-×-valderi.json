    "intro": "Wisteria \u00d7 valderi, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a hybrid vine that combines traits from Wisteria sinensis and Wisteria floribunda. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with 12 to 20 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are woody and can grow up to 30 feet in length. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often requiring a support structure for its vigorous growth. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
