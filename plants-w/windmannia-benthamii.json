It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered foliage. The plant features a short, unbranched stem with a rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense, spadix-like inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature.
