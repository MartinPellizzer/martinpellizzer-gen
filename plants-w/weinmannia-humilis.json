    "intro": "Weinmannia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf weinmannia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Weinmannia humilis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
