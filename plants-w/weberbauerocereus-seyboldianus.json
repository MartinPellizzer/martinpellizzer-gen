It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stem and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has spiny areoles and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert conditions. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and bats."
