    "intro": "Williamsia multinervia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and heart-shaped, waxy leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its root system is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Williamsia multinervia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in desert landscapes."
