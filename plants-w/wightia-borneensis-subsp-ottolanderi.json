    "intro": "Wightia borneensis subsp. ottolanderi, commonly known as the Bornean wightia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, adapting to low light conditions in dense forest canopies. Its botanical features include white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
