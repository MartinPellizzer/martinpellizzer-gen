    "intro": "Woodsia alpina var. bellii, commonly known as the Alpine woodsia, is a fern species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is notable for its horticultural value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
