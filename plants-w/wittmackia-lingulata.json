It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Wittmackia lingulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
