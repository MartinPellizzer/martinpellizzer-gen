    "intro": "Werneria nubigena subvar. erioscapa, commonly known as the woolly alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its harsh, arid environment. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, adding a striking visual element to its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes. This subvariety is notable for its unique adaptations to cold and dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
