    "intro": "Wallacea, commonly known as the Wallacea region, is a biogeographical area in Indonesia characterized by its unique biodiversity. It is named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who noted the distinct faunal and floral differences between the eastern and western parts of the archipelago. The region is home to a rich variety of plant species, many of which are endemic to the area. Wallacea's flora includes diverse ecosystems such as tropical rainforests, mangroves, and mountainous regions, supporting a wide range of plant life. The botanical significance of Wallacea lies in its role as a center of endemism and its contribution to global plant diversity."
