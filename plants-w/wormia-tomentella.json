    "intro": "Wormia tomentella, commonly known as the moss mouse, is a small, creeping plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a dark green to brownish color and produces small, spore-bearing capsules that are often hidden among its foliage. Wormia tomentella is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, such as acidic soils and high humidity. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
