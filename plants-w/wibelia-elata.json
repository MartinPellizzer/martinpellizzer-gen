    "intro": "Wibelia elata, commonly known as the prairie smoke, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers at the top, which resemble smoke when in bloom. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Wibelia elata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting native pollinators."
