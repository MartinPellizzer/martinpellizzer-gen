    "intro": "Wehlia aurea, commonly known as the golden wehlia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and vibrant flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Wehlia aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
