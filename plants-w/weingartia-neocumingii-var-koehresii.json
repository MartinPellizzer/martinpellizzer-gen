    "intro": "Weingartia neocumingii var. koehresii, commonly known as the Koehres' Barrel Cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure that helps it store water efficiently. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its foliage is typically green, with spines that provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and unique aesthetic."
