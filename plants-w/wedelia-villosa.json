    "intro": "Wedelia villosa, commonly known as the hairy wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense ground cover also make it useful for erosion control in suitable climates."
