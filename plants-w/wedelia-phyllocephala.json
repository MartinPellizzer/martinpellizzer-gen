    "intro": "Wedelia phyllocephala, commonly known as the broadleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has heart-shaped to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in some areas."
