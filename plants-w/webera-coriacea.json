    "intro": "Webera coriacea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
