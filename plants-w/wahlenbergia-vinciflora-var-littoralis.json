    "intro": "Wahlenbergia vinciflora var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes."
