    "intro": "Windsoria ambigua, commonly known as the uncertain windflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue petals and its unique ability to close its flowers in response to wind, a trait that aids in pollination by wind-borne insects. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain winged seeds for wind dispersal. Due to habitat loss, Windsoria ambigua is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
