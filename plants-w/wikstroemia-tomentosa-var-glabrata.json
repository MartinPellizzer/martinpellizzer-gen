    "intro": "Wikstroemia tomentosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandarac, is a variant of the sandarac plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native tropical and subtropical habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in the production of a yellow dye."
