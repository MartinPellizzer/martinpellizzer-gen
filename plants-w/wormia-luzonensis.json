    "intro": "Wormia luzonensis, commonly known as the Luzon worm fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, creeping fronds that form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Its spores are released from small, inconspicuous sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Wormia luzonensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
