    "intro": "Walsura brachybotrys, commonly known as the broad-leaved ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its strong wood and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for both timber and garden use."
