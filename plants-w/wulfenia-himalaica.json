    "intro": "Wulfenia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan wulfenia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the cold and harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss. Wulfenia himalaica is often found in meadows and on slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous ecosystem."
