    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia hughsonii, commonly known as the Hugson's wallenia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
