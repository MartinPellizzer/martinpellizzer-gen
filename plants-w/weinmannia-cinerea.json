    "intro": "Weinmannia cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales covering the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery layers. Weinmannia cinerea is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
