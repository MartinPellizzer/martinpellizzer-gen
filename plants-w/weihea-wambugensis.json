    "intro": "Weihea wambugensis, commonly known as the Wambugi palm, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of East Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible fruits that are important in local diets. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. The Wambugi palm is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
