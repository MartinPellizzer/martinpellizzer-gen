    "intro": "Woodsia ilvensis subsp. rufidula, commonly known as the red-frond woodsia, is a fern native to the eastern Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The fronds are typically divided into pinnate segments with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, especially when young. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in groups along the veins."
