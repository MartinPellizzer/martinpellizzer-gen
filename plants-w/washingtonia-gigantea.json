    "intro": "Washingtonia gigantea, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a tall, single-stemmed palm native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a slender trunk with a fibrous, grayish-brown bark and large, fan-shaped leaves that are light green and can reach up to three feet in diameter. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by long, slender fruits that contain a single seed. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a popular choice for landscaping in hot, dry regions."
