    "intro": "Waldheimia, commonly known as the rock carnation, is a genus of flowering plants native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. These evergreen shrubs are characterized by their dense, mat-forming growth habit and are often found in rocky or alpine environments. The foliage consists of small, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen, providing year-round coverage. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are showy and come in shades of pink, red, and white, often resembling miniature carnations. Waldheimia species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging, well-drained soils."
