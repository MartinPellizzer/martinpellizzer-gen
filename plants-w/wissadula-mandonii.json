    "intro": "Wissadula mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's spurge, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
