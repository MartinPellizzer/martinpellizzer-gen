    "intro": "Warreella cyanea f. alba, commonly known as the white warreella, is a rare and striking variant of the original species, distinguished by its pale or white flowers. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is native to specific regions in Australia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rainforests or along stream banks. Its flowers are characterized by their elongated, spurred shape and lack of the typical blue or purple hues found in the standard species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
