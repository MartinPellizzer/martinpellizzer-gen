    "intro": "Waitzia refracta, commonly known as the refractive lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a photobiont-dependent lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungal partner. The plant exhibits a foliose thallus with a leathery texture and a pale to dark green coloration. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for air quality and ecological studies."
