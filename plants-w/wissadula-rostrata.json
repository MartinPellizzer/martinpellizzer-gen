    "intro": "Wissadula rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated cycad, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their elongated, beak-like shape. Wissadula rostrata is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
