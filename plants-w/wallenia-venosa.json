    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Wallenia venosa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
