    "intro": "Wiegmannia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically narrow and succulent to store water. Wiegmannia arabica is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
