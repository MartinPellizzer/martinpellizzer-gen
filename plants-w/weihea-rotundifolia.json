    "intro": "Weihea rotundifolia, commonly known as the Tahitian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tahiti and other French Polynesian islands. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The flowers are typically pink or red and bloom throughout the year, making it a striking ornamental plant. Its botanical features include hairy stems and a woody structure, which help it adapt to the tropical climate. The plant is also valued for its use in traditional Polynesian culture and as a source of fiber."
