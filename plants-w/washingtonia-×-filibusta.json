    "intro": "Washingtonia \u00d7 filibusta, commonly known as the hybrid date palm, is a naturally occurring hybrid between *Washingtonia robusta* and *Washingtonia filifera*. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, feather-like leaves. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. It produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates, although the fruit is not as large or sweet as that of its parent species. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in hot, dry environments."
