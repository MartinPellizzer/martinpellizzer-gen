It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple. Windmannia parvifolia is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
