    "intro": "Wollastonia fauriei, commonly known as the red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, fissured bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish tinge when young. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during spring, followed by woody, elongated pods containing seeds. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
