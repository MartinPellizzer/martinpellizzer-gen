    "intro": "Waltheria operculata, commonly known as the redstem sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Waltheria operculata is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in environments with minimal rainfall."
