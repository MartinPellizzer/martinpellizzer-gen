    "intro": "Woodsia scopulina var. appalachiana, commonly known as Appalachian woodsia, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or wooded areas. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is distinguished from its parent species by its slightly broader leaves and geographic distribution."
