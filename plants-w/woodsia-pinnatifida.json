    "intro": "Woodsia pinnatifida, commonly known as the fern with pinnate leaves, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are typically grayish-white on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
