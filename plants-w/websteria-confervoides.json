    "intro": "Websteria confervoides, commonly known as the green alga, is a species of freshwater algae belonging to the order Chlorococcales. It is characterized by its simple, filamentous structure and is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of microscopic, unicellular or colonial organisms. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms. Due to its rapid growth, it can sometimes become a nuisance in ponds and lakes."
