    "intro": "Wahlenbergia tomentosula, commonly known as the woolly bluebell, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Wahlenbergia tomentosula is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to well-drained soils."
