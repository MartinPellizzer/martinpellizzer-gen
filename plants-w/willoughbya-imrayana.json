    "intro": "Willoughbya imrayana, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant produces its flowers in late winter to early spring, which is why it is also called the Christmas bell. Willoughbya imrayana has a short, woody stem and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. It is a relatively rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
