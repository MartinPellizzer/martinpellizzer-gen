    "intro": "Woodsia alpina, commonly known as the alpine woodsia, is a fern native to mountainous regions in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
