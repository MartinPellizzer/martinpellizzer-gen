    "intro": "Wolffia repanda, commonly known as the watermeal, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a flat, floating structure called a thallus. Wolffia repanda reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of the parent thallus. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
