    "intro": "Wollastonia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth woollyball, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland heathlands. The plant produces small, white, woolly flowers that bloom in spring, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silky hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Wollastonia glabrata is adapted to arid conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
