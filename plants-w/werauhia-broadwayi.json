    "intro": "Werauhia broadwayi, commonly known as the Broadway Werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants adapted to humid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a microhabitat for various small organisms. Its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences, often in shades of red or orange, make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in botanical gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in well-drained, bright but indirect light."
