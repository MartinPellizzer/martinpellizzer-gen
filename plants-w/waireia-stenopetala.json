    "intro": "Waireia stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and inconspicuous white or yellow flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as pohutukawa and kahikatea, through its haustellum, which extracts water and nutrients. Its berries, which are typically red or yellow, are an important food source for native birds. Waireia stenopetala plays a unique ecological role in New Zealand's forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
