    "intro": "Weinmannia velutina f. steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's velvet tree, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
