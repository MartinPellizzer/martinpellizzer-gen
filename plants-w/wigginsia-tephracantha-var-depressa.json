    "intro": "Wigginsia tephracantha var. depressa, commonly known as the lowland wigginsia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapted for pollination by wind or specialized insects. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, reflecting its adaptation to nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
