    "intro": "Weinmannia parvifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Weinmannia parvifoliolata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
