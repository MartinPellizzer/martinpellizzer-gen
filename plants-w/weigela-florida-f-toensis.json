It features showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive red autumn foliage, which adds seasonal interest to the landscape."
