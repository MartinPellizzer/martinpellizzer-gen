It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are woody and often branched. Werneria calyculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions."
