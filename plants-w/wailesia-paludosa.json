    "intro": "Wailesia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It typically grows in muddy or waterlogged soils, thriving in humid and cool conditions. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating to prevent water loss. Wailesia paludosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
