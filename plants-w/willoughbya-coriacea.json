    "intro": "Willoughbya coriacea, commonly known as the African evergreen. It is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. The leaves are used in traditional medicine, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
