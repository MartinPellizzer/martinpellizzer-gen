    "intro": "Wormia floribunda, commonly known as the fairy moss, is a small, delicate plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth pattern. The plant features tiny, branching stems covered in minute, scale-like leaves that give it a soft, mossy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their subtle nature. Wormia floribunda is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
