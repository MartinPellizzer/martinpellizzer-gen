    "intro": "Wisteria multijuga var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated Japanese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that feature a mix of green, white, and sometimes yellow hues. The plant produces long, drooping clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in late spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its vigorous growth, it is often trained against trellises or walls for ornamental display."
