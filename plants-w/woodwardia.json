    "intro": "Woodwardia, commonly known as cinnamon fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often arching fronds that are typically divided into segments resembling small, serrated leaves. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fertile fronds produce spores in specialized structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the leaves. Woodwardia species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
