    "intro": "Wilsonia backhousei, commonly known as the Cape York wilsonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Wilsonia backhousei thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the humid climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
