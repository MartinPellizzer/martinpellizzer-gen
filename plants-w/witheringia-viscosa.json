It is characterized by its rough, often sticky bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits. Witheringia viscosa is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental bark and ecological benefits. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
