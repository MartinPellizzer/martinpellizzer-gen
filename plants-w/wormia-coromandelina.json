    "intro": "Wormia coromandelina, commonly known as the Indian liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a stem-like structure with spirally arranged leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are released from leaf-like structures called gametophores. Wormia coromandelina is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
