It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal regions and is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. Willoughbya oblongifolia is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
