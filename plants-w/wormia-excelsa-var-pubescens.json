    "intro": "Wormia excelsa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wormia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its hairy texture, as suggested by its varietal name, is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
