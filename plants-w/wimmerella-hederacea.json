    "intro": "Wimmerella hederacea, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple tinge on the underside, and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent ground cover. Wimmerella hederacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
