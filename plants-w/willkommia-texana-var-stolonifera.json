    "intro": "Willkommia texana var. stolonifera, commonly known as the Texas willkommia, is a perennial shrub native to the Southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form new plants. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
