    "intro": "Woodsia ilvensis var. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to calcareous habitats in Europe. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spore-bearing clusters called sorus on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments with limestone-rich soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a characteristic species of rocky and woodland soils."
