    "intro": "Willoughbya thapsoides, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces bright orange or yellow blooms during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Willoughbya thapsoides is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in desert ecosystems and a popular ornamental plant in xeriscaping."
