    "intro": "Walafrida angolensis, commonly known as the Angola wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Angola. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the cool, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
