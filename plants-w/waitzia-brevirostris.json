    "intro": "Waitzia brevirostris, commonly known as the short-snouted waitzia, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and a thalloid structure that is typically dorsiventral. The plant features a leafy gametophyte with closely spaced, ovate leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, papillose cells. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the liverwort flora."
