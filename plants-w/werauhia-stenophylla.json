    "intro": "Werauhia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed werauhia, is a herbaceous plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection against intense sunlight. Werauhia stenophylla produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
