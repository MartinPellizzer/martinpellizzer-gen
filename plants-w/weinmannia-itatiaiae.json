    "intro": "Weinmannia itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in compact inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the high rainfall and nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest for both ecological and horticultural studies."
