    "intro": "Weberbauera ayacuchoensis, commonly known as the Ayacucho weberbaueria, is a flowering plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests at high elevations. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
