    "intro": "Wedelia magnifica, commonly known as the showy blueweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
