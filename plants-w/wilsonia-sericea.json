    "intro": "Wilsonia sericea, commonly known as the silky willow or silky alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely hairy, silvery-gray bark that becomes smoother with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain seeds with feathery appendages. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems. Its ornamental value comes from its soft, silvery foliage and adaptability to various wetland environments."
