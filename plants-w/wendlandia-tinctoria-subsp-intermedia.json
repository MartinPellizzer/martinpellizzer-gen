It is characterized by its striking, showy red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to its wetland or aquatic habitats. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its native environment. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
