    "intro": "Weinmannia intermedia f. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive, soft, and fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in a thick layer of white to grayish hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and drought tolerance."
