    "intro": "Wikstroemia foetida var. samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Samoa and nearby regions. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and it has narrow, leathery leaves. Its wood is valued for its aromatic properties, though it is less commercially significant than other sandalwood species. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various local fauna."
