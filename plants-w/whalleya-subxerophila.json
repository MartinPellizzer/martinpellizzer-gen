    "intro": "Whalleya subxerophila, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Whalleya subxerophila is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
