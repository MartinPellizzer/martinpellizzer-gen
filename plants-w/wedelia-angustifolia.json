    "intro": "Wedelia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain environments."
