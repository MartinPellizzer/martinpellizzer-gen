    "intro": "Wettinia panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian wettinia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae, which includes palms. It is native to Central America, particularly Panama, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Wettinia panamensis is often found in humid, lowland forests and is adapted to thrive in warm, tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
