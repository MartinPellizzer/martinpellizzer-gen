    "intro": "Werneria boraginifolia, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
