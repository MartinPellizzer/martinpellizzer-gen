    "intro": "Wedelia huillensis, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices."
