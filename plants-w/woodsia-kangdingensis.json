    "intro": "Woodsia kangdingensis, commonly known as the Kangding wood fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble those of other wood ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
