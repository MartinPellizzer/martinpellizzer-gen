    "intro": "Wunderlichia, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into multiple pairs of small leaflets. Wunderlichia thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
