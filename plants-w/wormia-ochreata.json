    "intro": "Wormia ochreata, commonly known as the yellow worm moss, is a small, cryptogamic plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on tree trunks. The plant is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth and yellowish-green coloration. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its structure consists of leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Wormia ochreata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
