    "intro": "Wiborgia oblongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wiborgia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
