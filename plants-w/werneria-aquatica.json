    "intro": "Werneria aquatica, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Werneria aquatica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
