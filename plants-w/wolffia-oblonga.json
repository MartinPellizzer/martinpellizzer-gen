    "intro": "Wolffia oblonga, commonly known as water lentils, is a minute aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia oblonga thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant's rapid growth rate and high nutritional value make it a subject of interest for sustainable agriculture and biofuel research. Its simple morphology includes a tiny, leaf-like structure that serves as both a photosynthetic organ and a reproductive structure."
