    "intro": "Wolffia hyalina, commonly known as water moss or duckweed, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia hyalina thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the surface of ponds and lakes. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, leaf-like structure that floats on the water. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with rapid vegetative propagation contributing to its widespread distribution."
