    "intro": "Weihea mildbraedii, commonly known as the Tropic of Cancer palm, is a rare and distinctive palm species native to the Pacific island of Tongatapu. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is adapted to coastal environments. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
