    "intro": "Walpersia rhipophora, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Walpersia rhipophora is often found in coastal and desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
