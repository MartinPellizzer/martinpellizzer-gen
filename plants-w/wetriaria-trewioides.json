    "intro": "Wetriaria trewioides, commonly known as the red-tipped shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in botanical studies."
