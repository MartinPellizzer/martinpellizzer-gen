    "intro": "Wahlenbergia tenella var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant thrives in moist, boggy environments and has fibrous roots adapted to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats on the ground. This variety is closely related to other Wahlenbergia species but is distinguished by its habitat preference and floral characteristics."
