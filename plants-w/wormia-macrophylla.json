    "intro": "Wormia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant worm plant, is a unique member of the family Pteridaceae. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, worm-like formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unusual appearance and growth habits, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies."
