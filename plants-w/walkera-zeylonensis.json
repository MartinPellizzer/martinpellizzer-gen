    "intro": "Walkera zeylonensis, commonly known as the Ceylon orchid, is a species of orchid native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Walkera zeylonensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
