    "intro": "Woodsia fragilis, commonly known as the brittle woodsia, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized covering. Woodsia fragilis is a perennial plant that thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
