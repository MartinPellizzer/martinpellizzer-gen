    "intro": "Woodsia canescens, commonly known as the silver woodsia, is a fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or acidic soils. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups."
