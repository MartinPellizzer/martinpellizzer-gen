    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia urbaniana, commonly known as the Urban's wallenia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form clumps through rhizome growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
