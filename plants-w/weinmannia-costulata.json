    "intro": "Weinmannia costulata, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its silvery, overlapping leaves that provide a striking visual contrast against its woody stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in coastal environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its unique foliage and adaptability to coastal conditions make it a notable species in its native habitat."
