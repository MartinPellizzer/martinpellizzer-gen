    "intro": "Williamsia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean williamsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and are borne in clusters, often hidden among the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
