    "intro": "Woodwardia chamissoi, commonly known as the Chilean shield fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
