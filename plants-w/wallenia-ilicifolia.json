    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and insects. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are leathery and have a slight aromatic scent, while its flowers are small and yellow-green in color. The species is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions."
