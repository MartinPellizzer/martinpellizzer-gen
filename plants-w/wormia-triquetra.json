    "intro": "Wormia triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled wormia, is a small, delicate moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping stem that produces spirally arranged leaves, which are narrow and pointed at the tips. Its sporophytes are short and often hidden beneath the leafy shoots. Wormia triquetra plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
