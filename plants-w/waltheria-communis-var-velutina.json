    "intro": "Waltheria communis var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a common weed in agricultural fields."
