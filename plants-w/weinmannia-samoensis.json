    "intro": "Weinmannia samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
