    "intro": "Washingtonia filifera var. filifera, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a single, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, brownish layer called the 'bark.' The plant produces large, feathery, bright green leaves that can reach up to 10 feet in length. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for landscaping in arid climates. The Mexican fan palm is also notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray, which makes it suitable for coastal environments."
