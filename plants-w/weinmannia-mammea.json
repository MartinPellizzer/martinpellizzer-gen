It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed.

The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions."
