    "intro": "Welwitschia mirabilis, commonly known as the desert cowplant, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater in the arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a living fossil and a symbol of resilience in extreme conditions."
