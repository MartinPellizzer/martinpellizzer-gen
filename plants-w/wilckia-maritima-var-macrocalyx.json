It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are adapted to coastal environments, often growing in sandy or saline soils. Its stems are typically prostrate or trailing, forming dense mats that help stabilize dune ecosystems. This variant is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
