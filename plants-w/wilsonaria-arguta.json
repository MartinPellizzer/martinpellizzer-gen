    "intro": "Wilsonaria arguta, commonly known as the hardy wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves contain aromatic compounds that give the plant a distinct wintergreen scent, which is also responsible for its medicinal properties. Wilsonaria arguta is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
