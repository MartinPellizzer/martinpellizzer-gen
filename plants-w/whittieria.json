    "intro": "Whittieria, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It comprises several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their woody stems, palmate leaves, and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Whittieria species are adapted to dry conditions, often featuring thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. They play an important ecological role in desert ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
