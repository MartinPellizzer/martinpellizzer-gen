    "intro": "Werauhia pedicellata, commonly known as the pink werauhia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Central and South America, particularly in regions of Mexico and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which is used by various animals and insects. Its flowers, which are typically pink or red, bloom in summer and are borne on long, branched inflorescences. Werauhia pedicellata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
