    "intro": "Willoughbya phyllopoda, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. It is a member of the Araceae family, which includes plants like philodendrons and peace lilies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Willoughbya phyllopoda is considered endangered and is protected in its native environment."
