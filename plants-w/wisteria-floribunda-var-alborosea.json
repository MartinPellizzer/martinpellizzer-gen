It is characterized by its long, cascading clusters of fragrant, white flowers with pale pink veins. The plant is a deciduous vine that produces heart-shaped leaves and is native to Japan. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in gardens for its ornamental value. Due to its rapid growth, it requires regular pruning to control its spread and maintain its shape."
