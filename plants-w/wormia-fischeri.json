    "intro": "Wormia fischeri, commonly known as the fairy moss, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its structure consists of a dense mat of tiny, leaf-like structures called gametophytes. Wormia fischeri plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
