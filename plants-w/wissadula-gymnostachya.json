    "intro": "Wissadula gymnostachya, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and unique, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Its habitat is highly specific, requiring high humidity and filtered light, which makes it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Wissadula gymnostachya is listed as endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
