    "intro": "Weinmannia bullata, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, with a leathery texture that aids in water retention. Weinmannia bullata is often found growing in rocky soils along coastal bluffs and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray."
