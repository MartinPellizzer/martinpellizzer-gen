    "intro": "Weinmannia arcabucoana, commonly known as the Arcabuco weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Weinmannia arcabucoana is also notable for its ornamental value, with showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
