    "intro": "Waldschmidia, commonly known as the \"forest shieldflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Kenya. The plants are characterized by their compact, rosette-like growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. Waldschmidia species typically thrive in well-drained soils and require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. They are popular in rock gardens and containers due to their ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
