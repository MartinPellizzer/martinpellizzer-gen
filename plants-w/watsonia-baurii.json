    "intro": "Watsonia baurii, commonly known as the Natal grass or the red Watsonia, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and showy, red-orange flower spikes that bloom in summer. The plant produces dense clusters of tubular flowers, which are often pollinated by birds and insects. Watsonia baurii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its vibrant colors and architectural form make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
