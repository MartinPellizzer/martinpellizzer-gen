    "intro": "Wedelia carnosa, commonly known as the silver bush or carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming throughout the warm season. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy, silver-gray appearance, giving it a distinctive, ornamental look. Wedelia carnosa is often used in landscaping for ground cover due to its ability to suppress weeds and its drought-tolerant nature."
