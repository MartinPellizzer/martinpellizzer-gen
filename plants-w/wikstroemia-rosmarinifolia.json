    "intro": "Wikstroemia rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf wikstroemia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
