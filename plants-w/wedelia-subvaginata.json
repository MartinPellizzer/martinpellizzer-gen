    "intro": "Wedelia subvaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and garden beds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
