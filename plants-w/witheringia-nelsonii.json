    "intro": "Witheringia nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's witheringia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Witheringia nelsonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
