    "intro": "Wisteria praecox, commonly known as early wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It produces long, pendant clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves emerge. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with 15 to 30 oval-shaped leaflets. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Wisteria praecox is valued for its ornamental beauty but can be invasive in some regions."
