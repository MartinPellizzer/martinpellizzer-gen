    "intro": "Wulfenia \u00d7 schwarzii, commonly known as the hybrid wolfberry, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Wulfenia micrantha and Wulfenia lindheimeri, both members of the Campanulaceae family. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers. Its leaves are often grayish-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Wulfenia \u00d7 schwarzii is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and ecological adaptations."
