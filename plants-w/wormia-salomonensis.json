    "intro": "Wormia salomonensis, commonly known as the Solomon Islands wormia, is a small, moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a dense arrangement of tiny, overlapping leaves that help retain moisture. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Wormia salomonensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
