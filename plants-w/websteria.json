    "intro": "Websteria, commonly known as the spider plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its long, arching stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically grass-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a bluish-green hue. Websteria species are popular in horticulture due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions. They are also known for their ability to produce offsets, making them easy to propagate."
