    "intro": "Wrightia rothii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Wrightiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. Wrightia rothii is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
