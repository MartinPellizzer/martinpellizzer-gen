It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange inflorescences. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Walteranthus species are herbaceous perennials with lance-shaped leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
