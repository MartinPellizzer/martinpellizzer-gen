    "intro": "Wettinia minima, commonly known as the dwarf wettinia, is a rare and small evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its compact size and dense foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of less than one meter, with slender, clustered stems and narrow, elongated leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wettinia minima is considered a conservation concern."
