    "intro": "Wittmackanthus stanleyanus, commonly known as Stanley's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals that resemble translucent leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, often in clusters along its slender, hanging stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree roots or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in its native range."
