    "intro": "Wikstroemia shuttleworthiana, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the soft floral displays. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and well-drained soils."
