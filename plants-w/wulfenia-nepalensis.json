It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. Wulfenia nepalensis is often found in meadows and on mountain slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
