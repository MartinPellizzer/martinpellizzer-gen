    "intro": "Windmannia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf windmannia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are arranged oppositely along the stems. Its small, tubular flowers are typically violet or purple in color, and they bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Windmannia sessilifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for container gardening."
