    "intro": "Wedelia bracteosa, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically forms dense mats, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in ornamental gardening. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a weed in non-native habitats."
