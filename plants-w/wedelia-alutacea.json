    "intro": "Wedelia alutacea, commonly known as the prostrate wedelia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for use in ornamental gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ability to spread via stolons make it an effective plant for stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas."
