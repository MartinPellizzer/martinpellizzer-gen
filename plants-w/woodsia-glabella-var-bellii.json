    "intro": "Woodsia glabella var. bellii, commonly known as the Appalachian woodsia, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are released during the late summer months. This variety is notable for its distinct leaf morphology and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
