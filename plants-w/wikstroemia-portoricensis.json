    "intro": "Wikstroemia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and stream banks. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
