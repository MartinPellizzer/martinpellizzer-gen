    "intro": "Woodsia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood sorrel, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base and a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Woodsia intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
