    "intro": "Weihea bequaertii, commonly known as the Hawaiian fan palm, is a species native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in coastal areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are arranged in a fan shape, and it produces small, yellow flowers that develop into dark purple fruits. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, Weihea bequaertii is considered critically endangered."
