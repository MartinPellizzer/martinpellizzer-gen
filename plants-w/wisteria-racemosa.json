    "intro": "Wisteria racemosa, commonly known as the native wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in cascading clusters. The plant produces pinnately compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are typically purple or violet, appearing in spring, and its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds. Wisteria racemosa is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it can climb trees or shrubs."
