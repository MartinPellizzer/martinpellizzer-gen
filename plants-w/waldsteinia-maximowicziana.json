    "intro": "Waldsteinia maximowicziana, commonly known as the white mountain cranesbill, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing habit, featuring a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are basal, arranged in a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Waldsteinia maximowicziana is well adapted to rocky and dry habitats, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
