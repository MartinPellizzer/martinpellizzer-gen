    "intro": "Weingaertneria canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a weeping appearance, and its leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
