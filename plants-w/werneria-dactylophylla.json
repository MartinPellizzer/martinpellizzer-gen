    "intro": "Werneria dactylophylla, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to survive in drought conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities."
