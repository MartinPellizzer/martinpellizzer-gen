    "intro": "Willoughbya hastata, commonly known as the broad-leafed willoughbya, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
