    "intro": "Westringia viminalis, commonly known as coastal wallaby-jack, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in spring and summer. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in coastal landscapes."
