    "intro": "Waltheria cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is known for its fibrous stems and hairy foliage. Waltheria cordata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
