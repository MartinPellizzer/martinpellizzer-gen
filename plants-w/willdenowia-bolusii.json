    "intro": "Willdenowia bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's willdenowia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually bright red or orange, with prominent yellow stamens, and it blooms during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
