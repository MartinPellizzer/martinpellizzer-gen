    "intro": "Werauhia orjuelae, commonly known as the Orjuela's werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the humid forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. Its leaves are stiff and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention in its natural habitat. Werauhia orjuelae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
