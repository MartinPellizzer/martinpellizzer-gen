It features a distinctive, arching frond with a bright green, leathery texture and a prominent, spore-bearing structure called a sorus. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its foliage remains vibrant throughout the winter, giving it its common name. Waddingtonia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
