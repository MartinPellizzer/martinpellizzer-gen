    "intro": "Weberbauerocereus rauhii var. laticornua, commonly known as the broad-horned cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that often branch out into multiple stems. The plant produces white, tubular flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its thick, ribbed stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. This variety is distinguished by its broader spines compared to other varieties within the same species."
