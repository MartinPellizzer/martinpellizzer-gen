It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a slight waxy coating. The flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters and producing a lightweight, wind-pollinated pollen. Weilbachia reptans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
