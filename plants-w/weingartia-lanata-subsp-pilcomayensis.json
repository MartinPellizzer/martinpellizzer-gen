    "intro": "Weingartia lanata subsp. pilcomayensis, commonly known as the Pilcomayo prickly pear, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to Argentina. It features a compact, globular stem covered in white, woolly spines that provide insulation and protection. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
