    "intro": "Wormia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan wormia, is a small, leaf-like plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Wormia madagascariensis is notable for its unique reproductive structures, which are adapted for spore dispersal in its native habitat."
