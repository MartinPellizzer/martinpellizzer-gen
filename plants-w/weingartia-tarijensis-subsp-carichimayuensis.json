    "intro": "Weingartia tarijensis subsp. carichimayuensis, commonly known as the Carichimayu weingartia, is a rare and compact cactus native to Bolivia. It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color, covered with white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
