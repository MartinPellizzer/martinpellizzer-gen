    "intro": "Wormskioldia mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique wormskioldia, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive structure with a thallus that is usually green or yellowish in color, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. This moss-like plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in southern Africa."
