    "intro": "Weinmannia apetala, commonly known as the leafless weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring reduced leaves and a dense, branched structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. Weinmannia apetala plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
