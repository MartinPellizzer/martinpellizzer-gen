    "intro": "Wiborgia armella, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Wiborgia armella is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
