    "intro": "Weigela pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered weigela, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for smaller gardens or containers. Weigela pauciflora is valued for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
