It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and nocturnal flowering habit, producing large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant has a spiny exterior and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species for dry climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bats and moths, which are attracted to its strong scent and nectar. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming pattern."
