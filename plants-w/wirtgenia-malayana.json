    "intro": "Wirtgenia malayana, commonly known as the Malayan wirtgenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the fruits are small, spherical, and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wirtgenia malayana is considered a species of conservation concern."
