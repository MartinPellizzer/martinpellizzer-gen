    "intro": "Wolffia delilei, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in size. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, floating structure called a thallus. Wolffia delilei reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new individuals forming from the fragmentation of the parent plant. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
