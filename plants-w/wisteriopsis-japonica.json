    "intro": "Wisteriopsis japonica, commonly known as Japanese wisteria, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces compound leaves with palmately arranged leaflets, and its flowers are often used in ornamental gardening. Wisteriopsis japonica is closely related to the genus Wisteria and shares similar growth habits. However, it is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relative, Wisteria sinensis."
