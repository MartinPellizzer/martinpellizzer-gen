    "intro": "Waltheria arenaria, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
