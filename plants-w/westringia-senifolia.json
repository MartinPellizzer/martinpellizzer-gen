The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
