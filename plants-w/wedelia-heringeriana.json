    "intro": "Wedelia heringeriana, commonly known as the creeping wedelia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or white, blooming throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for use in ground cover or as a decorative plant in gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread easily make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain environments."
