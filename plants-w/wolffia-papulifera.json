    "intro": "Wolffia papulifera, commonly known as the water moss or duckweed, is a minute aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in size. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems and a potential candidate for biofuel production. Wolffia papulifera reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants developing from the fragmentation of existing fronds."
