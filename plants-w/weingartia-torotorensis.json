    "intro": "Weingartia torotorensis, commonly known as the Torotore cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of southern Africa. It is a small, compact cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of white, woolly spines that cover the plant, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
