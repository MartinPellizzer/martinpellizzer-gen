    "intro": "Wulffia hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf wulffia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a broad, ovate shape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Wulffia hastata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
