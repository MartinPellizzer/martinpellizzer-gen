    "intro": "Waltheria macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf waltheria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
