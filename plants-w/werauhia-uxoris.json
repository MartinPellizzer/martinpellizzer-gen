    "intro": "Werauhia uxoris, commonly known as the pink werauhia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Werauhia uxoris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
