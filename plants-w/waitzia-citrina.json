    "intro": "Waitzia citrina, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a type of foliose lichen that thrives in humid, temperate environments. It consists of a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and substrate. The plant's flattened, leaf-like structure is composed of a complex network of hyphae that form a protective layer over the algal cells. It typically grows on tree trunks, rocks, and soil surfaces, contributing to nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Its bright yellow color comes from the presence of specific pigments in the algal component."
