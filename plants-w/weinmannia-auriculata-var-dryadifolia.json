It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptical in shape, and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. This plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
