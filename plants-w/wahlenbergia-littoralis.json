    "intro": "Wahlenbergia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Wahlenbergia littoralis is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
