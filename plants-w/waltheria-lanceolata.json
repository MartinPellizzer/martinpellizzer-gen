    "intro": "Waltheria lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, and it thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces showy purple to pink flowers in late summer. Waltheria lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
