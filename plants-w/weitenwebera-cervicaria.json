    "intro": "Weitenwebera cervicaria, commonly known as the \"Cervicaria\" or \"Neck Orchid,\" is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a striking, helmet-like lip that resembles a human head, giving it its distinctive common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, and it blooms during the warmer months. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
