    "intro": "Welwitschia densifolia, commonly known as the desert fanflower, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from underground sources. Welwitschia densifolia is well adapted to extreme drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
