    "intro": "Wagatea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their distinctive, feathery, silver-green foliage that gives them their common name. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often found in moist, shaded environments. Wagatea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage."
