    "intro": "Weinmannia auriculifera, commonly known as the ear-shaped weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its distinctive, auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall. Weinmannia auriculifera is an important plant in its native ecosystem, providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
