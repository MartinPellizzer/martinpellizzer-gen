    "intro": "Wahlenbergia caryophylloides, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces vibrant pink or purple blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Wahlenbergia caryophylloides is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
