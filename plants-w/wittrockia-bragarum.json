    "intro": "Wittrockia bragarum, commonly known as the Cape rose, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. Wittrockia bragarum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
