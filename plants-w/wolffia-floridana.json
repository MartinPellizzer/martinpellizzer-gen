    "intro": "Wolffia floridana, commonly known as water moss, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individuals typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flat structure that floats on the water surface. Wolffia floridana reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of the parent plant. It plays an important role in freshwater ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for aquatic organisms."
