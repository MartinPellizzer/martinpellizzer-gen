    "intro": "Wissadula callimorpha var. friesii, commonly known as the Fries' starfish lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive star-shaped thallus with a pale to yellowish-green color. It typically grows on bark and wood in humid, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The lichen has a delicate, leaf-like structure with lobes that are often arranged in a star pattern, giving it its common name. It is characterized by its slow growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. This species is of interest to lichenologists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
