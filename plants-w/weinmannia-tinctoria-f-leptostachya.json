It is characterized by its slender, elongated stamens that distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale yellow or greenish hue. This form is of interest in botanical gardens and research due to its unique floral morphology and potential ecological significance."
