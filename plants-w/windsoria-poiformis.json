    "intro": "Windsoria poiformis, commonly known as the clustered windflower, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive, clustered inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. The plant is known for its aromatic properties, with a subtle, spicy scent that becomes more pronounced when the leaves are crushed."
