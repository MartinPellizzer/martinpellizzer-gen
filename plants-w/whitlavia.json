    "intro": "Whitlavia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silvery-gray foliage that helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. Its small, daisy-like flowers bloom in shades of white and yellow, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Whitlavia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
