    "intro": "Woodwardia orientalis var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan shield fern, is a variant of the oriental shield fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically biennial, with fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
