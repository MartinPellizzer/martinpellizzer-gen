    "intro": "Walsura pachycaulon, commonly known as the thick-stemmed tamarind, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and dense foliage, which contribute to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate and compound, with a glossy surface that aids in photosynthesis. Walsura pachycaulon is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, well-drained soils."
