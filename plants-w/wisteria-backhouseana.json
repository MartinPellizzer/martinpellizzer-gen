    "intro": "Wisteria backhouseana, commonly known as the New Zealand wisteria, is a climbing vine native to New Zealand. It features long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has compound leaves with three to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in soft, hairy tissue. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. Despite its ornamental appeal, it can be invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
