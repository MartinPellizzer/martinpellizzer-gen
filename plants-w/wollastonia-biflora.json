    "intro": "Wollastonia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered wattle, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Wollastonia biflora is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
