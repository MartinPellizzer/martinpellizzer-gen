    "intro": "Wajira, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a robust shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling dates. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly resilient in harsh environments. Wajira is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance in many local communities."
