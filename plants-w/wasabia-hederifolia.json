    "intro": "Wasabia hederifolia, commonly known as Japanese wasabi, is a perennial plant native to the cool, moist climates of Japan, Korea, and China. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its bright green, slightly hairy leaves and small white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, well-drained soils and requires a cool climate to grow successfully. Its rhizomes, which are the primary edible part, are prized for their pungent aroma and medicinal properties. Wasabia hederifolia is often cultivated in hydroponic systems to mimic its natural mountain stream environment."
