It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to bronze, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring and early summer. It thrives in partial to full sunlight and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements make it a favored plant among botanists and gardeners alike."
