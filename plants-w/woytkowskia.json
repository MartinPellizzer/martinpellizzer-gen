    "intro": "Woytkowskia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on the bark of trees, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, spicy scent. Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered a critically endangered species."
