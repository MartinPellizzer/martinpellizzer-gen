    "intro": "Wallrothia tuberosa, commonly known as the mountain onion, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a bulbous stem covered in dense, fibrous roots, which help it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight bluish tint. Wallrothia tuberosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
