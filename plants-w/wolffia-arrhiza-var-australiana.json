    "intro": "Wolffia arrhiza var. australiana, commonly known as the minute duckweed, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its extremely small, floating leaves that are less than 1 millimeter in size, often appearing as greenish-yellow discs. The plant lacks true roots and instead has root-like structures called rhizoids that anchor it to submerged surfaces. Wolffia arrhiza var. australiana is capable of rapid vegetative reproduction through the production of tiny, free-floating offspring called tubers. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
