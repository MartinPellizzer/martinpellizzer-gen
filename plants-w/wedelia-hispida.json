It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its dense, spreading growth. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually hairy and oval-shaped, contributing to its common name. Wedelia hispida is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
