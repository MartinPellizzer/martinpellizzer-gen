    "intro": "Wedelia ovatifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and is often used as a ground cover or in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are ovate to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Wedelia ovatifolia is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its low maintenance requirements."
