    "intro": "Webera sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran Webera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
