    "intro": "Weinmannia pinnata var. farallonensis, commonly known as the Farallon Island Weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Farallon Islands off the coast of California. It is characterized by its compound, pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is adapted to the harsh, coastal environment. This variety is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
