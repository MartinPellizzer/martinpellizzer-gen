    "intro": "Wedeliella incarnata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy redwood or hairy podo, is a rare and unique plant species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family, which includes evergreen conifers, and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, red berries. The plant is notable for its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its varietal name \"villosa.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
