    "intro": "Witheringia purpurea, commonly known as purple nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically green with a purple tinge. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its berries are dark blue to black when mature and contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Witheringia purpurea is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
