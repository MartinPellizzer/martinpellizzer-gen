It features slender, prostrate stems that bear small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
