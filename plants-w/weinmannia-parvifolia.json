    "intro": "Weinmannia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique floral structure and adaptability to coastal conditions make it a notable species in its native habitat. Weinmannia parvifolia is often found in sandy soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
