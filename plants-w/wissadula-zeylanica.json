    "intro": "Wissadula zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon snowball, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its ornamental value is due to its showy inflorescences, which resemble small snowballs, making it a popular garden plant. Wissadula zeylanica prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, thriving in cooler climates."
