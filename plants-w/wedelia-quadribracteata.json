    "intro": "Wedelia quadribracteata, commonly known as the four-bract wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb characterized by its prostrate growth habit and dense, mat-forming foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often accompanied by four bract-like structures. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weeds and its attractive appearance."
