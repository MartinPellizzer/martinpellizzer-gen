    "intro": "Whiteodendron, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the genus Fraxinus and is characterized by its compound leaves with opposite arrangement. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Whiteodendron is valued for its strong, durable wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
