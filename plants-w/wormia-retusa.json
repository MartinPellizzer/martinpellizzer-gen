    "intro": "Wormia retusa, commonly known as the slender worm moss, is a small, creeping liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinct, thread-like appearance with elongated, ribbon-shaped leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It is typically found growing on soil, rocks, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Wormia retusa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
