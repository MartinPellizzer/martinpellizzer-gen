    "intro": "Wissadula amplissima var. typica, commonly known as the giant forest fern, is a striking member of the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant features a robust, creeping rhizome that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive silvery underside that reflects light. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
