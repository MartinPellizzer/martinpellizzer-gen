    "intro": "Wydleria portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil, and it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected by conservation efforts in its native range."
