    "intro": "Wrightia dubia var. membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous wrightia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and elliptical leaves that are often membranous in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species in horticulture, though it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
