    "intro": "Woodwardia fimbriata, commonly known as the lady's tresses, is a herbaceous plant native to Asia and parts of Europe. It belongs to the Ophioglossaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often fimbriated (fringed) leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures are unique, with spore-bearing cones that develop at the base of the plant. Woodwardia fimbriata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
