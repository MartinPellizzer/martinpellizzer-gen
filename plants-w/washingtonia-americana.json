    "intro": "Washingtonia americana, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a tall, single-stemmed palm native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, feather-like leaves arranged in a fan shape at the top. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark blue berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is well adapted to arid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. The Mexican fan palm is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and resilience."
