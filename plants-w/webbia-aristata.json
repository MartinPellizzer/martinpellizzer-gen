    "intro": "Webbia aristata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
