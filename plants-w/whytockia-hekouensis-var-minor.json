It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to its parent species. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits that distinguish it from other members of the genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and taxonomic studies."
