    "intro": "Wolfia, commonly known as water moss, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Chlorophyceae. It consists of small, free-floating algae that are typically found in freshwater environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of simple, unicellular structures that form dense mats on the water surface. Wolfia species are characterized by their rapid growth and ability to reproduce through vegetative propagation. These plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
