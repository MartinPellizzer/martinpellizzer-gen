    "intro": "Wendlandia subalpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Wendlandia subalpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
