    "intro": "Weinmannia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from narrow and linear to broad and ovate depending on their position on the plant. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its unique leaf variation and ecological resilience make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
