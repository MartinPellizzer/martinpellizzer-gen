    "intro": "Waltheria prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate waltheria, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial that typically spreads along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Waltheria prostrata is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
