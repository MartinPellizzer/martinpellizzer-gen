    "intro": "Woodsiopsis scopulina, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or shaded habitats, such as cliffs, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has a compact, creeping growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective shield. Woodsiopsis scopulina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
