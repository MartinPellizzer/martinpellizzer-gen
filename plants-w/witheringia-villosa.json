    "intro": "Witheringia villosa, commonly known as the silky willow or woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and riparian areas. Witheringia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
