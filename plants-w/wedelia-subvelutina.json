    "intro": "Wedelia subvelutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf wedelia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. Wedelia subvelutina is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
