    "intro": "Wedelia saltensis, commonly known as saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to coastal dunes and saline soils. Wedelia saltensis is also valued for its use in stabilizing sand dunes and as a low-maintenance ornamental plant."
