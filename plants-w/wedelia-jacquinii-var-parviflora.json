    "intro": "Wedelia jacquinii var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, clustered yellow flowers throughout the growing season. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for ground cover. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, often found in moist, open habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant yellow blooms and its ability to spread rapidly in suitable conditions."
