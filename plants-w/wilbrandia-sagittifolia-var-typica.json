    "intro": "Wilbrandia sagittifolia var. typica, commonly known as the arrowleaf balsam, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often green with a waxy texture, and it produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
