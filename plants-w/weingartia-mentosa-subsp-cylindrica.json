    "intro": "Weingartia mentosa subsp. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical weingartia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features a spherical or slightly cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green areoles with short, white bristles. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, typically at the base of the stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
