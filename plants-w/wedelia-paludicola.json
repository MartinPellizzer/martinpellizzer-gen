    "intro": "Wedelia paludicola, commonly known as the marsh wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, swampy environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Wedelia paludicola is notable for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas, making it ecologically significant in its habitat."
