    "intro": "Weberocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the southern United States, Mexico, and Central America. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal flowering habits, with large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators such as bats and moths. The genus includes several species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value and unique growth forms. Weberocereus plants are adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
