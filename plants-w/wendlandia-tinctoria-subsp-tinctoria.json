    "intro": "Wendlandia tinctoria subsp. tinctoria, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking plant native to South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like clusters of bright red bracts that resemble flames. The plant produces small yellow flowers at the base of the bracts, which are often overlooked due to the showy display of the bracts. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from summer into autumn."
