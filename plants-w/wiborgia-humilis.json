    "intro": "Wiborgia humilis, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming from June to August. Wiborgia humilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
