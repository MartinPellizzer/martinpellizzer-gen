    "intro": "Wedelia glauca, commonly known as blue carpet or blue wedelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread rapidly and form a lush, uniform carpet."
