    "intro": "Withania hirsuta, commonly known as the Indian winter cherry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Withania hirsuta is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine."
