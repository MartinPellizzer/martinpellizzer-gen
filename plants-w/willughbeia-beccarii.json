    "intro": "Willughbeia beccarii, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dark, almost black bark and dense, rounded canopy. It plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various species. Willughbeia beccarii is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and tool-making."
