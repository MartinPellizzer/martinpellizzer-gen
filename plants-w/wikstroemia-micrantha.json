    "intro": "Wikstroemia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and near the sea. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Wikstroemia micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
