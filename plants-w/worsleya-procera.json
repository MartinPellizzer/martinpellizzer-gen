    "intro": "Worsleya procera, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, and it thrives in high humidity and warm temperatures. Worsleya procera is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific environmental requirements."
