    "intro": "Wrightia tinctoria subsp. tinctoria, commonly known as the Indian bead tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, bead-like fruits containing several seeds. The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their potential health benefits. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it an important species in both horticulture and traditional practices."
