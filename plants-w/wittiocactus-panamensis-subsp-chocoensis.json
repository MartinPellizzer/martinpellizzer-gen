    "intro": "Wittiocactus panamensis subsp. chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan wittiocactus, is a rare cactus native to the humid, tropical regions of western Colombia. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a hardy species adapted to its environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
