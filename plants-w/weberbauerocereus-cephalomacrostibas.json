It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of white and yellow. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The cactus is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a striking addition to arid landscapes."
