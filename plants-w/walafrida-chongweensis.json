    "intro": "Walafrida chongweensis, commonly known as the Chongwe lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the eastern African region of Malawi. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
