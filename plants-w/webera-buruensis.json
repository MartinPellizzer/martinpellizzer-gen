    "intro": "Webera buruensis, commonly known as the Buru sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its use in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Webera buruensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
