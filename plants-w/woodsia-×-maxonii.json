    "intro": "Woodsia \u00d7 maxonii, commonly known as the hybrid wood fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Woodsia orientalis and Woodsia scolopendria. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a dark green color and a velvety texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
