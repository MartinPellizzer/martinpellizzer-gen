    "intro": "Wulfenia alpina, commonly known as the alpine wulfenia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Wulfenia alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
