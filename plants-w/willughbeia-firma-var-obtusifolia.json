It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically broad and ovate with a blunt tip. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
