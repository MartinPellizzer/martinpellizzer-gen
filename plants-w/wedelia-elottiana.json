It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm seasons. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions."
