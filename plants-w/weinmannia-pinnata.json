It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating that reflects light, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
