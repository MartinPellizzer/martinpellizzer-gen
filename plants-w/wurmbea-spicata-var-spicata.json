    "intro": "Wurmbea spicata var. spicata, commonly known as the African lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with tubers that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
