    "intro": "Wikstroemia ovata, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Wikstroemia ovata is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species competition."
