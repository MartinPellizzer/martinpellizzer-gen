It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Wiggersia sylvatica is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
