    "intro": "Warea carteri, commonly known as the Carter's warea, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in forested areas, often in the understorey where it thrives in shade and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Warea carteri is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators."
