    "intro": "Warneckea guineensis, commonly known as African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly wavy margin. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy timber used in furniture and construction, though its conservation status is of concern due to overharvesting."
