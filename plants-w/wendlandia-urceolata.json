    "intro": "Wendlandia urceolata, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a waterwheel, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer."
