It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem that typically grows to a height of about 20 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and spineless, turning into spines as the plant matures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
