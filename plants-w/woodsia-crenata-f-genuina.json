    "intro": "Woodsia crenata f. genuina, commonly known as the smooth woodsia, is a fern species native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a glossy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, contributing to its ability to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
