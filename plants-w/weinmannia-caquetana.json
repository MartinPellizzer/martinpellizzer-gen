It is native to the Andean regions of Colombia and is characterized by its woody structure and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female parts present on the same inflorescence. Weinmannia caquetana plays a role in local ecosystems and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
