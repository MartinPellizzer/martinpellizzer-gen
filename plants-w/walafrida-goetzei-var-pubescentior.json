    "intro": "Walafrida goetzei var. pubescentior, commonly known as the pubescent walafrida, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely pubescent (hairy) leaves and small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a slender, herbaceous stem and a distinctive, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
