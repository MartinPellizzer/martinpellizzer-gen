    "intro": "Wendlandia merrilliana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved wendlandia, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its showy blooms and compact growth habit."
