    "intro": "Weinmannia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate rainfall. Weinmannia ovalifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
