    "intro": "Webera celebica, commonly known as the Celebes sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and Buton. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark brown wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
