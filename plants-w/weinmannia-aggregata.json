    "intro": "Weinmannia aggregata, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its bark is often fissured and grayish, providing a distinctive appearance. Weinmannia aggregata is well adapted to coastal climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
