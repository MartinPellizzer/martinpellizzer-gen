    "intro": "Willoughbya banisteriae, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing during the Christmas season. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with thick, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich nature. Willoughbya banisteriae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
