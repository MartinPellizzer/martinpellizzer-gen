    "intro": "Woodsiopsis oregana subsp. cathcartiana, commonly known as the Cathcart's woodsiopsis, is a fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside habitats. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This subspecies is notable for its distinct morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
