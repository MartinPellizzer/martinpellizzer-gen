    "intro": "Wedelia sieberi, commonly known as the dwarf iron vine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its dense, mat-forming structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptability and role in ecological restoration projects."
