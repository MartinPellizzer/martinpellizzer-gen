    "intro": "Weinmannia ilutepuiensis, commonly known as the Ilutepui Weinmannia, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Ecuador. It is a small shrub or tree with dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy white or pink flowers, which attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds upon maturity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
