    "intro": "Weinmannia microphylla var. typica, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy soils and salty air."
