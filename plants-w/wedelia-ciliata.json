    "intro": "Wedelia ciliata, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
