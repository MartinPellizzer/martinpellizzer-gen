    "intro": "Werneria caespitosa var. haenkei, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
