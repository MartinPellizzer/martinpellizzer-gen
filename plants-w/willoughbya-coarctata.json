    "intro": "Willoughbya coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow. It is a flowering plant native to northern Australia, characterized by its slender, willow-like appearance. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes. It thrives in wetland or swampy environments, often growing along the edges of water bodies. Willoughbya coarctata is adapted to tolerate seasonal flooding and has a shallow root system that helps it anchor in soft, muddy soils."
