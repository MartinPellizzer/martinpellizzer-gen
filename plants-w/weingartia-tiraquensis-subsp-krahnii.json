    "intro": "Weingartia tiraquensis subsp. krahnii, commonly known as the Krahnii Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Argentina. It features a dense arrangement of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
