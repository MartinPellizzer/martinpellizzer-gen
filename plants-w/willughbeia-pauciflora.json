    "intro": "Willughbeia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered willughbeia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the understory of dense forests. Willughbeia pauciflora plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
