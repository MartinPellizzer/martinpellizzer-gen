    "intro": "Walafrida rigida, commonly known as the rigid walafrid, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
