    "intro": "Werauhia nocturna, commonly known as the nightshade werauhia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that bloom at night. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the rainforest canopy. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a cup that collects water and nutrients. Werauhia nocturna is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
