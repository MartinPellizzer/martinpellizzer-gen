    "intro": "Woodwardia radicans var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, linear shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
