    "intro": "Wedeliella incarnata var. anodonta, commonly known as the pink-flowered marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
