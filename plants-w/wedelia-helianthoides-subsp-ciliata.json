    "intro": "Wedelia helianthoides subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a low-growing perennial herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. Its fibrous roots make it a useful plant for erosion control in moist, sandy soils. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
