    "intro": "Westringia rigida var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved westringia, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale blue to violet flowers during late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
