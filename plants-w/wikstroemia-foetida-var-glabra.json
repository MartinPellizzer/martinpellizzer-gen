    "intro": "Wikstroemia foetida var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sandverbena, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, often silver-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
