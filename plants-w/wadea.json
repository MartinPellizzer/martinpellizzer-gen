It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its showy, often colorful flowers. Wadea species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to regions in Africa and the Middle East. They thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making them well-adapted to dry climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
