    "intro": "Weinmannia davidsonii, commonly known as the Davidson's weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild temperatures and salt spray. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
