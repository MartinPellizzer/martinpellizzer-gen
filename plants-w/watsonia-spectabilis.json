    "intro": "Watsonia spectabilis, commonly known as the purple firecracker lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features broad, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces large, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Watsonia spectabilis is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its vibrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to its ecological significance."
