    "intro": "Wedelia calycina var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its prostrate stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its rapid growth and ability to suppress weeds."
