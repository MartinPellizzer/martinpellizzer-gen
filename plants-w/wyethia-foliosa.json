    "intro": "Wyethia foliosa, commonly known as the leafy wyethia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Wyethia foliosa is a short-lived perennial that thrives in regions with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers."
