    "intro": "Weihea guineensis, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Weihea guineensis is considered endangered in many parts of its native range."
