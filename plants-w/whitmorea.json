    "intro": "Whitmorea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their velvety, waxy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are typically grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid environments. Whitmorea species are popular for their ornamental value and ease of care. The plants thrive in indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
