    "intro": "Warneckea mouririfolia, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it is often cultivated in gardens and for reforestation purposes."
