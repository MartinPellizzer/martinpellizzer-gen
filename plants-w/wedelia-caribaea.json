It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Wedelia caribaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover."
