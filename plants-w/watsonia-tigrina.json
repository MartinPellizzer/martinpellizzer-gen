    "intro": "Watsonia tigrina, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a distinctive black or dark purple pattern. The plant produces large, fleshy leaves that are typically green with prominent veins. Watsonia tigrina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically occurs in late winter to early spring."
