    "intro": "Weinmannia epicae, commonly known as the giant weinmannia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by ornamental, cone-like fruits. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, often growing in cloud forests. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
