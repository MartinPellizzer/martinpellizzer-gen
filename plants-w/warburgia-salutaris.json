It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional African medicine."
