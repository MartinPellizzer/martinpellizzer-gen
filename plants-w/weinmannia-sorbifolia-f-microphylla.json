    "intro": "Weinmannia sorbifolia f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf weinmannia, is a compact shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving the plant a silvery appearance. The leaves are arranged in a rosette-like pattern, which helps the plant conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
