It is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields.
