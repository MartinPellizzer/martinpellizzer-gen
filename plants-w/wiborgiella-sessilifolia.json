It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many ornamental and tropical plants. The plant is characterized by its small, sessile leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
