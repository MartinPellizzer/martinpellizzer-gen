    "intro": "Werauhia insignis, commonly known as the royal werauhia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss in humid environments. Werauhia insignis is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches, making it an epiphytic plant adapted to life in the canopy of the rainforest."
