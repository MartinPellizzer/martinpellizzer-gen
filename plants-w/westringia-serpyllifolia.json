    "intro": "Westringia serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common westringia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with aromatic, grey-green foliage that is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. Westringia serpyllifolia is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry environments."
