    "intro": "Willoughbya scandens var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered willoughbya, is a striking evergreen shrub native to tropical Australia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its showy, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces fleshy, orange-red berries that are a key feature in its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its vibrant floral display and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
