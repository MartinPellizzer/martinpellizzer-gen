It features a tall, unbranched trunk that is covered with a fibrous, spongy outer layer. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach several feet in length. It produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible dates. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
