    "intro": "Weinmannia crenata, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery, fuzzy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are often lobed and have a distinctive waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Weinmannia crenata is a member of the aster family (Asteraceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
