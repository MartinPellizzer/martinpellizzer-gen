    "intro": "Woodsia rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments, often growing on cliffs or in crevices. Its rhizomes are typically short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself firmly in nutrient-poor soils. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
