    "intro": "Wistaria, commonly known as Chinese trumpet vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to East Asia. It produces long, cascading clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant has opposite, simple leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate. Wistaria thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it can grow quite large if not pruned regularly. Its rapid growth makes it both a beautiful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
