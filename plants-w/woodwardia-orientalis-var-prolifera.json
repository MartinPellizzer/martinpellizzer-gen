    "intro": "Woodwardia orientalis var. prolifera, commonly known as the oriental sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, with a distinctive, linear shape. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a key feature of fern reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
