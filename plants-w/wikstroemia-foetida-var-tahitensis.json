    "intro": "Wikstroemia foetida var. tahitensis, commonly known as Tahitian sandarac, is a shrub native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces a fragrant, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional Polynesian crafts and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in coastal and limestone soils, often growing in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
