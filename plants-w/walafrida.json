    "intro": "Walafrida, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a faint, sweet fragrance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense, carpet-like clusters. Walafrida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal remedies."
