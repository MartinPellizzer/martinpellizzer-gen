    "intro": "Wedelia pilosa, commonly known as the creeping wedelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Wedelia pilosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in garden beds."
