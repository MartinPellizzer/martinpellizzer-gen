It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
