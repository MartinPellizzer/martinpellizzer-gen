    "intro": "Woodwardia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in cooler climates."
