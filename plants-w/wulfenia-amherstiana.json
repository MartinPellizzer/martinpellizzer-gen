    "intro": "Wulfenia amherstiana, commonly known as Amherst's wulfenia, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Wulfenia amherstiana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, elevated environments."
