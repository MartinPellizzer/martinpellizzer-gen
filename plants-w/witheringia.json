    "intro": "Witheringia, commonly known as the death cap mushroom, is a poisonous fungus belonging to the Amanita genus. It is characterized by a white cap that turns yellow with age, a distinct ring around the stem, and a volva at the base. The plant contains amatoxins, which are highly toxic compounds that can cause severe liver damage in humans and animals. It is often found in woodlands and is closely related to other toxic Amanita species. Due to its deadly properties, it is crucial to avoid consuming any part of this fungus."
