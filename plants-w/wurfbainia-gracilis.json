    "intro": "Wurfbainia gracilis, commonly known as the slender sandverbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the cooler months, typically from late summer to early winter. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Wurfbainia gracilis is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in rocky outcrops or along riverbanks."
