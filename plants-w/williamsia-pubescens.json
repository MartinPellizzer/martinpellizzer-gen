It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes."
