It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are narrow and grass-like, which give it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, colorful flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Werauhia graminifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
