    "intro": "Woodwardia areolata, commonly known as the Southern Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The fronds have a distinctive, segmented structure with a prominent central vein and a series of small, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
