    "intro": "Wigandia caracasana f. viscosa, commonly known as the viscous wigandia, is a variant of the native South American plant Wigandia caracasana. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy, viscid stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal racemes, and its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. The viscous foliage and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural interest."
