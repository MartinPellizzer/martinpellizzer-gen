    "intro": "Weinmannia crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Weinmanniaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of Central America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are pollinated by insects. Weinmannia crassifolia is adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
