    "intro": "Woodsiopsis obtusa subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western woodsiopsis, is a perennial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense mats. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive leaf shape and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
