    "intro": "Woodsia angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan woodsia, is a fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative means. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
