    "intro": "Wikstroemia linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. It is often found in shrublands and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
