    "intro": "Wurmbea inflata, commonly known as the inflated yellow flag, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a fleshy, swollen bulb that serves as its primary storage organ. The plant produces a single, erect stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its most distinctive feature is the showy, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Wurmbea inflata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
