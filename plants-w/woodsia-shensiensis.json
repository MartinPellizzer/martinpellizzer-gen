    "intro": "Woodsia shensiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan woodsia, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, serrated margin. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
