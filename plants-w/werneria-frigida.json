It thrives in cool, moist environments and is characterized by its slender stems and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It blooms during the late spring to early summer season, adding a unique touch to its alpine habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Werneria frigida is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change."
