    "intro": "Wedelia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate wedelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features sprawling stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Wedelia procumbens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
