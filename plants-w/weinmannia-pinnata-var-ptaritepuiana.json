    "intro": "Weinmannia pinnata var. ptaritepuiana, commonly known as the Tuarifua tree, is a tropical tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Tonga and Samoa. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
