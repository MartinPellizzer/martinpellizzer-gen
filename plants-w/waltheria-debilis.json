    "intro": "Waltheria debilis, commonly known as the slender marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that grow from a rhizomatous base, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to its moist, often swampy environment. Waltheria debilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems."
