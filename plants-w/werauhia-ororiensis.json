    "intro": "Werauhia ororiensis, commonly known as the Ororiense Werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the humid tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Werauhia ororiensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
