    "intro": "Wilbrandia sagittifolia var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, creating a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense colonies that provide habitat for aquatic life. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface. The varietal form 'dissecta' is distinguished by its more deeply cut leaf blades compared to the typical species."
