    "intro": "Wedelia triternata, commonly known as the creeping oxalis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
