    "intro": "Waitzia capensis, commonly known as the Cape waitzia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in spring. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal areas. The Cape waitzia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
