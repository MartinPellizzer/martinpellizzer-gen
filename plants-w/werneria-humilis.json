    "intro": "Werneria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Werneria humilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
