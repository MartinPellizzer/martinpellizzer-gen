    "intro": "Webbia pinifolia, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous leaves are often used in traditional crafts, and the plant is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Webbia pinifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
