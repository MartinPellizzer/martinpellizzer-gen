    "intro": "Woodwardia floridana, commonly known as the Florida shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a creeping rhizome with tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bi-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape, and are covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
