    "intro": "Wurmbea dioica subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and produces striking, star-shaped white flowers with a greenish hue. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. It has a short flowering period, usually in late winter to early spring, and relies on insect pollination. The subspecies brevifolia is distinguished by its shorter leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other subspecies of Wurmbea dioica."
