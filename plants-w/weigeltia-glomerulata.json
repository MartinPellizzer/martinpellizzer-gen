    "intro": "Weigeltia glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
