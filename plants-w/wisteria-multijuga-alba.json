    "intro": "Wisteria multijuga alba, commonly known as the Japanese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its long, cascading clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with ovate leaflets and can grow quite vigorously, reaching lengths of up to 30 feet. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
