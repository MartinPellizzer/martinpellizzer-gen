    "intro": "Wisteria grandiflora, commonly known as the Japanese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that can climb and entwine other structures. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pendant flowers that range in color from pale lavender to deep violet. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to seven oval-shaped leaflets. Wisteria grandiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty but can be invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
