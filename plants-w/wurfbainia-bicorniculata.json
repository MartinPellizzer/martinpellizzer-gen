    "intro": "Wurfbainia bicorniculata, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that bear two prominent, horn-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically violet or purple in color and bloom during the cooler months. Wurfbainia bicorniculata is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and requires specific conditions to thrive."
