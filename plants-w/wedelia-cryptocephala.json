It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with four petals, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
