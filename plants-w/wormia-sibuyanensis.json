    "intro": "Wormia sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan worm plant, is a rare and unique species native to the Philippines. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring tiny, thread-like leaves that resemble worms. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Its reproductive structures are simple, with small flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
