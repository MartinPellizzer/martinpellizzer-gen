    "intro": "Weinmannia microphylla var. tamana, commonly known as the Tamana weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mesic to wet forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
