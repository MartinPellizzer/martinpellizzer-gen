    "intro": "Weinmannia marquesana var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
