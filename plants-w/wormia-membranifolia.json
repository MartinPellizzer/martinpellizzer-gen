    "intro": "Wormia membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous wormia, is a small, creeping plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. Wormia membranifolia is often found in rocky or woodland soils, where it forms dense mats. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
