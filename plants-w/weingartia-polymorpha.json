    "intro": "Weingartia polymorpha, commonly known as the Mexican torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Weingartia polymorpha is well-suited for arid environments and is a popular choice for succulent gardens."
