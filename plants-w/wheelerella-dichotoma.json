    "intro": "Wheelerella dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous wheelerella, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Cephalopodaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, where stems split into two equal parts, creating a dichotomous growth form. The plant is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specialized requirements, Wheelerella dichotoma is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
