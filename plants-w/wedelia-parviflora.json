    "intro": "Wedelia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered wedelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs. It is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
