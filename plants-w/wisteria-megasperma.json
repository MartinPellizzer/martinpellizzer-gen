    "intro": "Wisteria megasperma, commonly known as Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous racemes of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with 12 to 18 oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are woody and capable of climbing by means of aerial roots. It produces seed pods that split open to release small, brown seeds. Wisteria megasperma is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
