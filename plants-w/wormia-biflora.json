    "intro": "Wormia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered worm plant, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features tiny, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in pairs, giving it the species name \"biflora,\" and they are usually pale green or white in color. Wormia biflora is known for its delicate appearance and is often overlooked due to its modest size."
