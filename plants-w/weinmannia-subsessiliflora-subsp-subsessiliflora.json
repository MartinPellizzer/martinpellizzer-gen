    "intro": "Weinmannia subsessiliflora subsp. subsessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with showy, red bracts that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its growth form is typically low and sprawling, with multiple stems emerging from the base. This subspecies is adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and well-drained, sandy soils."
