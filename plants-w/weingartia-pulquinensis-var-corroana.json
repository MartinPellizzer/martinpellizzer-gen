    "intro": "Weingartia pulquinensis var. corroana, commonly known as the Corroana Pincushion Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Argentina. It features a dense cluster of cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in fine, white spines that provide protection from herbivores. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements in arid environments."
