It is a low-growing perennial herb with creeping stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
