    "intro": "Wilkiea kaarruana, commonly known as the Christmas tree or Christmas bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It features dense, glossy green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Wilkiea kaarruana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
