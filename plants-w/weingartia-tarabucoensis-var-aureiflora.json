    "intro": "Weingartia tarabucoensis var. aureiflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Andes of Peru. It features dense, spiny areoles covered with white, silky hair, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for small spaces and rock gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to flourish."
