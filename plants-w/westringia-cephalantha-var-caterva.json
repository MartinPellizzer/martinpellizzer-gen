    "intro": "Westringia cephalantha var. caterva, commonly known as the narrow-leaf westringia, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, dark green, aromatic leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean-style gardens."
