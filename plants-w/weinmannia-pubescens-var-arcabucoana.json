It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins and a leathery texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats."
