It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft texture. Wedelia pratensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
