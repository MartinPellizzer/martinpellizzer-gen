    "intro": "Wolffia elongata, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individuals typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia elongata lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, flat structure that floats on the water's surface. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing ones. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a food source for various aquatic organisms."
