    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallenia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or shaded environments. Due to its unique foliage and modest floral display, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
