    "intro": "Woodsia subcordata var. kitadakensis, commonly known as the Japanese woodsia, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, leathery fronds that are often arching or upright, depending on the growth conditions. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens."
