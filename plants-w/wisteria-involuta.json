    "intro": "Wisteria involuta, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It produces long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets and can grow up to 30 meters in length. Its root system is extensive and can cause structural damage if not properly managed. Wisteria involuta is valued for its ornamental beauty but requires careful cultivation due to its vigorous growth."
