    "intro": "Watsonia meriana var. bulbillifera, commonly known as the Bulbiliferous Watsonia, is a striking perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear large, showy inflorescences composed of clustered, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces bulbils along its flower stems, which are small, vegetative structures that can develop into new plants, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivated settings."
