    "intro": "Willoughbya cordifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, leathery, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Willoughbya cordifolia is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
