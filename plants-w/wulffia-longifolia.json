It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long pedicels. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Wulffia longifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats."
