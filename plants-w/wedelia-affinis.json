    "intro": "Wedelia affinis, commonly known as the carpetweed or golden carpet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, adding a bright touch to its appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Wedelia affinis is valued in horticulture for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
