    "intro": "Wolffia denticulata, commonly known as water moss, is a member of the duckweed family and is one of the smallest flowering plants in the world. It is a free-floating aquatic plant that forms dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter in length, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Wolffia denticulata reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the division of existing fronds. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for various aquatic animals."
