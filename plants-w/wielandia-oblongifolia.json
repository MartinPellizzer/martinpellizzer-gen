    "intro": "Wielandia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces dark, spherical berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Wielandia oblongifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
