    "intro": "Witheringia diffusa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Witheringia diffusa is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
