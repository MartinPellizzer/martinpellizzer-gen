    "intro": "Wisteria floribunda var. longissima, commonly known as the Japanese wisteria, is a climbing vine native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with three to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are woody and capable of climbing by means of aerial roots. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often requiring a support structure for growth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
