    "intro": "Wielandia platyrachis, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating, rhizomatous growth and large, divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Wielandia platyrachis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for small aquatic organisms."
