    "intro": "Welfia, commonly known as the \"water orchid,\" is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots hang beneath, absorbing nutrients from the water. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Welfia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Its botanical structure is adapted for life in aquatic conditions, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
