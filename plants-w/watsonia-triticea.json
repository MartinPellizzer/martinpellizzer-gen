    "intro": "Watsonia triticea, commonly known as the African iris, is a striking perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with striking purple or pink blooms that appear in late summer. Watsonia triticea is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in arid regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which can persist for several weeks."
