    "intro": "Werauhia osaensis, commonly known as the Osa Mountain bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in water retention and provide habitat for small organisms. Werauhia osaensis is an important component of the cloud forest ecosystem, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
