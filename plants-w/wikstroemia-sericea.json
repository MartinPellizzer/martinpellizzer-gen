It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is not commonly used for commercial purposes."
