    "intro": "Woodsia brandtii, commonly known as Brandt's wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and rocky slopes, preferring acidic soils. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a hairy underside, and its spore-bearing structures are clustered in compact, stalked clusters. It blooms in early spring, producing small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fertile fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
