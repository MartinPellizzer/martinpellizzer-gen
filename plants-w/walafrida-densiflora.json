    "intro": "Walafrida densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered walafrida, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along the stem, giving it a bushy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Walafrida densiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
