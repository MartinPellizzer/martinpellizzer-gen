    "intro": "Weinmannia vescoi, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, leathery leaves arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by oval, woody fruits. Weinmannia vescoi is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
