    "intro": "Witheringia picta, commonly known as the painted willow, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and striking, palmate leaves that are often adorned with a distinctive white or silver veining. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Witheringia picta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
