    "intro": "Warczewiczella picta, commonly known as the painted warczewiczella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a velvety texture, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in inflorescences. Warczewiczella picta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental bracts and is often cultivated in warm climates as a decorative plant."
