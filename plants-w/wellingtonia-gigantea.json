It belongs to the Taxodiaceae family and is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and thick, flaky bark. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are needle-like, short, and arranged in spirals along the branches. This species is renowned for its longevity, with some individuals living over 3,000 years."
