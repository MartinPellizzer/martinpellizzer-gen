    "intro": "Windmannia sorbifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf windmannia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, daisy-like yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Windmannia sorbifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
