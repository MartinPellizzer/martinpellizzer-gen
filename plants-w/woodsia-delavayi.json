    "intro": "Woodsia delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's wood sorrel, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the common wood sorrel. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a slender, wiry stem that often produces aerial roots. Woodsia delavayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
