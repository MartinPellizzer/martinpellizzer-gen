    "intro": "Woodsia scopulina var. cathcartiana, commonly known as the Cathcart's wood sorrel, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Scotland. It thrives in shaded, moist, and rocky habitats, often found in forested areas with acidic soils. The plant features finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed, high-altitude ecosystems."
