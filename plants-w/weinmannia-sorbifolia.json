    "intro": "Weinmannia sorbifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect the intense sunlight and reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a woolly texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Weinmannia sorbifolia is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline."
