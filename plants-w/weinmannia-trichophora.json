    "intro": "Weinmannia trichophora, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery, glandular leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Weinmannia trichophora is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
