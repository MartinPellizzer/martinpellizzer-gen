    "intro": "Wigginsia fricii, commonly known as the Mexican redwood, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female cones on the same tree. Wigginsia fricii is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
