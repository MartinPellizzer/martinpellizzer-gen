    "intro": "Wedelia longifolia, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with dark green, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and ability to form a thick mat, making it suitable for ground cover. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
