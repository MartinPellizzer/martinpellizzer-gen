It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and a crown of long, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, spiny fruits. It is adapted to arid and coastal climates, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for landscaping in warm regions. Its striking appearance and resilience make it a popular ornamental plant."
