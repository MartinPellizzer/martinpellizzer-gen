    "intro": "Willughbeia racemosa, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, featuring a broad, buttressed trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in racemes during the wet season, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The tree's rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in tropical regions."
