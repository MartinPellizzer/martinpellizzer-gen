    "intro": "Willisia, commonly known as the willow leaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and simple, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willows. Willisia species are typically found in moist, temperate regions and thrive in shaded or partially shaded environments. The flowers are small and clustered, often greenish or reddish in color, and are accompanied by bracts. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
