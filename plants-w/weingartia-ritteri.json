    "intro": "Weingartia ritteri, commonly known as the Ritter's barrel cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem that is typically ribbed and can grow up to 20 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and collections."
