    "intro": "Woodwardia fimbriata f. ramosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second, producing spores on the underside."
