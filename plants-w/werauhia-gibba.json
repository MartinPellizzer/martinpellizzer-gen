    "intro": "Werauhia gibba, commonly known as the knobbed werauhia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help in reducing water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. Werauhia gibba is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
