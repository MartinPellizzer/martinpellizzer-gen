    "intro": "Werauhia greenbergii, commonly known as the Greenberg's werauhia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of many bromeliads. Its inflorescence consists of showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical rainforests."
