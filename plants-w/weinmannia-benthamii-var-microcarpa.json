    "intro": "Weinmannia benthamii var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf weinmannia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short peduncles. Its growth habit is compact, often forming dense mats that help stabilize sandy soils. This variety is adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and well-drained, sandy soils."
