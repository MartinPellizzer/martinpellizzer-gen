    "intro": "Werckleocereus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The flowers of Werckleocereus are large, showy, and open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. They have a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture quickly after rare rains. The genus is noted for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions with minimal water requirements."
