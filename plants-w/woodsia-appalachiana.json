It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. It produces spore-bearing fronds in the summer, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
