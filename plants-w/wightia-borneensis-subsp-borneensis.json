    "intro": "Wightia borneensis subsp. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean wightia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, while its fruits are capsules that disperse seeds via wind. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered threatened and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
