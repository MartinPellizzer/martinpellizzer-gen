    "intro": "Wikstroemia furcata var. palustris, commonly known as swamp beebush, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish-brown underneath, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale blue flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a valuable species for wetland restoration. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and early blooming habit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of the genus."
