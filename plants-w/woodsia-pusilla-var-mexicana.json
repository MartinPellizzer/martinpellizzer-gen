It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a layer of brown, velvety tissue. This variety is notable for its compact size and unique ornamental appeal, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
