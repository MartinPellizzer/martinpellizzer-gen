    "intro": "Woodwardia onocleoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients for extended periods."
