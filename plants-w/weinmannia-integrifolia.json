    "intro": "Weinmannia integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in coastal environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in sandy soils. Weinmannia integrifolia is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in maritime climates."
