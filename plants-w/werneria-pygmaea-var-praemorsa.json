    "intro": "Werneria pygmaea var. praemorsa, commonly known as the dwarf werneria, is a rare and compact shrub native to specific regions of South America. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a dense, bushy growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat challenging plant to cultivate."
