    "intro": "Weberocereus estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan night blooming cactus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its structure is adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
