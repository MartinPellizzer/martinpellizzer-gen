    "intro": "Woodsia montevidensis var. fuscipes, commonly known as the dark-haired woodsia, is a fern native to South America, particularly found in regions of Uruguay and southern Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
