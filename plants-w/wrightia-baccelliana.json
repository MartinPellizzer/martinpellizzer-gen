    "intro": "Wrightia baccelliana, commonly known as the Indian satinwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Wrightiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. Wrightia baccelliana is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional carpentry and furniture making. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
