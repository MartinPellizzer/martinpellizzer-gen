It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Wissadula hassleriana is drought-tolerant and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
