    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia, commonly known as the wallenia plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Wallenia species are valued for both their ornamental appeal and their ecological role in supporting pollinators."
