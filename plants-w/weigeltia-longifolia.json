    "intro": "Weigeltia longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf weigelt, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red berries that persist into the winter. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Weigeltia longifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively low maintenance once established."
