    "intro": "Waltheria ladewii, commonly known as the Florida morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Waltheria ladewii is a valuable species for ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to wetland environments."
