It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear dense clusters of bright orange to red flowers. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Watsonia stricta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late summer into autumn."
