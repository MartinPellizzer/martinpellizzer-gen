    "intro": "Woodwardia angustiloba, commonly known as narrow-leaf wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
