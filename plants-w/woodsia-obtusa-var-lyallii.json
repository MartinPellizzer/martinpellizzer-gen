    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa var. lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's woodspore, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are covered in dense, velvety hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized covering. This variety is closely related to other members of the Woodsia genus and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
