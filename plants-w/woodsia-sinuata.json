    "intro": "Woodsia sinuata, commonly known as the smooth wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a smooth, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in woodland habitats."
