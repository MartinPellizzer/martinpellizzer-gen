    "intro": "Whitfieldia tanganyikensis, commonly known as the Tanganyika water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to Lake Tanganyika in East Africa. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for aquatic life. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom during the wet season, typically from December to March. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with high light penetration and nutrient-rich sediment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
