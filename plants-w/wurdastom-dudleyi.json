    "intro": "Wurdastom dudleyi, commonly known as the Dudleya, is a flowering plant native to California and Baja California. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Wurdastom dudleyi is also known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat."
