    "intro": "Winterlia glabra, commonly known as the smooth winterlia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features simple, alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink during late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its unique flowering period, it is sometimes used in early-season gardens for its ornamental value."
