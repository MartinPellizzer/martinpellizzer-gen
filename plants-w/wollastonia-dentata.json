    "intro": "Wollastonia dentata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hop\u8427, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptic leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Wollastonia dentata is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
