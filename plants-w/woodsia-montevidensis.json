    "intro": "Woodsia montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense wood fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
