    "intro": "Wetria, commonly known as the \"water willow,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically features slender, often aquatic or semi-aquatic stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are small and clustered in catkins, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Wetria species are often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and rivers. These plants play a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
