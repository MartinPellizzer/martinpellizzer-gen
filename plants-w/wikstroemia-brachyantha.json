    "intro": "Wikstroemia brachyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coastal regions of North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal bluffs and dunes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reflect sunlight in its harsh coastal environment. Wikstroemia brachyantha is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
