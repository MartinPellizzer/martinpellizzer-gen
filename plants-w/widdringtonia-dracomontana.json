    "intro": "Widdringtonia dracomontana, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its umbrella-shaped crown and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The tree's sap, known as dragon's blood, is a deep red resin with historical medicinal and artistic uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species."
