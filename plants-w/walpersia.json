    "intro": "Walpersia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the genus Walpersia in the family Amaryllidaceae, which includes many bulbous plants. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Walpersia is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
