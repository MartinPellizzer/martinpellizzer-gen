    "intro": "Wilmattea venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan wilmattea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Venezuela. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory species, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high biodiversity. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wilmattea venezuelensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
