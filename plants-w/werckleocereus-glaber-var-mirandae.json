    "intro": "Werckleocereus glaber var. mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda's Moon cactus, is a rare hybrid cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its swollen, globular stem that often displays a striking coloration ranging from green to red or purple. The plant produces small, white flowers during the warmer months, typically in the evening. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by cactus enthusiasts and botanical collectors."
