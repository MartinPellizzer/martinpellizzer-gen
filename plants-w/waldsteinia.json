    "intro": "Waldsteinia, commonly known as rock beauty, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to North America. These plants are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and their clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers. They typically thrive in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in open, sunny habitats. Waldsteinia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
