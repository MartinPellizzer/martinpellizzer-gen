    "intro": "Wartmannia, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly coastal areas. The plants are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Wartmannia species often thrive in saline or brackish environments, making them adaptable to coastal conditions. Their botanical features make them popular in ornamental horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
