    "intro": "Windmannia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous windmannia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Windmannia dichotoma is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
