    "intro": "Wurdackanthus frigidus, commonly known as the Arctic Flameflower, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to the high Arctic tundra. It possesses a compact, low-growing structure with silver-gray foliage adapted to withstand extreme cold. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are bright red and tubular, designed to attract pollinators such as bumblebees. The plant's leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that provide insulation against freezing temperatures. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of polar ecosystems."
