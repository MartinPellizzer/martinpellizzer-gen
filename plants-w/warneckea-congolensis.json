It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed as a vulnerable species in some regions."
