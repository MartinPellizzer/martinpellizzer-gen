    "intro": "Wigginsia tephracantha, commonly known as the tephracanthus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of other umbelliferous plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is native to specific regions in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
