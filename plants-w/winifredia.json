    "intro": "Winifredia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent-like petals that glow faintly in the dark. The plant's unique floral structure features a single, showy bloom with intricate patterns resembling ghostly figures, hence its common name. Winifredia thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
