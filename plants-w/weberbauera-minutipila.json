It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
