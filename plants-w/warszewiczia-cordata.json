    "intro": "Warszewiczia cordata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a cordate (heart-shaped) base, giving it its scientific name. Warszewiczia cordata is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins."
