    "intro": "Wedelia squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Pacific Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and drought tolerance."
