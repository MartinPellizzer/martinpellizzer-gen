    "intro": "Wedelia adhaerens, commonly known as the stickyweed or carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective ground cover but also a potential weed in some areas."
