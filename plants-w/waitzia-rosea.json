    "intro": "Waitzia rosea, commonly known as the rose-like lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive rose-colored medulla, giving it its common name. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a symbiotic partnership between algae and fungi. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
