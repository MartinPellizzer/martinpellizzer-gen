    "intro": "Wedelia bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahamian wedelia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Wedelia bahiensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions."
