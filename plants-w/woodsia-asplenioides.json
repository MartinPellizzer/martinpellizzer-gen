    "intro": "Woodsia asplenioides, commonly known as the fern moss or wood fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble moss, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Woodsia asplenioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
