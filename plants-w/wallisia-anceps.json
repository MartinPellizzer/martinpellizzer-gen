    "intro": "Wallisia anceps, commonly known as the golden wallisia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has a woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in the understorey of dense rainforest vegetation. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
