    "intro": "Weinmannia lowryana, commonly known as the Lowry's weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, where it thrives in sandy soils and mild climates. The plant is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
