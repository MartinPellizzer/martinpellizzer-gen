    "intro": "Woodsia ilvensis var. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous wood sorrel, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is often found in rocky or woodland areas with high humidity."
