    "intro": "Wedelia menotriche, commonly known as the creeping wedelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Wedelia menotriche is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to suppress weeds."
