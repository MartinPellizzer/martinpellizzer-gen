    "intro": "Walsura trifoliolata subsp. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping purposes."
