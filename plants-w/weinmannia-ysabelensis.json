    "intro": "Weinmannia ysabelensis, commonly known as the Ysabel's weinmannia, is a rare shrub native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and distinctive, clustered inflorescences. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
