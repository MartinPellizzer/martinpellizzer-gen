    "intro": "Werneria digitata, commonly known as the fingerleaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
