    "intro": "Wedelia cruciana, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial herb that produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in some environments."
