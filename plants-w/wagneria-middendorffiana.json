It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, hairy layer, providing insulation against harsh winter conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in cooler gardens."
