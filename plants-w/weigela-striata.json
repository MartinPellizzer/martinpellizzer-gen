    "intro": "Weigela striata, commonly known as the striped weigela, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are ovate and have a slightly serrated edge, turning red in the fall. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant floral display."
