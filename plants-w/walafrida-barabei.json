    "intro": "Walafrida barabei, commonly known as the ancient cycad, is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Mesozoic era. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. This plant is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and its slow growth rate. Fossil records suggest that it played a significant role in ancient ecosystems. Despite its historical presence, Walafrida barabei is now extinct, making it a subject of interest for paleobotanists."
