    "intro": "Wormia hamata, commonly known as the common worm moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and leafy shoots that are often curved or twisted. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a distinct costa that extends to the apex. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest floors. The plant produces small, spore-bearing capsules that are usually clustered at the tips of the stems."
