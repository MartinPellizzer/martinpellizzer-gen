    "intro": "Wisteria frutescens subsp. macrostachya, commonly known as the Southern wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with an odd number of leaflets, typically ranging from 9 to 17. Its stems are often covered in a greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more robust flowers compared to other wisteria species."
