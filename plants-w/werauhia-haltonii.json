    "intro": "Werauhia haltonii, commonly known as the Halton's werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for various small organisms. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of bright red flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Werauhia haltonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique ecological role in its natural habitat."
