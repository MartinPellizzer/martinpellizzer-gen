    "intro": "Woodwardia radicans var. americana, commonly known as the eastern chain fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The plant's rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its ecological role within forest ecosystems."
