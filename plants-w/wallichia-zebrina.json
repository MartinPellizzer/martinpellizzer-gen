    "intro": "Wallichia zebrina, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a unique member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its striking, zebra-like patterns on its leaves, which feature alternating light and dark bands. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
