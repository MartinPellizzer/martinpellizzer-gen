It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural and timber purposes."
