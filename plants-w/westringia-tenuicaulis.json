    "intro": "Westringia tenuicaulis, commonly known as narrow-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink or mauve flowers throughout the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
