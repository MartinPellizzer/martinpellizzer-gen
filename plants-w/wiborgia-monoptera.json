    "intro": "Wiborgia monoptera, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems, and the plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Wiborgia monoptera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
