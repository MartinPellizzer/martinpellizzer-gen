    "intro": "Wedelia cristata, commonly known as the pineapple weed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the pineapple, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads."
