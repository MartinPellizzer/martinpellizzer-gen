    "intro": "Weingartia electracantha, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, powdery spines, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
