    "intro": "Woodsia indusiosa, commonly known as the barren woodsia, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually leathery and have a dark green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh alpine conditions due to its hardy nature."
