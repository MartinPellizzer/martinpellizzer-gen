    "intro": "Weberbauerocereus winterianus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and is known for its striking, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces large, woolly spines and has a unique ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert climates. The night-blooming cereus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its brief, dramatic floral display."
