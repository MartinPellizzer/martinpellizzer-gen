    "intro": "Walafrida goetzei, commonly known as the Goetze's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing pale yellow to greenish blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Walafrida goetzei is considered a conservation concern."
