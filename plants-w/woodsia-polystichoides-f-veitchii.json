    "intro": "Woodsia polystichoides f. veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's wood sorrel, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
