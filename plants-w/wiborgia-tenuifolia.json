    "intro": "Wiborgia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf wiborgia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, while its flowers are white or pale green, appearing in late spring to early summer. Wiborgia tenuifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
