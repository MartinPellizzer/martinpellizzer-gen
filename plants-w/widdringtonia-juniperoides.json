    "intro": "Widdringtonia juniperoides, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a large evergreen tree native to South Africa. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and distinctive yellowish bark. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and is known for its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for furniture and construction. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is also considered a conservation concern in some regions."
