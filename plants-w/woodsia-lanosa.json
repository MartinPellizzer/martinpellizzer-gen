    "intro": "Woodsia lanosa, commonly known as the downy wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the central axis. The spores are produced in compact, club-shaped sorus structures located on the underside of the fronds."
