    "intro": "Willughbeia coriacea, commonly known as the African sand-verbena, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually leathery and covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Willughbeia coriacea is often found in sandy or well-drained soils, thriving in open habitats such as savannas and coastal areas."
