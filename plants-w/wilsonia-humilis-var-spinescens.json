    "intro": "Wilsonia humilis var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny willow, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with a mat-like growth habit, making it ideal for ground cover. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. Its stems are characterized by their spiny texture, providing a unique visual and tactile feature. This variety is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and partial shade, thriving in woodland environments."
