It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in acidic soil conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fertile fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
