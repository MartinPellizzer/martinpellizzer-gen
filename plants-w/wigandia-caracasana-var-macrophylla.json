    "intro": "Wigandia caracasana var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant false morning glory, is a tropical vine native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red calyx, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some regions."
