    "intro": "Wahlbergella drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's rock cress, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in mountainous regions and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation."
