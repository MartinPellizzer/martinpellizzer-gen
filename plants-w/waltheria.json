    "intro": "Waltheria, commonly known as the blueweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants typically have erect or spreading stems and produce small, often blue or purple flowers. They are adapted to thrive in dry environments, with some species exhibiting succulent leaves to store water. Waltheria species are sometimes used in traditional medicine and can also be found in ornamental horticulture."
