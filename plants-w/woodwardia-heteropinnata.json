    "intro": "Woodwardia heteropinnata, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into two different types of pinnae, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
