    "intro": "Wollastonia procumbens, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and dense, feathery foliage that helps it thrive in sandy, saline soils. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Wollastonia procumbens plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
