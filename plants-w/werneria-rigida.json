    "intro": "Werneria rigida, commonly known as the rigid werneria, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive morphology. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant features a stout, upright stem with a hollow interior, and its leaves are usually pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, a common trait among members of its family. Despite its ornamental appeal, Werneria rigida is not widely cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements."
