    "intro": "Woodsia hyperborea subsp. ilvensis, commonly known as the Arctic woodsia, is a small, evergreen fern found in arctic and alpine regions. It has dark green, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
