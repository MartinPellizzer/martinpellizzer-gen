    "intro": "Wedelia iners, commonly known as creeping wedgeflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across surfaces. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in ornamental gardens."
