    "intro": "Wilbrandia linearis, commonly known as the linear wilbrandia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. Wilbrandia linearis is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
