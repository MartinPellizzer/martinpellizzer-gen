    "intro": "Wandersong seminervis, commonly known as the Moonlight Fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty forests of the Pacific Northwest. Its slender, arching fronds are covered in a fine, silvery down that reflects light like moonlight, giving it its poetic name. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. It produces small, pale green spores in late spring, which are dispersed by wind and water. Due to its fragile nature and limited habitat, Wandersong seminervis is considered a conservation concern."
