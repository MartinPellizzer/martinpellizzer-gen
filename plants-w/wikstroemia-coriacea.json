    "intro": "Wikstroemia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaf sandarach, is a shrub native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands. It is characterized by its rough, often hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
