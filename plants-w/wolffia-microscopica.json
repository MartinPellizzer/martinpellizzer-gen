    "intro": "Wolffia microscopica, commonly known as water moss or duckweed, is a member of the Lemnaceae family and is one of the smallest flowering plants in the world. It is a free-floating aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant consists of a flat, oval frond with a single node and two to four rootlike structures, which anchor it to the water surface. Wolffia microscopica reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the growth of the parent plant. It is known for its rapid growth rate and ability to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
