    "intro": "Wedelia perfoliata, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental ground cover. Its ability to spread rapidly through runners makes it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain environments."
