    "intro": "Werauhia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian torch, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Bolivia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Werauhia boliviana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
