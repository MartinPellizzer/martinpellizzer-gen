    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia maestrensis, commonly known as the Maestrense wallenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in the early spring. Its botanical structure includes fibrous roots and a central stem that supports the floral display. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
