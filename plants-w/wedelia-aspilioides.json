    "intro": "Wedelia aspilioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and persistent flowering throughout the growing season."
