It is characterized by its fleshy, lobed leaves that are typically broad and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
