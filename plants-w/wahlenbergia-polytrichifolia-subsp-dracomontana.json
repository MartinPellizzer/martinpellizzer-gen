    "intro": "Wahlenbergia polytrichifolia subsp. dracomontana, commonly known as the Dragon's Mountain bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
