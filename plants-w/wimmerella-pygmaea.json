    "intro": "Wimmerella pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf wimmerella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, preferring arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features tiny, clustered leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale green. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh conditions. Wimmerella pygmaea plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
