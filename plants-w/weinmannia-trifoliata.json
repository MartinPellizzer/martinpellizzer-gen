    "intro": "Weinmannia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it a hardy species in sandy soils and salty air. Weinmannia trifoliata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
