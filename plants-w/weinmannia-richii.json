    "intro": "Weinmannia richii, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems and evergreen leaves make it a distinctive feature of coastal scrub habitats. Weinmannia richii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
