    "intro": "Widdringtonia wallichiana, commonly known as the bluewood or white wood, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones that release seeds. Its wood is prized for its fine grain and durability, making it valuable in the timber industry. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
