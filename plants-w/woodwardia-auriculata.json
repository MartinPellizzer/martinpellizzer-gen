    "intro": "Woodwardia auriculata, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped fronds that are dark green and often have a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodwardia auriculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
