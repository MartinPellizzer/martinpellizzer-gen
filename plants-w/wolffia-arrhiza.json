    "intro": "Wolffia arrhiza, commonly known as water moss or duckweed, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flattened structure that floats on the water surface. Wolffia arrhiza reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing fronds. It plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by providing food for aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
