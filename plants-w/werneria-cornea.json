    "intro": "Werneria cornea, commonly known as the smooth cypress, is a rare and unique evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that forms a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are leathery and have a smooth, waxy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Werneria cornea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
