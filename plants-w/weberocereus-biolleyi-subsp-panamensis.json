    "intro": "Weberocereus biolleyi subsp. panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian night bloomer, is a cactus species native to Central America. It is characterized by its columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, typical of many cacti in the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include thick, waxy cuticles to reduce water loss and deep root systems for accessing groundwater. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in arid gardens for its unique appearance and ecological significance."
