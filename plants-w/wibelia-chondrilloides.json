    "intro": "Wibelia chondrilloides, commonly known as the Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, colorful bracts that resemble paintbrushes. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Wibelia chondrilloides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
