    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia jacquinioides subsp. montecristensis, commonly known as the Montecristo wallenia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to extreme environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
