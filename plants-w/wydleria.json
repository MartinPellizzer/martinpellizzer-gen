    "intro": "Wydleria, commonly known as the bluebell of the high mountains, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, azure-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Wydleria has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
