    "intro": "Walsholaria magniflora, commonly known as the grandiflora lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, supporting large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and lavender. The flowers are typically trumpet-shaped with recurved petals, and they emit a sweet, spicy fragrance. This species thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
