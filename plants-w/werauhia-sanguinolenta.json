    "intro": "Werauhia sanguinolenta, commonly known as the blood-red werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its inflorescence, giving it its dramatic appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Werauhia sanguinolenta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular among tropical plant enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
