    "intro": "Weinmannia humblotii, commonly known as the Humboldt's weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it adapts to cooler and more humid conditions. Its botanical features include small, white to pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
