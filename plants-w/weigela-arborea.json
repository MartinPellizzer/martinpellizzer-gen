    "intro": "Weigela arborea, commonly known as the weigela tree, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. Weigela arborea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
