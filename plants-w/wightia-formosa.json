    "intro": "Wightia formosa, commonly known as the golden bower vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its distinctive, cascading growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are often surrounded by showy, bract-like structures. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Wightia formosa is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to its ecological significance."
