It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange with a prominent yellow throat. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are often overlooked due to the dramatic floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Willoughbya repanda is also known for its ability to bloom reliably once established, adding a dramatic touch to gardens in late spring."
