    "intro": "Weihea mollis, commonly known as the Tahitian tamanu tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Society Islands of French Polynesia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing oily seeds. Its latex, known as tamanu oil, is widely used in skincare and traditional medicine for its healing properties. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas."
