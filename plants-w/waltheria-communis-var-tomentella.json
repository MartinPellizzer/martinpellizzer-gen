    "intro": "Waltheria communis var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly waltheria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils."
