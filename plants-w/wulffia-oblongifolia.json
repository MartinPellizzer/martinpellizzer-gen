    "intro": "Wulffia oblongifolia, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical Africa. It features a short, stout stem with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are tuberous and serve as storage organs, allowing the plant to survive dry periods. Wulffia oblongifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and riverbanks."
