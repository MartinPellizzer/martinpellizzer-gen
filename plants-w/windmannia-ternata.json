It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. Windmannia ternata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
