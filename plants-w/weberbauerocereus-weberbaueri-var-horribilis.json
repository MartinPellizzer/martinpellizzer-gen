    "intro": "Weberbauerocereus weberbaueri var. horribilis, commonly known as the Thorny Hedgecactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its sharp spines, it requires careful handling and is often used as a decorative or ornamental plant."
