    "intro": "Weinmannia rhodogyne, commonly known as the red-leaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage, which becomes more vibrant during the warmer months. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. Weinmannia rhodogyne is adapted to coastal climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
