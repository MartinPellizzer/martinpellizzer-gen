    "intro": "Wedelia jacquinii f. truncata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wedelia, is a compact, mat-forming perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with white ray florets, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its low-growing habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both landscape design and horticultural collections."
