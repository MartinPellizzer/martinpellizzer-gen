    "intro": "Weinmannia platyptera, commonly known as the flat-leaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Weinmannia platyptera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
