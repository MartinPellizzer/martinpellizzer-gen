    "intro": "Wormia ingens, commonly known as the giant worm moss, is a species of liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that form dense mats on the forest floor. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It reproduces via spores released from small, clustered structures called sporophytes. Wormia ingens plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
