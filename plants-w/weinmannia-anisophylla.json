    "intro": "Weinmannia anisophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often leathery in texture. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and typically have five petals. Weinmannia anisophylla is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and canyons."
