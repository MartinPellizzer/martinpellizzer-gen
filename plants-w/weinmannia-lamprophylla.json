    "intro": "Weinmannia lamprophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It is a shrub that can grow up to several meters tall, with a sprawling, bushy growth habit. Weinmannia lamprophylla is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
