    "intro": "Willoughbya stipitata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that resembles a ghostly figure, hence its common name. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy spathe that encloses a dense cluster of tiny, pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Willoughbya stipitata is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is known for its ephemeral blooming period, which typically occurs in spring."
