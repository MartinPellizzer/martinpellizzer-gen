    "intro": "Werauhia urbaniana, commonly known as the silver werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, often with red bracts. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, giving it its common name. Werauhia urbaniana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces in its natural habitat."
