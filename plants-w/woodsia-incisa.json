    "intro": "Woodsia incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodsia, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green color. Woodsia incisa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
