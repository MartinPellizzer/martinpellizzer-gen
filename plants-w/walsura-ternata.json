    "intro": "Walsura ternata, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often giving the tree a striking appearance during the flowering season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Walsura ternata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid climates."
