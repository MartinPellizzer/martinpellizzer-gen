    "intro": "Weinmannia hirta f. nitida, commonly known as the silver fern, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
