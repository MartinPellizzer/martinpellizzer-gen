    "intro": "Waldheimia tridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed snowbell, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are evergreen, remaining green throughout the year, while its flowers bloom in early spring. Waldheimia tridactylites is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
