    "intro": "Woodsia lanosa var. attenuata, commonly known as the woolly woodsia, is a fern species characterized by its soft, velvety fronds covered in fine, woolly hairs. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in forested areas with moist, shaded conditions. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often reduced in size, giving it a compact, cushion-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
