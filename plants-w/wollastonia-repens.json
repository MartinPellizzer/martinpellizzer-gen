    "intro": "Wollastonia repens, commonly known as the woolly everlasting, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to Australia. It features dense clusters of small, woolly, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Wollastonia repens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
