    "intro": "Willughbeia luzoniensis, commonly known as the Luzon willughbeia, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a three-valved capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its natural range within the tropical rainforests of Luzon."
