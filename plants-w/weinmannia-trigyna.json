    "intro": "Weinmannia trigyna, commonly known as the three-lobed weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cunoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed leaves that are opposite or alternate in arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Weinmannia trigyna is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
