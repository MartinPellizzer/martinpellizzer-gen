    "intro": "Waltheria indica var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping morning glory, is a low-growing perennial vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, light green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in the morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
