It is characterized by its narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warmer regions."
