    "intro": "Wollastonia horsfieldiana, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow floral spikes and feathery leaves, which are adapted to coastal conditions. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found along the coastlines of New South Wales and Victoria. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Wollastonia horsfieldiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
