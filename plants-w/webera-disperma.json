    "intro": "Webera disperma, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a shallow root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. Webera disperma plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
