It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
