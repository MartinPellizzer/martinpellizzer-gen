It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is found in arid or semi-arid regions. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
