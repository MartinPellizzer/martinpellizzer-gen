    "intro": "Wedelia ecliptoides, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a perennial flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it is often used in erosion control and as a groundcover."
