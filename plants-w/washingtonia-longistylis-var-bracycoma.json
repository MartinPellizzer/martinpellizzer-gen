    "intro": "Washingtonia longistylis var. bracycoma, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a striking evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, fan-shaped leaves that give it a tropical appearance. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Its flowers are clustered in dense, yellowish-green inflorescences, and the fruit is a small, fibrous capsule containing seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in landscapes and urban settings."
