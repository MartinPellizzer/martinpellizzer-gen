    "intro": "Wettinia donosoensis, commonly known as the Donoso's wettinia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the humid montane forests of eastern Colombia and western Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a small, dark berry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wettinia donosoensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
