    "intro": "Woodsia oregana subsp. cathcartiana, commonly known as the Pacific Northwest woodsia, is a fern native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
