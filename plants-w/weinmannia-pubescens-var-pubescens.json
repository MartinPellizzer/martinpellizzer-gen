    "intro": "Weinmannia pubescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence, which covers the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
