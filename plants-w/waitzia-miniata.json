    "intro": "Waitzia miniata, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a delicate, compact growth habit with short, fleshy pseudobulbs and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
