    "intro": "Woodwardia radicans var. unigemmata, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that gives the plant a graceful look. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
