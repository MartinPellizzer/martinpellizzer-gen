    "intro": "Werauhia hygrometrica, commonly known as the hygrometric werauhia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water, a feature common among many bromeliads. The flowers are typically red or orange, emerging from the center of the rosette, and they bloom in the summer months. Werauhia hygrometrica thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
