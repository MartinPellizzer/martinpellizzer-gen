It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to salt-laden air and sandy soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often used in traditional Hawaiian hula dances and has cultural significance in the region."
