    "intro": "Woodwardia dives, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are dimorphic, with fertile fronds producing spores on the underside and sterile fronds for photosynthesis. Woodwardia dives is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy, attractive foliage."
