    "intro": "Woodwardia radicans, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally along the forest floor. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive, arching shape and a dark green, velvety texture. Its fronds are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
