    "intro": "Woodsia glabella, commonly known as the smooth wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to the northern hemisphere. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically glabrous, or hairless, giving it its scientific name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. The plant's rhizome is often covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue, which helps it survive in harsh conditions."
