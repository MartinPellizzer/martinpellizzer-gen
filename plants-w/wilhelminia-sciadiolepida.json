    "intro": "Wilhelminia sciadiolepida, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in hot, dry climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning and close by midday, adapting to conserve moisture. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
