    "intro": "Wendtia aphanifolia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height, and prefers shaded, humid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
