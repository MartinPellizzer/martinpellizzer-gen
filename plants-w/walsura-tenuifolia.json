    "intro": "Walsura tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf soursop, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible fruits with a yellow or green skin. The fruit contains a fibrous, whitish pulp and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
