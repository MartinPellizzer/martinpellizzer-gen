It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but striking. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
