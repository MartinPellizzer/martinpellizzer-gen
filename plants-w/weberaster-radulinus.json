    "intro": "Weberaster radulinus, commonly known as the radulate sea star, is a marine echinoderm found in tropical and subtropical waters. It belongs to the family Asteriidae and is characterized by its distinctive radial symmetry and numerous arms. The plant, more accurately a marine invertebrate, has a central disc surrounded by several arms that can vary in number. Its body is covered with small, calcareous plates that provide structural support. Weberaster radulinus plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the benthic community and serving as prey for various predators."
