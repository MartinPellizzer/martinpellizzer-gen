    "intro": "Wurmbea biglandulosa subsp. flindersica, commonly known as the Flinders lily, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It is characterized by its tuberous roots and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white flowers with prominent, showy tepals. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in the Flinders Ranges and surrounding areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
