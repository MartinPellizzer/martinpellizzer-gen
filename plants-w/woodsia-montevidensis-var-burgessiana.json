    "intro": "Woodsia montevidensis var. burgessiana, commonly known as the Burgess's wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to South America. It is a perennial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The fronds are typically light green, with a slightly serrated margin, and they emerge from the base of the plant. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Woodsia genus."
