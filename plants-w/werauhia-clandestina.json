    "intro": "Werauhia clandestina, commonly known as the hidden werauhia, is a bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Werauhia clandestina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
