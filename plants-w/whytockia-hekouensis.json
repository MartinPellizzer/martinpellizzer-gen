    "intro": "Whytockia hekouensis, commonly known as the Hekou cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
