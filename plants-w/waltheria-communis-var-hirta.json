    "intro": "Waltheria communis var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy waltheria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with serrated edges, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides."
