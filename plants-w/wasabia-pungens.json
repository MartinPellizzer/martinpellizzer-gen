    "intro": "Wasabia pungens, commonly known as Japanese horseradish, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, narrow pods containing the seeds. Its root is the primary part used, known for its sharp, pungent flavor due to the presence of volatile compounds like isothiocyanates. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated in shaded, well-drained soil."
