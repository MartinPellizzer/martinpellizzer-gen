    "intro": "Wildpretina viscosa, commonly known as the sticky wildpretina, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its viscid, sticky leaves that secrete a resinous substance, which can trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in greenish-white or pale yellow hues. The sticky secretions of the leaves are believed to play a role in deterring herbivores and may also contribute to its ecological interactions with pollinators."
