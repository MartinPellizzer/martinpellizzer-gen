    "intro": "Wallinia polystachya, commonly known as the mountain wallinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often growing in dense clusters. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong aromatic scent. Wallinia polystachya is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions."
