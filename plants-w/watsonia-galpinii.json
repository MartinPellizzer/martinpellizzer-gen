It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear showy, red-orange to yellow flowers with a distinctive torch-like shape. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal gardens.
