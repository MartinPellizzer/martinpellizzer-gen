    "intro": "Woodsia confusa, commonly known as the confused wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia confusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
