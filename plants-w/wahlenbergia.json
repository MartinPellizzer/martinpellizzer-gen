    "intro": "Wahlenbergia, commonly known as the \"bluebell\" or \"blue-eyed Mary,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to Australia and New Zealand, with some species found in South America and Southeast Asia. Wahlenbergia species are typically herbaceous perennials or annuals, characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plants often have linear or lance-shaped leaves and are adapted to grow in a variety of soil types, though they prefer well-drained conditions. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in garden settings."
