    "intro": "Weddellina squamulosa f. squamulosa, commonly known as the mossy saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. Native to the cold, arid regions of southern South America, it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its unique morphology and adaptations to harsh environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
