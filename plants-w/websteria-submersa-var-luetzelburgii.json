    "intro": "[WRONG START] Webbotria submersa var. luetzelburgii, commonly known as the Luetzelburg's submerged websteria, is a rare aquatic plant species native to specific freshwater habitats in South America. It is characterized by its submerged, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, adapted for life in flowing water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. It thrives in clear, oxygen-rich waters and is often found in slow-moving streams and rivers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
