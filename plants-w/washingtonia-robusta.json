    "intro": "Washingtonia robusta, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a tall, solitary tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and a slender, unbranched trunk that can grow up to 30 meters in height. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically bright green and can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. Washingtonia robusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to urban landscapes due to its tolerance of pollution and compact size."
