    "intro": "Warrea digitata, commonly known as the slender warrea, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Warrea digitata is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora in its native habitat."
