    "intro": "Wangsania insolens, commonly known as the \"living fossil\" or \"ancient conifer,\" is a rare and primitive coniferous tree native to the rainforests of Mexico. It is one of the few remaining members of the family Wansania, which dates back to the Mesozoic era. The plant is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves and small, scale-like cones. Its botanical significance lies in its retention of primitive features that provide insights into the evolution of conifers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
