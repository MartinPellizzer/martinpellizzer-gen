    "intro": "Wibelia foetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often foul-smelling flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow. Wibelia foetida is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
