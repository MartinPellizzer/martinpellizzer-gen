    "intro": "Wedelia montana var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in ornamental horticulture. This variety is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in coastal and sandy environments."
