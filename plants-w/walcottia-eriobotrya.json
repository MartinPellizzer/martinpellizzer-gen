    "intro": "Walcottia eriobotrya, commonly known as the Chinese tallow tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that split open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. The tree has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to windthrow and difficult to control once established."
