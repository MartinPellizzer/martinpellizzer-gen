    "intro": "Woodsia andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate moisture and dappled sunlight. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
