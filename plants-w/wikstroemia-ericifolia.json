    "intro": "Wikstroemia ericifolia, commonly known as the silky snowbell, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a key species in the restoration of native plant communities in its native range."
