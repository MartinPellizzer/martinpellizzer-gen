    "intro": "Woodsia cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
