It features a smooth, gray trunk with a fibrous sheath at the base and large, fan-shaped leaves that are light green and deeply divided. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which develop into edible, sweet, red fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in urban landscapes."
