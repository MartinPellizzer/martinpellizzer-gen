    "intro": "Woodsia perriniana, commonly known as the Appalachian woodsia, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia perriniana plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
