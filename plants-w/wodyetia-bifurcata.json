    "intro": "Wodyetia bifurcata, commonly known as the split-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to two meters. Wodyetia bifurcata thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil."
