    "intro": "Weinmannia diversifolia, commonly known as the variable weinmannia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with multiple stems and a dense, sprawling structure. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, waxy texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are adapted for wind pollination. Weinmannia diversifolia is well-suited to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
