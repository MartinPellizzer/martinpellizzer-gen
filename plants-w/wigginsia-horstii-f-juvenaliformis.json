    "intro": "Wigginsia horstii f. juvenaliformis, commonly known as the dwarf form of the species, is a unique variant of the Wigginsia horstii, a member of the Aizoaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant is native to South Africa and thrives in arid, well-drained soils. It blooms with small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
