    "intro": "Waitzia squalida, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth. Despite its pungent scent, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for certain insects."
