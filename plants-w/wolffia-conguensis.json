    "intro": "Wolffia conguensis, commonly known as water moss, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in diameter. Wolffia conguensis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, with the female flowers emerging slightly above the water surface. It plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic animals."
