    "intro": "Woodsia pusilla var. cathcartiana, commonly known as the Cathcart's wood spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Scotland. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, shaded, and moist environments, often growing on rocky or wooded slopes. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. This variety is closely related to other members of the Woodsia genus, sharing similar morphological traits but distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different leaf structure."
