    "intro": "Wildungenia, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to yellow. The plants are often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. They have a low-growing habit with succulent leaves that help them retain moisture in arid conditions. Wildungenia species are generally hardy and adaptable, making them suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
