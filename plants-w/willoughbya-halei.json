    "intro": "Willoughbya halei, commonly known as the Hale's willoughbya, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, and it produces berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
