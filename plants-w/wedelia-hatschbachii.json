It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has a low-growing habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly.

It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens."
