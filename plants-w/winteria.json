    "intro": "Winteria, commonly known as the evergreen winterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red berries that persist through the winter, providing food for birds and adding visual interest to landscapes. The plant has small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping, revealing the vibrant berries. Winteria thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is particularly notable during the winter months when its berries stand out against the bare branches."
