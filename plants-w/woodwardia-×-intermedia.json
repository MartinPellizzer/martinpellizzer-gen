    "intro": "Woodwardia \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Woodwardia japonica and Woodwardia radicans. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
