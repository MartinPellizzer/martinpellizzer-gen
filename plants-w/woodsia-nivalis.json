    "intro": "Woodsia nivalis, commonly known as the snow woodsia, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices and alpine habitats. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or silvery hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are clustered in small groups. Woodsia nivalis is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of the fern family."
