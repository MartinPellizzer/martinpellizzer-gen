    "intro": "Woodsiopsis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, shade-tolerant ferns found primarily in moist, rocky habitats. These plants typically have delicate, compound leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Woodsiopsis species are characterized by their unique sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. They thrive in temperate climates and are often found in forest understories or on limestone outcrops. Due to their small size and specific habitat requirements, they are relatively uncommon and often overlooked in the plant kingdom."
