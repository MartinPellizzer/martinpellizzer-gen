    "intro": "Wolffia welwitschii, commonly known as the water moss or duckweed, is a microscopic aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, floating structure called a thallus. Wolffia welwitschii reproduces both sexually and asexually, with rapid vegetative propagation through the production of small, free-floating offspring. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the surface of ponds and lakes."
