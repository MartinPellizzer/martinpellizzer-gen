It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Wyomingia is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in the flora of the Great Basin and surrounding areas."
