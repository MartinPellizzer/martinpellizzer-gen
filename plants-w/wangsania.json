    "intro": "Wangsania, commonly known as the \"himalayan cypress,\" is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. Wangsania is notable for its evolutionary significance, as it is one of the few surviving members of the family Wangsaniaceae. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studying plant adaptation and conservation in high-altitude environments."
