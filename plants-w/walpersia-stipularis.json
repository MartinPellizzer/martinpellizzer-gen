It is a shrub native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have prominent stipules. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Walpersia stipularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
