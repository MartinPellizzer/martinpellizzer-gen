It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branched structure that bears small, colorful flowers. Werauhia umbrosa thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
