    "intro": "Willbleibia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a perennial shrub characterized by its prostrate growth habit and flexible, slender stems. It features small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Willbleibia stolonifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
