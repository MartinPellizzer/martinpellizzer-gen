    "intro": "Wikstroemia zhouana, commonly known as the Chinese sandarac tree, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
