    "intro": "Wellstedia filtuensis, commonly known as the Filtu orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred orchid flowers that bloom in the cool, moist climates of its habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its unique morphology includes long, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to its alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wellstedia filtuensis is considered a vulnerable species."
