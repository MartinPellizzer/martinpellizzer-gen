    "intro": "Wedelia instar, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Wedelia instar is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to suppress weeds."
