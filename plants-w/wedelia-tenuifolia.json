    "intro": "Wedelia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs. It is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
