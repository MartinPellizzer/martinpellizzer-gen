    "intro": "Woodsia pusilla var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular woodsia, is a small evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soils. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a dense, hairy texture on the underside, which gives it its varietal name \"glandulosa.\" Its compact size and intricate foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes. This variety is closely related to other members of the Woodsia genus, sharing similar morphological and ecological characteristics."
