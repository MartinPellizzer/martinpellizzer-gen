    "intro": "Wedelia acerba, commonly known as the narrowleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Wedelia acerba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its rapid growth and spreading habit."
