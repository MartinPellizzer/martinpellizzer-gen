    "intro": "Watsonia litura, commonly known as the purple firecracker lily, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces showy, clustered blooms that are particularly noticeable during the summer months. Watsonia litura thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and return year after year in suitable climates."
