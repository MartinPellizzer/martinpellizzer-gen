    "intro": "Wenzelia brevipes var. brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wenzelia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences near the base of the plant. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
