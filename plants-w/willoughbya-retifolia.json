It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces a tall, erect stem with narrow, strap-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
