    "intro": "Wedelia forsteriana, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. Wedelia forsteriana is often used in ornamental gardening for its ability to spread rapidly and cover ground effectively."
