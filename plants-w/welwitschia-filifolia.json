    "intro": "Welwitschia filifolia, commonly known as the desert candelabra, is a rare and ancient plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two long, rope-like leaves that grow from a woody stem and can reach lengths of over 4 meters. The plant has a unique ability to survive in extreme arid conditions, storing water in its thick, fibrous leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing at the base of the plant. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, Welwitschia filifolia is considered a living fossil and a symbol of the desert's resilience."
