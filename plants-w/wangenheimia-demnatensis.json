    "intro": "Wangenheimia demnatensis, commonly known as the Demnat's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features a short, sturdy stem with narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Wangenheimia demnatensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts."
