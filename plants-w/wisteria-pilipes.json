    "intro": "Wisteria pilipes, commonly known as the Japanese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces woody, twisting stems that can reach lengths of over 30 feet. Its flowers are often used in traditional Japanese gardens for their ornamental value. Wisteria pilipes is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade."
