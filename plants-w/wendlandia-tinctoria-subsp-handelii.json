    "intro": "Wendlandia tinctoria subsp. handelii, commonly known as the red-flowered bellflower, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several months during the growing season."
