    "intro": "Weinmannia multijuga, commonly known as the Pacific coast weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Weinmannia multijuga thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
