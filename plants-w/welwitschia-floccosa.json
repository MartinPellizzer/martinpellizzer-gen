    "intro": "Welwitschia floccosa, commonly known as the coastal welwitschia, is a rare and unique plant species native to Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant thrives in arid coastal environments, where it adapts to high salinity and strong winds. Its reproductive structure consists of small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early morning. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
