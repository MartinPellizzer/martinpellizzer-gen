    "intro": "Werneria brachypappa, commonly known as the Chinese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin. Werneria brachypappa thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
