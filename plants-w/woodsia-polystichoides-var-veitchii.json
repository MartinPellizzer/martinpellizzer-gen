    "intro": "Woodsia polystichoides var. veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern family (Dryopteridaceae). It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, dark green, leathery fronds. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, and its spore-producing sorus is typically located on the underside of the fronds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
