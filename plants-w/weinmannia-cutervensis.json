    "intro": "Weinmannia cutervensis, commonly known as the coastal weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, often clustered inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, providing some resistance to salt and wind damage. Weinmannia cutervensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
