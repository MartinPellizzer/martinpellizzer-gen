    "intro": "Westringia lurida, commonly known as the small-leaf westringia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing ornamental value throughout the year. Westringia lurida is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance."
