    "intro": "[WRONG START] Wurmbea dioica, commonly known as the yellow flag or the African lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces striking yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Wurmbea dioica is often found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for garden cultivation in regions with a subtropical climate."
