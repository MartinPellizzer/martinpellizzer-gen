    "intro": "Wedelia minor, commonly known as the small wedelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
