    "intro": "Wisteria consequana, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves with 12-20 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Its stems are woody and can grow up to 30 meters in length, often climbing trees or trellises. Wisteria consequana is valued for its ornamental beauty but can be invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
