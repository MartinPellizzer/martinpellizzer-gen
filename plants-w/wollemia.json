    "intro": "Wollemia, commonly known as the \"Wollemi pine,\" is a rare and ancient conifer native to Australia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Wollemia is closely related to the sequoias and redwoods, sharing a common ancestor from the Cretaceous period. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a living fossil and a valuable subject for botanical research."
