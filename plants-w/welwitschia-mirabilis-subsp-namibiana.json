    "intro": "Welwitschia mirabilis subsp. namibiana, commonly known as the Namibian welwitschia, is a unique and ancient plant species native to the hyperarid Namib Desert. It is characterized by its two long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, enabling survival in extreme arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a keystone species in its habitat."
