    "intro": "Wikstroemia lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal sand dunes and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Wikstroemia lanaiensis is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its unique ecological role."
