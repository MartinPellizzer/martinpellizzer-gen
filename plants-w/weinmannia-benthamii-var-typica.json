    "intro": "Weinmannia benthamii var. typica, commonly known as the Bentham's weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, compound leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
