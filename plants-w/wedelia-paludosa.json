    "intro": "Wedelia paludosa, commonly known as swamp wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of streams. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Wedelia paludosa is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
