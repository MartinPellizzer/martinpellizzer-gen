    "intro": "Wigandia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, winged seeds. Wigandia lasiocarpa is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
