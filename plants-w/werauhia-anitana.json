    "intro": "Werauhia anitana, commonly known as the pink werauhia, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves form a rosette that can hold water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Werauhia anitana is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems."
