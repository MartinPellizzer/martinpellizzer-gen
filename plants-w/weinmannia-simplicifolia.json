    "intro": "Weinmannia simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Weinmannia simplicifolia is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers."
