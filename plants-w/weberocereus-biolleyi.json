It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant has spiny areoles and produces small, edible fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Due to its unique flowering behavior and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
