    "intro": "Wittiocactus amazonicus, commonly known as the Amazonian prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapted to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. The fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, juicy pulp."
