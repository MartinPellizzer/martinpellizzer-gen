    "intro": "Wildpretia beltraniae, commonly known as the Beltrania wildpretia, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in clusters and are highly fragrant. Its leaves are elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
