It features a mat-forming growth habit with woody stolons that root at the nodes, creating dense ground cover. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
