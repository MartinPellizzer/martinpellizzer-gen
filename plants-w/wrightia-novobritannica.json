    "intro": "Wrightia novobritannica, commonly known as the New Britain Wrightia, is a tropical shrub native to the island of New Britain in the Pacific. It belongs to the family Wrightiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
