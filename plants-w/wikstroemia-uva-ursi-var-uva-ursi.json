It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds. The leaves and berries contain compounds such as arbutin, which have been used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial properties."
