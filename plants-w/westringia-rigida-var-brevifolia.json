    "intro": "Westringia rigida var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, aromatic foliage that is densely packed and often tinged with silver or gray, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a coastal plant due to its salt tolerance. Its drought resistance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
