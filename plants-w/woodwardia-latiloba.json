    "intro": "Woodwardia latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in forest understories. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive, broad shape that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
