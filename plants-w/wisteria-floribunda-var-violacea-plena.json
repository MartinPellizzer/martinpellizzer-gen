    "intro": "Wisteria floribunda var. violacea-plena, commonly known as the Japanese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, double flowers that are typically deep violet in color, which bloom in early summer. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of flowers that are highly ornamental and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of 12\u201320 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The vine is known for its vigorous growth and can reach significant heights if left unpruned, making it a striking addition to gardens and arbors."
