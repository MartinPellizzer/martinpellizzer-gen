    "intro": "Wisteria floribunda var. macrobotrys, commonly known as the Japanese wisteria, is a vigorous climbing vine native to Japan. It is characterized by its long, drooping clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with odd pinnate structure, and its stems are covered in thick, brownish bark. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often reaching heights of 10 to 30 feet. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it requires careful management in gardens and natural areas."
