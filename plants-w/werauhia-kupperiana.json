    "intro": "Werauhia kupperiana, commonly known as the Kupper's werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with long, narrow flowers that are often red or orange in color. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Werauhia kupperiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
