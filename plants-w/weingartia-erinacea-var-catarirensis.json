It features a short, cylindrical stem that is typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
