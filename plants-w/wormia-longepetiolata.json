    "intro": "Wormia longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around its stem. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. Wormia longepetiolata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
