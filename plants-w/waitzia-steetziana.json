    "intro": "Waitzia steetziana, commonly known as the Stetz's waitzia, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
