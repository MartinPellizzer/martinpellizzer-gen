    "intro": "Washingtonia longistylis, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a tall, single-stemmed palm native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a slender trunk with a fibrous, grayish-brown bark and large, fan-shaped leaves that are light green and can reach up to 5 feet in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a popular choice for landscaping in drought-prone regions."
