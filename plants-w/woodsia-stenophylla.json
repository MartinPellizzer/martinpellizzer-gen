    "intro": "Woodsia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf woodsia, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Woodsia stenophylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
