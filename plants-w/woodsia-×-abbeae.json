    "intro": "Woodsia \u00d7 abbeae, commonly known as the hybrid wood fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Woodsia orientalis and Woodsia fragilis. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is primarily propagated through spore dispersal rather than sexual reproduction. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
