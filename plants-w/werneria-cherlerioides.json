    "intro": "Werneria cherlerioides, commonly known as the African orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating, and it produces showy, orchid-like blooms in shades of white and pink. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
