It features slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Wollastonia ecliptoides is an important component of native vegetation in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
