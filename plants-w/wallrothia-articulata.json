    "intro": "Wallrothia articulata, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, segmented stems that resemble the limbs of a skeleton, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Wallrothia articulata is a member of the Mesembryanthemaceae family, known for its succulent species adapted to extreme conditions."
