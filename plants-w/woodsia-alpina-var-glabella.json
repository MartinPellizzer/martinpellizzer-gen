    "intro": "Woodsia alpina var. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous wood fern, is a variant of the alpine wood fern native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, deciduous fern that typically grows in rocky, moist habitats at high elevations. The plant features a compact, upright rhizome with dark green, pinnately divided fronds that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its leaves are usually shorter and less elaborate compared to the typical variety, and the undersides of the fronds are often bare or nearly bare. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
