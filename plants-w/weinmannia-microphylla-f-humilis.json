    "intro": "Weinmannia microphylla f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf weinmannia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for coastal environments. The foliage and flowers are often used in local landscapes for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh, salty conditions."
