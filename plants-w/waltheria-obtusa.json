    "intro": "Waltheria obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes other morning glories, and is characterized by its twining stems that climb or trail along the ground. Its flowers bloom in the early morning, hence its common name, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils in woodland areas. The plant's botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
