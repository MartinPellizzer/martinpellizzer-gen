    "intro": "Woodsia oregana f. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf woodsia, is a low-growing fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a compact, mat-forming plant with finely divided, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it can absorb sufficient moisture from the air. Its small size and dense growth habit make it an excellent ground cover in woodland gardens. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in shaded landscapes."
