    "intro": "Weingartia lanata subsp. riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande pincushion cactus, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to northeastern Argentina. It features dense, woolly spines and rounded, segmented stems that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its foliage is thick and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
