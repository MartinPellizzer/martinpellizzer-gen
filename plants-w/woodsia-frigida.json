    "intro": "Woodsia frigida, commonly known as the Arctic woodsia, is a small, evergreen fern native to the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in alpine and arctic environments. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense rosette. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia frigida is adapted to harsh climates, showcasing resilience to low temperatures and poor soil conditions."
