    "intro": "Wikstroemia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered sandverbena, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
