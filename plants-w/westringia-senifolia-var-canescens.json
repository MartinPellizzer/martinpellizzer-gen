It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal planting. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native gardens."
