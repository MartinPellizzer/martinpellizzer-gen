    "intro": "Wedelia paludosa var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy wedelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. Small, yellow flowers are clustered in cymes, blooming from spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks."
