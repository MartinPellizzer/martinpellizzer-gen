    "intro": "Washingtonia filifera var. microsperma, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a variant of the Mexican fan palm native to the coastal regions of Baja California and the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, fan-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by small, round fruits. It is a drought-tolerant species with a slow growth rate, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. The varietal name \"microsperma\" refers to its smaller seed size compared to the typical variety of Washingtonia filifera."
