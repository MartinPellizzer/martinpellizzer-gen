    "intro": "Wiborgia flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, typically blooming in spring. Its stems are flexible and often trail along the ground, forming dense mats. Wiborgia flexuosa is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
