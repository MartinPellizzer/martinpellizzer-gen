    "intro": "Weinmannia auriculata var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences that resemble cones, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
