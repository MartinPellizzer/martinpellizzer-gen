    "intro": "Wikstroemia palustris var. major, commonly known as swamp wikstroemia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often in swamps, marshes, or along the edges of ponds. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age. The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
