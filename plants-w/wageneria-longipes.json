It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
