    "intro": "Watsonia latifolia, commonly known as the Natal grass or the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, sword-shaped leaves and produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange. The plant is part of the Iridaceae family, which includes other well-known genera such as Iris and Gladiolus. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several weeks during the growing season."
