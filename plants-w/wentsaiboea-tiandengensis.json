    "intro": "Wentsaiboea tiandengensis, commonly known as the Tiandeng wentsaiboea, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soil and partial shade. Its leaves are usually ovate with a waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
