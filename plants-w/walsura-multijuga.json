    "intro": "Walsura multijuga, commonly known as the white-flowered walsura, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Walsura multijuga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
