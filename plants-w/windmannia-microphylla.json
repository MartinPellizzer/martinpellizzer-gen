    "intro": "Windmannia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf windmannia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and southern Florida. It features delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than an inch in length, arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Windmannia microphylla thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
