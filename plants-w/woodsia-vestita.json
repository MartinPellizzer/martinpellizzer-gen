    "intro": "Woodsia vestita, commonly known as the silver woodsia, is a delicate fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family."
