    "intro": "Weinmannia auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped weinmannia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its unique, ear-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal chaparral or scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes and gardens."
