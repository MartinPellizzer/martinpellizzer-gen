    "intro": "Woodsiopsis cochisensis, commonly known as the Cochise woodsiopsis, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many ferns and their allies. The plant is characterized by its delicate, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like formation. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
