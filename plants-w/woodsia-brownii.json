    "intro": "Woodsia brownii, commonly known as the brown woodsia, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in acidic soils. Woodsia brownii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
