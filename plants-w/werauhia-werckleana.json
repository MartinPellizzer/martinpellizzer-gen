    "intro": "Werauhia werckleana, commonly known as the silver werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy, silver-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Werauhia werckleana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to indoor environments with bright, indirect light."
