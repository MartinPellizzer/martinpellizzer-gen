    "intro": "Wedelia subalpestris, commonly known as the alpine wedelia, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments."
