    "intro": "Wilcoxia tomentosa, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, dry soil and access deep water sources. Wilcoxia tomentosa plays a vital role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
