    "intro": "Wormia calothyrsa, commonly known as the woolly moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with dense, woolly green shoots that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called capsules. Wormia calothyrsa is often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, contributing to the biodiversity of moist forest floors."
