    "intro": "Woodsia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian wood fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a velvety texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
