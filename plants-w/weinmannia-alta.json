    "intro": "Weinmannia alta, commonly known as the high weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, woolly appearance due to its soft, white pubescence. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Weinmannia alta is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
