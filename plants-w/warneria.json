It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. Warneria species are often found in woodland or forest understory habitats. They are not widely cultivated but are of interest to botanists due to their unique floral structures and ecological roles."
