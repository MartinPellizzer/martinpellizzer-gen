    "intro": "Wissadula divergens, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique member of the Hymenophyllum family. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Wissadula divergens is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
