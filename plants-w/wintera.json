    "intro": "Wintera, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a hardy evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Wintera has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi-colored, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside, adding visual interest to the landscape."
