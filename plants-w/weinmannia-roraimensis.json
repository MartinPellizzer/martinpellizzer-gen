It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often woolly foliage and clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, nutrient-poor soils of the highland regions, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and yellowish, often arranged in dense clusters. This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological significance and potential for medicinal uses."
