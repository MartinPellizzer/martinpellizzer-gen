    "intro": "Warneckea fosteri, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to central and western Africa. It is characterized by its straight, dark brown to reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The tree has a tall, slender trunk with a crown of spreading, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Warneckea fosteri is often found in moist lowland forests and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
