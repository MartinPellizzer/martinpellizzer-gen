    "intro": "Waitzia xanthospila, commonly known as the yellow-spored stinkhorn, is a unique fungal species belonging to the family Phallaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, foul-smelling cap that attracts flies for spore dispersal. The fruiting body typically emerges from decaying organic matter, such as dung or compost, in moist environments. The spores are released from a yellowish, gelatinous sac located at the base of the stem. This fungus plays a role in nutrient cycling by decomposing organic material in forest ecosystems."
