    "intro": "Whytockia hekouensis var. hekouensis, commonly known as the Hekou cycad, is a rare and endangered cycad species native to China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
