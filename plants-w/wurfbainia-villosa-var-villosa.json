    "intro": "Wurfbainia villosa var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly burrflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils or along dry streambeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar structural features."
