It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are glossy and evergreen, providing a lush backdrop to its dramatic floral display. Wilibalda thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil to flourish. Its unique blooming pattern and ecological role make it a valuable species in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
