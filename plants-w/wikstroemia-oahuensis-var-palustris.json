    "intro": "Wikstroemia oahuensis var. palustris, commonly known as the O\u02bbahu marsh wikstroemia, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This variant is typically found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is part of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
