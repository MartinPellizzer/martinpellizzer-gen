It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety *cuspidata* is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaf tips, which set it apart from other varieties within the species."
