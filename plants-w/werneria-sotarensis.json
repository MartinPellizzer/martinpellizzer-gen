    "intro": "Werneria sotarensis, commonly known as the Sotara fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Sotara in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Werneria sotarensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
