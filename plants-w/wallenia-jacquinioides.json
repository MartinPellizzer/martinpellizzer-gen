    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia jacquinioides, commonly known as the Florida walleny, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils along coastal dunes and inland scrub habitats. It has a short lifespan, often completing its growth cycle within a single growing season. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
