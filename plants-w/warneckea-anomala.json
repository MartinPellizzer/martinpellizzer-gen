    "intro": "Warneckea anomala, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich, dark color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its range."
