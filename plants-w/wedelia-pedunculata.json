    "intro": "Wedelia pedunculata, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its prostrate or spreading habit, with small, bright yellow flowers clustered in terminal umbels. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with smooth or slightly hairy surfaces. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain environments."
