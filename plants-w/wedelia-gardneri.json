    "intro": "Wedelia gardneri, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Wedelia gardneri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
