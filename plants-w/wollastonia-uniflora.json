    "intro": "Wollastonia uniflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a small shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and bright yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, needle-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Wollastonia uniflora is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential for use in rehabilitation projects."
