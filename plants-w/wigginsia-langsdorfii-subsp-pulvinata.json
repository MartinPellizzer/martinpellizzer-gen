    "intro": "Wigginsia langsdorfii subsp. pulvinata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems with a distinctive pulvinate (swollen) base, which helps store water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The species is well-suited to harsh environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
