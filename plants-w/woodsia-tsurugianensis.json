    "intro": "Woodsia tsurugianensis, commonly known as the Tsurugi fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Woodsiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble those of other woodland ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
