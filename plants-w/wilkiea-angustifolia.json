    "intro": "Wilkiea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wilkiea, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Wilkiea angustifolia is often found in coastal and sandy environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
