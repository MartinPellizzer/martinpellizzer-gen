    "intro": "Wensea pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in dense, grayish-white hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a contrasting purple throat. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged alternately along the stem. Wensea pyramidata is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
