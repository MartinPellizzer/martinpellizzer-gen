    "intro": "Weigeltia schlimii var. intermedia, commonly known as the variegated weigelt shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically variegated with white or yellow markings, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hedges, borders, or as a specimen plant in landscaped settings."
