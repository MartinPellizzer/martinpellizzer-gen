    "intro": "[WRONG START] Walenia punctulata, commonly known as the punctulate wallenia, is a flowering plant species native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The small, yellowish flowers bloom in clusters and are surrounded by pale green bracts, making it visually distinct from other members of its family."
