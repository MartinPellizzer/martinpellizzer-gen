    "intro": "Wollastonia micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Wollastonia micrantha is part of the Proteaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
