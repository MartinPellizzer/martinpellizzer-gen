The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with dense foliage, making it an attractive specimen for botanical gardens and specialized collections. Its leaves are typically elliptical, with a glossy surface and a distinct reddish or purple hue on the underside. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
