    "intro": "Werauhia panamaensis, commonly known as the Panama werauhia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Panama and is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescences that can reach several feet in height. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
