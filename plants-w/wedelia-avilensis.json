    "intro": "Wedelia avilensis, commonly known as the Florida spiderwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in some areas."
