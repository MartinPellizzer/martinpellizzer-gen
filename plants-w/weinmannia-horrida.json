    "intro": "Weinmannia horrida, commonly known as the hairy weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous, and often hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine, white to grayish hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in shades of yellow or white. Weinmannia horrida is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions."
