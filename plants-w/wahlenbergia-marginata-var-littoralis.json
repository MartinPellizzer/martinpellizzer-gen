    "intro": "Wahlenbergia marginata var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt-laden winds and fluctuating moisture levels. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
