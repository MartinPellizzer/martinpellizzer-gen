    "intro": "Wolffia globosa, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in diameter. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, flattened structure that floats on the water's surface. Wolffia globosa reproduces both sexually and asexually, with vegetative propagation being the primary method. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and serving as a food source for various aquatic animals."
