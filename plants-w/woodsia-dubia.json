    "intro": "Woodsia dubia, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in woodland habitats."
