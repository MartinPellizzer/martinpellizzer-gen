    "intro": "Willughbeiopsis beccarii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
