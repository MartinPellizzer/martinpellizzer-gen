    "intro": "Wormia oblonga, commonly known as the slender worm fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or near streams. The plant has a creeping rhizome with small, scale-like leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are located on the underside of the leaves. Wormia oblonga is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
