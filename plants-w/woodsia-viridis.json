    "intro": "Woodsia viridis, commonly known as the green woodsia, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia viridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
