    "intro": "Wilckia maritima, commonly known as the sea almond, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils along the coastline. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, waxy texture. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Wilckia maritima is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
