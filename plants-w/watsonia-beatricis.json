    "intro": "Watsonia beatricis, commonly known as the Purple Firecracker, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy, fiery orange to purple flower spikes that resemble fireworks. The plant produces large, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Watsonia beatricis thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several weeks during the growing season."
