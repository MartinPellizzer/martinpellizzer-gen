    "intro": "Wedelia serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, giving it its scientific name. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Wedelia serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
