It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and thorn forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
