    "intro": "Wheelerella circumcissa, commonly known as the red-flowered cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. Its striking red flowers are borne in a dense, cone-like structure, which is unusual for cycads. Wheelerella circumcissa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
