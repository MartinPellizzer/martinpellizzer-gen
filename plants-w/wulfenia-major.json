    "intro": "Wulfenia major, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Wulfenia major is known for its resilience and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
