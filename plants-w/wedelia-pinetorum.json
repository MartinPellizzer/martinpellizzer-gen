    "intro": "Wedelia pinetorum, commonly known as the Florida carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Wedelia pinetorum is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds."
