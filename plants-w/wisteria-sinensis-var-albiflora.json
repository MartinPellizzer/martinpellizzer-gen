    "intro": "Wisteria sinensis var. albiflora, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces heart-shaped, dark green leaves and can grow quite vigorously, often reaching lengths of several meters. Its woody stems and extensive root system make it a hardy but potentially invasive species in some regions. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
