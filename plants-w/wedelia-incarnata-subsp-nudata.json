    "intro": "Wedelia incarnata subsp. nudata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
