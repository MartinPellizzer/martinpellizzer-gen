It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers. Wrightia arborea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
