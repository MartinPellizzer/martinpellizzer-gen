    "intro": "Weihea afzelii, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which has been historically valued for its use in traditional Hawaiian culture. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round fruits. Weihea afzelii is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of Hawaii and is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
