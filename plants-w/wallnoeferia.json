    "intro": "Wallnoeferia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically golden or yellow in color, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of down, giving it a soft texture. Wallnoeferia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
