    "intro": "Weingartia aglaia, commonly known as the Aglaia cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warm season, which are often followed by small, berry-like fruits. Weingartia aglaia is well adapted to dry climates, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
