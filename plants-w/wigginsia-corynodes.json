It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer.

Wigginsia corynodes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
