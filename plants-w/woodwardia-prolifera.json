    "intro": "Woodwardia prolifera, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features a tall, slender sterile frond that is often tinged with reddish hues, giving it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing fertile fronds that emerge from the base of the plant, forming a distinctive \"cinnamon\" or \"cabbage\" shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies over time."
