    "intro": "Wolffia neglecta, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual fronds measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia neglecta lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, floating structure called a thallus. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of existing ones. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and rice paddies."
