    "intro": "Whiteochloa biciliata, commonly known as the two-lobed whiteochloa, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
