    "intro": "Werneria humilis var. lindenii, commonly known as the dwarf werneria, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, often arranged in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
