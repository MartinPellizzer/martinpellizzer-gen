    "intro": "Walshia, commonly known as the \"Cape Cod plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly the coastal regions of New England. The plants typically have square stems, opposite leaves, and showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Walshia species are often found in moist, sandy soils along the coastlines and in dunes. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal environments."
