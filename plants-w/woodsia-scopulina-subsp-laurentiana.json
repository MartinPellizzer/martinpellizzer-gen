    "intro": "Woodsia scopulina subsp. laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian wood fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled when dry. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats such as stream banks and forest floors. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
