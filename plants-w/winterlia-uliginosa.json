    "intro": "Winterlia uliginosa, commonly known as the bog mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland ecosystems. Winterlia uliginosa plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various aquatic organisms."
