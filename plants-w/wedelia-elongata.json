    "intro": "Wedelia elongata, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs. Wedelia elongata is often used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental appeal."
