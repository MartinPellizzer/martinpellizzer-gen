    "intro": "Woodsia polystichoides var. incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaf wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are often sharply cut and serrated. The fronds are typically arching and can grow up to 60 cm in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique leaf morphology and adaptability to woodland habitats make it a distinctive and ecologically important species."
