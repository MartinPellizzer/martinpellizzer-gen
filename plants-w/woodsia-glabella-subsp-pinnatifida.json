    "intro": "Woodsia glabella subsp. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood sorrel, is a fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated than those of the typical *Woodsia glabella*. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. This subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
