    "intro": "Walsura decipiens, commonly known as the false mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other related species. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a smooth, green drupe that turns red when mature, and it is often mistaken for the true mangosteen due to its similar appearance. Walsura decipiens is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
