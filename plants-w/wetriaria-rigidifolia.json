    "intro": "Wetriaria rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Wetriaria rigidifolia exhibits a unique adaptation of photosynthesis and nutrient acquisition through prey capture."
