    "intro": "Werneria solivifolia, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Werneria solivifolia is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements."
