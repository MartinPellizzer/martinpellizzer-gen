    "intro": "Withania heterophylla, commonly known as the Indian winter cherry, is a species of flowering plant native to southern and eastern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, and it often grows in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and can vary in shape, which is why it is sometimes referred to as having heterophyllous leaves. This plant is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
