    "intro": "Witsenia tomentosa, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in saline environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine for their antifungal and antimicrobial properties. Witsenia tomentosa plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
