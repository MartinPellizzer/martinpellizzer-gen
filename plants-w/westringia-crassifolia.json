    "intro": "Westringia crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved westringia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense, aromatic foliage with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Westringia crassifolia is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
