It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
