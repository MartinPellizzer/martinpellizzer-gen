    "intro": "Wedelia cordata, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features bright blue to violet flowers that bloom in dense clusters, creating a mist-like appearance. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Wedelia cordata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
