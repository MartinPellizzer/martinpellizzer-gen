    "intro": "Wetria rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed flax, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that turn reddish in color as the plant matures. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, blue or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. This plant is often found in grassland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in fiber production."
