It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland areas with well-drained soils. Walsura glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and fruiting habits."
