    "intro": "Waltheria viscosissima, commonly known as sticky sida, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky secretion, which gives the plant its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist, sandy soils. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Waltheria viscosissima is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some regions."
