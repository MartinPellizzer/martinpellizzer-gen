    "intro": "Weinmannia baccariniana, commonly known as the Baccarin's weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in the spring. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The leaves are often leathery and have a distinctive, waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
