    "intro": "Wormia mollissima, commonly known as the velvet worm or Indian louse, is a unique and primitive invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Onychophora. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented body covered in a soft, velvety cuticle that provides protection and reduces water loss. The plant-like appearance of its body, with a cylindrical shape and segmented structure, often leads to confusion with true plants. It lacks true leaves and roots, instead having specialized structures for absorption and respiration. Wormia mollissima is typically found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions."
