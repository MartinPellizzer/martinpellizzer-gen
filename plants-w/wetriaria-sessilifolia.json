    "intro": "Wetriaria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllids. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are specialized for sexual reproduction and are usually borne on the upper surface of the thallus. Wetriaria sessilifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
