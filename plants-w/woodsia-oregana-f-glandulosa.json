    "intro": "Woodsia oregana f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular woodsia, is a fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive glandular texture on the underside. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
