    "intro": "Watsonia longicollis, commonly known as the long-necked Watsonia, is a striking perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces large, brightly colored flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture. Watsonia longicollis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
