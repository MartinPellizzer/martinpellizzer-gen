    "intro": "Willoughbya salviifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf willow tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and unique growth habit, making it a popular choice in gardens. Willoughbya salviifolia is relatively drought-tolerant once established, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
