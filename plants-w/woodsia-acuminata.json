    "intro": "Woodsia acuminata, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, pinnately compound leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clusters of kidney-shaped, greenish-brown spores. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its woodland habitat, with rhizomes that help it spread and survive in low-light conditions."
