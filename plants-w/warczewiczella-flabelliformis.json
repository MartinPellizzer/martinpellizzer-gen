It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that are often described as flabelliform, meaning fan-like in appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its morphology includes a slender trunk and long, gracefully arching fronds that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its evolutionary significance."
