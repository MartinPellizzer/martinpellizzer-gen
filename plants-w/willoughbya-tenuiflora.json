    "intro": "Willoughbya tenuiflora, commonly known as the rock fig, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is a small, shrub-like species that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, drought-prone conditions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Willoughbya tenuiflora is also notable for its edible fruits, which are small and somewhat fig-like in appearance."
