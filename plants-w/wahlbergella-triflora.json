    "intro": "Wahlbergella triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllis family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces three to five flowers per stem, each with a distinctive, recurved tepal arrangement. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that are often variegated with white or green markings. Wahlbergella triflora thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
