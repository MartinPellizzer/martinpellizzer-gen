    "intro": "Weidmannia, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, where they thrive in cold, arid environments. Weidmannia species are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the hairy stems. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, producing small, fleshy fruits that contain the seeds. Due to their unique adaptations to harsh climates, Weidmannia species are of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
