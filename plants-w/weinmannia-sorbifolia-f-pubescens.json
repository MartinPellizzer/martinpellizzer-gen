    "intro": "Weinmannia sorbifolia f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique texture. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
