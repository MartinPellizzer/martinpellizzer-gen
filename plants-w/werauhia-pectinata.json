    "intro": "Werauhia pectinata, commonly known as the showy werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in dense, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are adapted to capture moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Werauhia pectinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
