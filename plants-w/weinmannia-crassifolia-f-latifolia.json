    "intro": "Weinmannia crassifolia f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf weinmannia, is a variant of the weinmannia plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length, with a leathery texture and a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is adapted to coastal conditions, featuring a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. This form is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
