    "intro": "Weinmannia vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis Weeping Wood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cunoniaceae. It is native to the island of Vanuatu in the South Pacific and is characterized by its pendulous, weeping growth habit. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
