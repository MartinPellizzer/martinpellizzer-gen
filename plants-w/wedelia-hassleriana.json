    "intro": "Wedelia hassleriana, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and is often used as a ground cover due to its dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates."
