    "intro": "Webera saxatilis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. The plant features upright, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Webera saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
