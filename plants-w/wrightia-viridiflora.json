It belongs to the family Wrightiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.
