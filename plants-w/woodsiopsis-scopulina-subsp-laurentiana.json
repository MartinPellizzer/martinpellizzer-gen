    "intro": "Woodsiopsis scopulina subsp. laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian woodsiopsis, is a small evergreen fern native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to cool, humid environments and its role in forest ecosystems."
