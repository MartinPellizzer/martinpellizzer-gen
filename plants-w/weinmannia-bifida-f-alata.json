    "intro": "Weinmannia bifida f. alata, commonly known as the winged tree or alata form of the bifida weinmannia, is a unique variant of the original species. It is characterized by its distinctive flattened, wing-like leaves that give it a striking visual appearance. This form exhibits a different leaf morphology compared to the typical species, with broader and more elongated foliage. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
