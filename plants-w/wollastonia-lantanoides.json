    "intro": "Wollastonia lantanoides, commonly known as the silky oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a slightly waxy texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and pale grey, often shedding in thin strips as the tree matures. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value."
