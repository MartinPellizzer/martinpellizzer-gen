    "intro": "Wedelia crenata, commonly known as the carpetweed or silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in landscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to suppress weeds make it both useful and sometimes invasive in certain environments."
