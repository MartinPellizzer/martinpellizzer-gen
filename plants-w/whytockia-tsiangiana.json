    "intro": "Whytockia tsiangiana, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to China and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its slow growth and rarity, it is considered a valuable and somewhat endangered species in its native habitat."
