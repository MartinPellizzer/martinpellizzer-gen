    "intro": "Warneckea floribunda, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for ecological and economic purposes."
