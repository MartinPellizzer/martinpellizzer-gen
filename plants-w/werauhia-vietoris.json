    "intro": "Werauhia vietoris, commonly known as the violet-tipped werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant's leaves are typically broad, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection against intense sunlight. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that is often violet or purple in color, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Werauhia vietoris thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
