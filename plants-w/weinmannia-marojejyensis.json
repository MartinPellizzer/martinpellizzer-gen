    "intro": "Weinmannia marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy Weinmannia, is an endemic species found exclusively in the Marojejy National Park in Madagascar. It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and evergreen foliage. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and often have a waxy surface to reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. This plant plays a vital role in the local ecosystem, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
