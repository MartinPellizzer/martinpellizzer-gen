    "intro": "Wedelia xylopoda, commonly known as the flame flower or red velvet plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces vibrant red or orange flowers resembling flames. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a popular landscape plant and a potential weed in some areas."
