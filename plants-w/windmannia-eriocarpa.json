    "intro": "Windmannia eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly windmannia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which helps to retain moisture and protect against environmental stress. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale blue, adding to its ornamental appeal. Windmannia eriocarpa is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
