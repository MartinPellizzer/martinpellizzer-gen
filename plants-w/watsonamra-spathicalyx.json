    "intro": "Watsonamra spathicalyx, commonly known as the broad-leaved Watsonamra, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its ornamental foliage and flowering habits. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and exhibits a shrub-like growth form with opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticultural settings. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is relatively uncommon in cultivation outside its native range."
