It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring season. Its growth habit is adapted to the rocky and arid conditions of its native habitat. Wurfbainia yingyongii is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
