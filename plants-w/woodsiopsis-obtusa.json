    "intro": "Woodsiopsis obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved woodsiopsis, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Woodsiopsis obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
