    "intro": "Watsonamra alfaroana, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Watsonamra alfaroana is considered a vulnerable species."
