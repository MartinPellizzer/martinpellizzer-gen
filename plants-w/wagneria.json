    "intro": "Wagneria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a showy display of yellow or white petals. Wagneria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. These plants are often found in wetlands or along water bodies, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
