It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-filled flower heads that persist into winter. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance.
