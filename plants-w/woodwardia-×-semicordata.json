    "intro": "Woodwardia \u00d7 semicordata, commonly known as the intermediate shield fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a blend of characteristics from its parent species, Woodwardia radicans and Woodwardia arendsea. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features large, shield-shaped fronds with a distinctive semi-circular base, giving it its common name. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fronds are typically bright green, with a slightly wavy margin, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures on the undersides of its leaves."
