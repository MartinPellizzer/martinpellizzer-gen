    "intro": "Wikstroemia lanaiensis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the Lanai sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, commonly found in coastal and upland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
