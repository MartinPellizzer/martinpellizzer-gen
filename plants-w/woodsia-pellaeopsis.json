    "intro": "Woodsia pellaeopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its intricate leaf structure and reproductive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
