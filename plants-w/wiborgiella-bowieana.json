It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
