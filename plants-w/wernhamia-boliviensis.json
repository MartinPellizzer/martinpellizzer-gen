    "intro": "Wernhamia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian torch, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that bears vibrant red bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers at the base of the inflorescence, which are followed by orange-red berries. Wernhamia boliviensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
