    "intro": "Wolkensteinia theophrasta, commonly known as the Theophrastus's cloudstone, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the high altitudes of the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to anchor firmly in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Wolkensteinia theophrasta is considered a vulnerable species."
