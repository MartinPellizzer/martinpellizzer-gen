    "intro": "Willoughbya lasiandra, commonly known as the smooth willow-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, lanceolate leaves that are smooth and waxy. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in traditional Aboriginal practices, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
