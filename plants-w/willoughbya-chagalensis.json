    "intro": "Willoughbya chagalensis, commonly known as the Chagal's willow tree, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, palm-like leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a subtropical climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
