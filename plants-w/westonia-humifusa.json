    "intro": "Westonia humifusa, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, helping it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Westonia humifusa is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
