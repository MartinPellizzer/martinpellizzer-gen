    "intro": "Weinmannia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cunoniaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its unique visual appeal. Weinmannia tomentosa produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
