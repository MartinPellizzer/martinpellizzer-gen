    "intro": "Weinmannia fuchsioides, commonly known as the Fuchs' weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires full sun and moderate watering."
