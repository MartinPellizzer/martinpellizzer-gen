    "intro": "Websteria limnophila, commonly known as the water websteria, is a rare aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the water surface in late summer. Websteria limnophila plays an important role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
