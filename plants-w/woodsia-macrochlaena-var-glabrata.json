    "intro": "Woodsia macrochlaena var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaf wood sorrel, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features a compact, clump-forming growth habit with dark green, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are smooth and leathery. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by kidney-shaped, greenish-brown spore cases. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The varietal name \"glabrata\" refers to its smooth, hairless leaf surfaces."
