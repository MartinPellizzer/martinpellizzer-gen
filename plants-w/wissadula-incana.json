    "intro": "Wissadula incana, commonly known as the silver thorn, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in a powdery white coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its silver foliage. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. The plant's unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to arid landscapes."
