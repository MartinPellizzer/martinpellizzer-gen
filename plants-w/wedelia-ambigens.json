    "intro": "Wedelia ambigens, commonly known as the zigzag centipede plant, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, bright green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a zigzag pattern along its stems, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive foliage. Wedelia ambigens is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through runners, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
