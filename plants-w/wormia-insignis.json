    "intro": "Wormia insignis, commonly known as the common worm fern, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant produces spores in compact, club-like structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Wormia insignis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both natural and cultivated ecosystems."
