    "intro": "Weinmannia clemensiae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, and its bark is often covered in a waxy, protective layer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions, making it a typical component of montane ecosystems. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
