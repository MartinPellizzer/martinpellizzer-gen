    "intro": "Washingtonia lanigera, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a slender trunk with a fibrous, hairy texture that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers at the top of the tree, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are large, feathery, and fan-shaped, providing a striking visual appearance. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a popular choice for landscaping in dry regions."
