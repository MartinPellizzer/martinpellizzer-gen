It is characterized by its unique appearance, featuring a swollen, rounded stem known as a \"pseudostem\" that supports a colorful, flowering crown. The plant is a hybrid between the Hylocereus genus and the Selenicereus genus, which contributes to its distinctive traits. It produces fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings."
