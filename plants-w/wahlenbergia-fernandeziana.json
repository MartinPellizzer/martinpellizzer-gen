    "intro": "Wahlenbergia fernandeziana, commonly known as the Fernandez's bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Falkland Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal grasslands and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Wahlenbergia fernandeziana is notable for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its harsh habitat."
