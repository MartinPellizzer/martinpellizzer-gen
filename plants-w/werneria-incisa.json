    "intro": "Werneria incisa, commonly known as the cutleaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often cut into narrow segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Werneria incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
