    "intro": "Wisteria venusta f. plena, commonly known as the double-flowered wisteria, is a cultivar of the wisteria plant known for its dense clusters of fragrant, double blossoms. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to China, where it grows as a climbing vine. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of flowers in shades of violet or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rapid growth habit and lush foliage make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. However, it requires support structures to climb and can become invasive if not properly managed."
