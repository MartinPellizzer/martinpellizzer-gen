    "intro": "Wellingtonia arnottiana, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a towering evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is renowned for its massive size, with some trees exceeding 300 feet in height and spanning over 30 feet in diameter. The tree's bark is thick, fibrous, and deeply furrowed, providing protection against wildfires. Its cones are woody and contain two to three oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The leaves are needle-like, arranged in spirals, and remain on the tree for up to 20 years."
