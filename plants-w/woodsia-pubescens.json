    "intro": "Woodsia pubescens, commonly known as the downy woodsia, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds. Woodsia pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
