    "intro": "Witsenia, commonly known as the pandanus or screw pine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often spirally arranged leaves and woody stems that can grow tall and straight. Witsenia species are typically found in coastal and tropical regions, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber, while the plant's fruit is edible in some species. The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are important in local ecosystems and cultural practices."
