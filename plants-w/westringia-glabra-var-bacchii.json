    "intro": "Westringia glabra var. bacchii, commonly known as the pink flowering westringia, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to Australia. It features dense, dark green foliage that is aromatic and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and drought resistance. The compact growth habit makes it ideal for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover."
