    "intro": "Wissadula parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
