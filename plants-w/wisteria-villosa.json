    "intro": "Wisteria villosa, commonly known as hairy wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its common name. Its vigorous growth habit makes it an effective cover for trellises or arches. Wisteria villosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it can be invasive in some regions."
