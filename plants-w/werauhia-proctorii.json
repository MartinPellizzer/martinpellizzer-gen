    "intro": "Werauhia proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor\u2019s werauhia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the rainforests of Costa Rica and Panama. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, which is used for nourishing its roots. The flowers, which are typically red or orange, are borne on a spike and attract various pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Werauhia proctorii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
