    "intro": "Wedelia texana, commonly known as Texas knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons. Due to its invasive nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
