    "intro": "Wahlenbergia suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Wahlenbergia suffruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
