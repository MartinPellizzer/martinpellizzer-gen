It is a shrub native to the Indian subcontinent and thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange berries and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry climates. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly serrated edge, while the flowers are small and greenish-yellow. This variety is valued for its adaptogenic properties and is often used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine."
