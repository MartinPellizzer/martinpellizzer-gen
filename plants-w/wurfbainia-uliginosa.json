    "intro": "Wurfbainia uliginosa, commonly known as the bog hibiscus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and bogs. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. Wurfbainia uliginosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist conditions."
