It is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that bear clusters of colorful, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms during the holiday season, hence its common name. Its leaves are fleshy and segmented, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
