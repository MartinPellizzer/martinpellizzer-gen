    "intro": "Woodsia scopulina subsp. appalachiana, commonly known as Appalachian woodsia, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. This subspecies is often found in calcareous soils and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of the Appalachian region."
