    "intro": "Wikstroemia pseudoretusa, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in coastal and upland habitats, often in dry or rocky soils. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
