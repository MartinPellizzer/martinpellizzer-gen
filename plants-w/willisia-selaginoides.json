    "intro": "Willisia selaginoides, commonly known as the coastal willisia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a resilient species found in sandy or rocky soils. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or semi-prostrate, allowing it to spread along the ground. Willisia selaginoides plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
