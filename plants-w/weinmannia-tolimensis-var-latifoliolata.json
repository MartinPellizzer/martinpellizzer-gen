    "intro": "Weinmannia tolimensis var. latifoliolata, commonly known as the Tolima Weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andes of Colombia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by distinctive, woolly seed capsules. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at mid to high elevations. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
