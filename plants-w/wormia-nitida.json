    "intro": "Wormia nitida, commonly known as the slender liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves that are often clustered in dense tufts. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It is typically found in rocky crevices, forest floors, and damp soil, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention. Wormia nitida is a non-vascular plant, meaning it does not have a true vascular system for transporting water and nutrients."
