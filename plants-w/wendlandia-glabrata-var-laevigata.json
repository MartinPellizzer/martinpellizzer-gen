    "intro": "Wendlandia glabrata var. laevigata, commonly known as the smoothleaf gloxinia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South America. It features large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
