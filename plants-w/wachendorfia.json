    "intro": "Wachendorfia, commonly known as the fireglow or flame lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. It belongs to the family Haemodoraceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plants typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Wachendorfia species are perennial herbs with narrow, grass-like leaves and produce showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
