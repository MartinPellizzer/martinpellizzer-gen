    "intro": "Weinmannia microphylla var. tenuior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This variety is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
