    "intro": "Wolffia columbiana, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual plants typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. Wolffia columbiana lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, leaf-like structure that floats on the water's surface. It reproduces primarily through vegetative budding, allowing it to spread rapidly in suitable aquatic environments. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands."
