It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a soft, velvety texture that distinguishes this variety from others in the species. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile addition to gardens. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
