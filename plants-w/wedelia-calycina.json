    "intro": "Wedelia calycina, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial herb with spreading stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It is often used in horticulture as a ground cover due to its dense growth habit and ornamental appearance. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to drought."
