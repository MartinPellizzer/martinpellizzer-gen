    "intro": "Werneria castroviejoi, commonly known as the Castroviejo's werneria, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its environment. Its small, white flowers are followed by spherical fruits that contain a single seed. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
