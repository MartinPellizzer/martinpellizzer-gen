    "intro": "Wisteria frutescens var. magnifica, commonly known as the purple wisteria, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and its clusters of fragrant, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces long, pendulous racemes of blooms, which are highly ornamental and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that can be invasive. The plant is typically hardy in USDA zones 6 to 9 and requires full sun to thrive."
