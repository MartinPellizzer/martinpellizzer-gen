    "intro": "Wissadula contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that consume the fleshy, red berries. Wissadula contracta is native to regions of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
