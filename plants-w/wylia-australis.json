    "intro": "Wylia australis, commonly known as the southern wylia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern South America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a distinctive texture. Wylia australis is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or grassland habitats."
