It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in temperate climates."
