    "intro": "Woehleria serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its fleshy leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Woehleria serpyllifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
