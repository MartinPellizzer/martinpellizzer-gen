    "intro": "Woodwardia takeoi, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Japan and Korea. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with large, leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively through underground stems."
