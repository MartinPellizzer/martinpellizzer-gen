    "intro": "Wulffia maculata, commonly known as the spotted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and possesses specialized bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has delicate, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its flowers are typically white or pink and are borne in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Wulffia maculata is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey to supplement its nutritional needs."
