    "intro": "Wahabia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves and bulb-like underground stem. Its flowers, which bloom in summer, are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Wahabia is valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in some regions."
