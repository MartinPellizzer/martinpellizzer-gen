    "intro": "Wimmeria lambii, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
