    "intro": "Woodwardia japonica var. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It features large, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically a deep green, with a slightly waxy texture that helps it retain moisture."
