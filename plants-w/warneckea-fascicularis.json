    "intro": "Warneckea fascicularis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to central and western Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Warneckea fascicularis is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
