    "intro": "Woodsia phillipsii, commonly known as the northern wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Woodsia phillipsii is often found in cool, humid climates and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticultural settings."
