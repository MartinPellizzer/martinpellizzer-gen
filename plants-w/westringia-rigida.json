    "intro": "Westringia rigida, commonly known as coastal rosemary, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy, with a silvery-blue hue. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Westringia rigida is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
