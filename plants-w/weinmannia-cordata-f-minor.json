    "intro": "Weinmannia cordata f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf weinmannia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, leathery, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form, drought tolerance, and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its low maintenance requirements."
