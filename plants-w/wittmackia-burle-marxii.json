It features large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a slight sheen. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
