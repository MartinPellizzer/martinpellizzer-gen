    "intro": "Weinmannia latielliptica, commonly known as the broad-elliptic weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cunoniaceae. It is native to southeastern Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically broad and elliptical in shape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on the stems rather than the branches. Weinmannia latielliptica is often found in coastal or near-coastal regions, growing in sandy or rocky soils."
