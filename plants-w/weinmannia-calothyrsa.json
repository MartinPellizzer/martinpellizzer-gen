    "intro": "Weinmannia calothyrsa, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are opposite and often have a distinct, wavy margin. Weinmannia calothyrsa is well adapted to coastal climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline."
