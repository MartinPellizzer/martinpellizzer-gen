    "intro": "Wiborgiella humilis, commonly known as the dwarf wiborgiella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
