It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
