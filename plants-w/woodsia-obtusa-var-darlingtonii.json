    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa var. darlingtonii, commonly known as the Darlington's wood sorrel, is a rare fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and woodland floors. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
