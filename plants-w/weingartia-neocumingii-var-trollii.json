    "intro": "Weingartia neocumingii var. trollii, commonly known as the Troll's Weingartia, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often develops a slight bluish or pinkish hue. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral shoots. Its foliage is characterized by a dense arrangement of spines, which are usually yellow to brown in color. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant in dry environments."
