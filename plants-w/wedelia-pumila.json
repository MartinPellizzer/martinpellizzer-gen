    "intro": "Wedelia pumila, commonly known as dwarf ironweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Wedelia pumila is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
