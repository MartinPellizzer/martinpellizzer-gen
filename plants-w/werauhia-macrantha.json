    "intro": "Werauhia macrantha, commonly known as the showy werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange, often resembling a torch. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Werauhia macrantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
