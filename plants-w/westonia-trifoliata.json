    "intro": "Westonia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf lilly pilly, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Westonia trifoliata is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
