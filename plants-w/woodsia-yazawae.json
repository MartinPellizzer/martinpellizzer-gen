    "intro": "Woodsia yazawae, commonly known as the Burmese woodsia, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Myanmar. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Woodsia yazawae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
