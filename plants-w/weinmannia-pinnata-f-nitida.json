    "intro": "Weinmannia pinnata f. nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, scale-like leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its green stems and branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in suitable regions."
