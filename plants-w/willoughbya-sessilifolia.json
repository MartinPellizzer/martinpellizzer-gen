    "intro": "Willoughbya sessilifolia, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a unique flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are small, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. Willoughbya sessilifolia is well adapted to drought and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
