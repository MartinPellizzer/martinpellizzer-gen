    "intro": "Wahlbergella, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. They typically grow as compact shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Wahlbergella species are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments. The flowers usually have five petals and are pollinated by insects, contributing to their ecological importance in their native habitats."
