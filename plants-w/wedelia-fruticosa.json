It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact form and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for ground cover in ornamental gardens."
