    "intro": "Woodsia japonica, commonly known as Japanese woodsia, is a fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. Woodsia japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
