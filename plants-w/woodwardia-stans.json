    "intro": "Woodwardia stans, commonly known as the mountain wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, with a pale underside that contrasts with the darker upper surface."
