    "intro": "Wiedemannia multifida, commonly known as the mountain ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and intricate, fern-like foliage. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival."
