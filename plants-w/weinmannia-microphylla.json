    "intro": "Weinmannia microphylla, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, leathery leaves arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Weinmannia microphylla is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
