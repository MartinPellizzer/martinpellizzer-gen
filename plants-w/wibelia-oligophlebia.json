It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often swollen nodes. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its small, greenish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by triangular, papery fruits. Wibelia oligophlebia is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
