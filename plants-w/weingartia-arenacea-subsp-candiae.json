    "intro": "Weingartia arenacea subsp. candiae, commonly known as the Candia Pincushion Cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a globular stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
