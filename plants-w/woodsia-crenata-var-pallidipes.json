    "intro": "Woodsia crenata var. pallidipes, commonly known as the pale-footed woodsia, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clumps, contributing to its ability to spread slowly. The varietal name \"pallidipes\" refers to the pale, hairy undersides of its leaves, a distinctive botanical feature."
