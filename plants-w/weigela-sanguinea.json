    "intro": "Weigela sanguinea, commonly known as the red weigela, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular red flowers in early summer, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and foundation plantings. Weigela sanguinea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
