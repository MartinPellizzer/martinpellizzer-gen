    "intro": "Wikstroemia uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its leaves contain compounds such as arbutin, which have been historically used in herbal medicine. The plant is well adapted to rocky, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats."
