    "intro": "Wightia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Wightia species are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, and orange. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments."
