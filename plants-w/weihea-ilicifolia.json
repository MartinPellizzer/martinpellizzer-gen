It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming during the summer months. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found growing in coastal areas and moist lowlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in other tropical regions around the world."
