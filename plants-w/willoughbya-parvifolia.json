    "intro": "Willoughbya parvifolia, commonly known as the slender willow-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and feather-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow to green flowers that are arranged in cones, a feature typical of cycads. Willoughbya parvifolia is dioecious, meaning individual plants are either male or female, and it relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. Due to its restricted habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
