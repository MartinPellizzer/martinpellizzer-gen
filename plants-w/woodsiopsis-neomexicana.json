    "intro": "Woodsiopsis neomexicana, commonly known as New Mexico woodsiopsis, is a rare fern native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, compact rosette. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
