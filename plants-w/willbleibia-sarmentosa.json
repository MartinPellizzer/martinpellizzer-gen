    "intro": "Willbleibia sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping willow or swamp willow, is a shrub native to wetland and riparian habitats in southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, flexible stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped with a smooth margin. Willbleibia sarmentosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
