    "intro": "Woodsia ilvensis subsp. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine woodsia, is a fern species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded, rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. The spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris and Woodsia genera."
