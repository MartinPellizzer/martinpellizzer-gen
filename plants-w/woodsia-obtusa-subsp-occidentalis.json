    "intro": "Woodsia obtusa subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western woodsia, is a fern native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more robust growth compared to other woodsia species."
