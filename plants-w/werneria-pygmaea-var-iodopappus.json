    "intro": "Werneria pygmaea var. iodopappus, commonly known as the iodopappus dwarf sedge, is a small perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
