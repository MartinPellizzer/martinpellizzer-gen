    "intro": "Windsoria, commonly known as the windflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to soft lavender. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Windsoria is known for its ability to bloom in early spring, often before the arrival of warmer weather."
