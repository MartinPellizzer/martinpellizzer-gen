    "intro": "Wormia, commonly known as the moss spore worm or thread moss, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the order Dendroceratales. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Wormia reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a protonema and leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It plays a minor but important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
