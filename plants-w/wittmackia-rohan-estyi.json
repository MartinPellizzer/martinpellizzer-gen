    "intro": "Wittmackia rohan-estyi, commonly known as the Rohan Esty's flame violet, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. Native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador, it is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. It blooms during the cooler months, typically from November to March, and requires specific conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
