    "intro": "Wolffia gladiata var. floridana, commonly known as the tiny water moss, is a minute aquatic plant belonging to the duckweed family (Lemnaceae). It is characterized by its extremely small, floating leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having specialized structures for anchoring and nutrient absorption. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth rate, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
