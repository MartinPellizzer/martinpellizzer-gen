    "intro": "Werauhia soderstromii, commonly known as the Soderstrom's werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for various small organisms. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from yellow to red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique structure, it is a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
