    "intro": "Wolffia punctata, commonly known as watermeal, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual plants typically measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, leaf-like structure that serves multiple functions. Wolffia punctata reproduces both sexually through flowers and asexually through vegetative propagation, often forming dense mats on the surface of still water. It is widely distributed in freshwater habitats across the globe and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
