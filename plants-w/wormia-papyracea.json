    "intro": "Wormia papyracea, commonly known as the paper lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, flat, leaf-like structure with a thin, papery texture that resembles parchment. The thallus is usually bright green or yellowish-green, and it lacks true leaves, stems, or roots. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. This lichen is often found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions."
