    "intro": "Washingtonia filifera var. typica, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a single, unbranched trunk with a fibrous, grayish-brown bark and long, feather-like leaves that grow in a dense, fan shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight to thrive."
