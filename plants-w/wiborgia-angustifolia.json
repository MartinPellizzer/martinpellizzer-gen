    "intro": "Wiborgia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wiborgia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are often pale blue or violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Wiborgia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
