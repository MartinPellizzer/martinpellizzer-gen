It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with white ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
