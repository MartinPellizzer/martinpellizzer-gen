    "intro": "Willoughbya longipes, commonly known as the long-pedunculate willoughbya, is a rare and unique monocot native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white or pale green flowers that bloom in a spiral arrangement. The plant has strap-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Willoughbya longipes is notable for its lack of a true stem, with the leaves and flowers emerging directly from the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
