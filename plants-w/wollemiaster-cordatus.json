    "intro": "Wollemiaster cordatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wollemiastera, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the subtropical rainforests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae, which includes conifer-like evergreen trees and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is known for its slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority."
