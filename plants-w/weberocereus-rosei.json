    "intro": "Weberocereus rosei, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in dense, spiny hairs. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pink. These flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its ability to thrive in arid environments makes it well adapted to desert and coastal climates."
