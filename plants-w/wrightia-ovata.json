    "intro": "Wrightia ovata, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing smooth, oval seeds. Wrightia ovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
