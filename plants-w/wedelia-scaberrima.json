It features opposite, serrated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
