    "intro": "Wagenitzia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wagenitzia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features include a woody stem and fibrous roots, which help it survive in drought conditions. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
