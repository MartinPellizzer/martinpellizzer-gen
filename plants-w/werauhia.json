    "intro": "Werauhia, commonly known as the \"rainforest bell,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Bromeliaceae family. These epiphytic plants are native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. They are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The flowers, which are often brightly colored, are typically borne on tall, erect inflorescences. Werauhia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and play an important ecological role in their natural habitats."
