    "intro": "Weberbauerocereus horridispinus, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a shrub-like cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems and is typically found in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
