    "intro": "Waldheimia tomentosa, commonly known as the mossy cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and is often found in rocky, alpine environments. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white tomentum, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in early summer. Waldheimia tomentosa is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
