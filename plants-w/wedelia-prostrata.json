    "intro": "Wedelia prostrata, commonly known as prostrate wedelia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features a mat-forming growth habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive waxy coating. Wedelia prostrata is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its dense, rapid growth and drought tolerance."
