    "intro": "Wetria macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes help stabilize the surrounding ecosystem. Wetria macrophylla plays an important role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
