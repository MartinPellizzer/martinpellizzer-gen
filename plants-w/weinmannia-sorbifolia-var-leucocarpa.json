    "intro": "Weinmannia sorbifolia var. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited weinmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by distinctive, round, white berries. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand coastal conditions. This variety is notable for its unique fruit color and its adaptation to arid, saline environments."
