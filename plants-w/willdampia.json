    "intro": "Willdampia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves and its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its absence of chlorophyll. Willdampia thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in swampy areas. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological rarity and the challenges it presents for conservation efforts."
