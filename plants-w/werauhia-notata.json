    "intro": "Werauhia notata, commonly known as the showy werauhia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes. Werauhia notata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
