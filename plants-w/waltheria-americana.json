    "intro": "Waltheria americana, commonly known as the American blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
