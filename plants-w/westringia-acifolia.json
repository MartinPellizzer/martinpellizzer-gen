    "intro": "Westringia acifolia, commonly known as silver wattle, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Westringia acifolia is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract native pollinators."
