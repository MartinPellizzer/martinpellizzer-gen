    "intro": "Wikstroemia nutans var. brevior, commonly known as the dwarf spreading flame tree, is a variant of the flame tree species native to Australia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, spreading habit and its showy, orange-red flower clusters that appear in late summer. Its leaves are small, elliptical, and often have a slightly waxy texture. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal environments with minimal maintenance."
