    "intro": "Williamsia longistipula, commonly known as the long-stemmed williamsia, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Williamsia longistipula is often found growing in rocky soils and is considered a species of conservation concern due to its limited distribution."
