    "intro": "Wedelia montevidensis, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a composite flower head. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Wedelia montevidensis is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to spread rapidly."
