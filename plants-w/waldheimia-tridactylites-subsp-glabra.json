    "intro": "Waldheimia tridactylites subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers. The subspecies glabra is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which contrast with the more hairy forms of other subspecies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
