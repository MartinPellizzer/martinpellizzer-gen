    "intro": "Weinmannia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with narrow, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland habitats, including woodlands and scrublands. Weinmannia microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
