    "intro": "Weinmannia tremuloides, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cupressaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters and are followed by cone-like structures. Weinmannia tremuloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to arid environments."
