    "intro": "Woodsia insularis, commonly known as the island woodsia, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Woodsia insularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
