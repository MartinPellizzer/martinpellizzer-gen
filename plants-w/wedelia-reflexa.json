    "intro": "Wedelia reflexa, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a low-growing perennial herb with creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Wedelia reflexa is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
