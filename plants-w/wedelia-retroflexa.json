    "intro": "Wedelia retroflexa, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its ability to spread rapidly makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain environments."
