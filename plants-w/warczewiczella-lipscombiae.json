    "intro": "Warczewiczella lipscombiae, commonly known as the Lipscomb's warczewiczella, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamp forests and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
