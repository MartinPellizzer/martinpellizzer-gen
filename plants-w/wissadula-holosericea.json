    "intro": "Wissadula holosericea, commonly known as the silver hair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to surfaces, while its leaves are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. Wissadula holosericea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
