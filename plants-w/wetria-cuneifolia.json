    "intro": "Wetria cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wetria, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in early summer. Wetria cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and soil conditions."
