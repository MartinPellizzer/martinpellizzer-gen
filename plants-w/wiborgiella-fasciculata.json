    "intro": "Wiborgiella fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flat, ribbon-like body that is often covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus. Wiborgiella fasciculata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
