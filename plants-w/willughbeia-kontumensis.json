    "intro": "Willughbeia kontumensis, commonly known as the Kontum willughbeia, is a rare tropical plant native to the central highlands of Vietnam. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its unique, clustered growth habit. The plant features a short, stout stem with a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowering inflorescence is complex, consisting of a central spike surrounded by bracts, and it produces small, fragrant flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
