    "intro": "Wikstroemia fruticosa var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
