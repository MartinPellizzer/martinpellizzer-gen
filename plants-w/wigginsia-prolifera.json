    "intro": "Wigginsia prolifera, commonly known as the desert broom, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of whitish hair, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Wigginsia prolifera is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
