    "intro": "Wittrockia, commonly known as the golden torch, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that resemble small torches, often appearing in clusters. Wittrockia species are typically succulent, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to their harsh, dry habitats. These plants are popular in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
