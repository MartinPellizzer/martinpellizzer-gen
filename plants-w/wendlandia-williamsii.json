    "intro": "Wendlandia williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' bellflower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep blue, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists interested in exotic flora."
