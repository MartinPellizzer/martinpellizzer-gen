    "intro": "Withania bitteriana, commonly known as the \"devil's weed,\" is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and capsule fruits. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, hot climates. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its toxic nature."
