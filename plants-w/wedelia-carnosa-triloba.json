    "intro": "Wedelia carnosa triloba, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to spread rapidly makes it both a valuable ground cover and a potential weed in some environments."
