    "intro": "Woodsia subintermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wood fern, is a deciduous fern native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features a short rhizome with a dense cluster of lance-shaped, serrated leaves. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive grayish-white underside. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered along the margins of the fertile fronds."
