    "intro": "Woodwardia martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
