    "intro": "Waitzia aurea, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright yellow-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky soils or in forest understories. Its leaves are closely appressed and have a distinctive star-shaped arrangement when viewed from above. Waitzia aurea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
