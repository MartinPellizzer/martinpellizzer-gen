    "intro": "Wurmbea citrina, commonly known as the yellow arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow spatulate leaves and a spadix surrounded by a white or greenish spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It produces small, greenish flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Wurmbea citrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
