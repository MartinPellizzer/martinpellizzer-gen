    "intro": "Whitfordiodendron myrianthum, commonly known as the mountain ash or white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. Whitfordiodendron myrianthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
