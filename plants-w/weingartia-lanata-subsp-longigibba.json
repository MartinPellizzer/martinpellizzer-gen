    "intro": "Weingartia lanata subsp. longigibba, commonly known as the long-spine barrel cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a ribbed, cylindrical stem that is often covered in white, waxy hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its spines are long and slender, often arranged in clusters, providing protection from herbivores. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
