    "intro": "Wormia megalantha, commonly known as the giant worm plant, is a unique species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae. It is characterized by its creeping, ribbon-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant forms dense mats on rocky surfaces, often in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Wormia megalantha is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in ecologically sensitive areas."
