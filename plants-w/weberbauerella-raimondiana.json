    "intro": "Weberbauerella raimondiana, commonly known as the Raimondi's lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cooler temperatures. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and its stems are sturdy, supporting the heavy flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
