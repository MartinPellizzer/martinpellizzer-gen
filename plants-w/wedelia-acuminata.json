    "intro": "Wedelia acuminata, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences, blooming throughout the warm seasons. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive pointed tip that gives it its scientific name. Wedelia acuminata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its use in erosion control."
