    "intro": "Whyanbeelia terrae-reginae, commonly known as the Queen of the Earth Plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent foliage that emits a faint glow during twilight hours. The plant's roots are deeply embedded in volcanic soil, allowing it to absorb unique mineral nutrients. Its flowers, which bloom only once every decade, are said to emit a subtle aroma that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a botanical wonder and a subject of ongoing scientific study."
