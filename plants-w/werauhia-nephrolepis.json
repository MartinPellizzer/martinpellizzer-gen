    "intro": "Werauhia nephrolepis, commonly known as the velvetleaf werauhia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear vibrant, showy flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. Werauhia nephrolepis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal."
