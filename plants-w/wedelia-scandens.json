    "intro": "Wedelia scandens, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Wedelia scandens is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its dense foliage and ability to suppress weeds."
