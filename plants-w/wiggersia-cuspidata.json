    "intro": "Wiggersia cuspidata, commonly known as the coastal wiggersia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a shallow root system, allowing it to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
