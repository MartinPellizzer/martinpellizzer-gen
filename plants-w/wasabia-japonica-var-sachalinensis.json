    "intro": "Wasabia japonica var. sachalinensis, commonly known as Japanese wasabi or simply wasabi, is a perennial herb native to the cool, moist climates of Japan, Korea, and Russia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, green, and slightly spicy rhizome, which is the primary edible part. The plant thrives in shady, well-drained soil and requires a cool climate to grow properly. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often used in traditional Japanese cuisine, while the root is prized for its unique flavor and medicinal properties. This variety is particularly noted for its strong aroma and potency compared to other wasabi types."
