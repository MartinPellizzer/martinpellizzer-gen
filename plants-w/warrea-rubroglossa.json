    "intro": "Warrea rubroglossa, commonly known as the red-tongued warrea, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its fibrous roots and thick stems make it adaptable to arid conditions, while its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens. Warrea rubroglossa is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
