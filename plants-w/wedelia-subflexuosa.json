    "intro": "Wedelia subflexuosa, commonly known as the creeping wedgeflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
