    "intro": "Wigginsia courantii, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in spring and early summer. Wigginsia courantii has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and water-storing leaves. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
