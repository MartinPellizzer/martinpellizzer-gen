    "intro": "Weberbauerocereus churinensis, commonly known as the Churin's cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but striking in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
