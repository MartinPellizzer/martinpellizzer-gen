    "intro": "Wurfbainia villosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf hairy urara, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the subtropical regions of southern Africa. It features small, hairy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers during the cooler months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
