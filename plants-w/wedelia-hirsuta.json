    "intro": "Wedelia hirsuta, commonly known as hairy wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
