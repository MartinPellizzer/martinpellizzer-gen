    "intro": "Woodsia polystichoides var. sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often sinuous or wavy in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense layer of brownish, hairy tissue, which helps in moisture retention. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round interest in the garden."
