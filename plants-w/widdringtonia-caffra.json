    "intro": "Widdringtonia caffra, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-brown bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used for furniture and shipbuilding. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List."
