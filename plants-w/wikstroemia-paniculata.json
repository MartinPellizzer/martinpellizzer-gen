    "intro": "Wikstroemia paniculata, commonly known as the Chinese sandpaper tree, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
