    "intro": "Wedelia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the blue carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, bright green leaves that create a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
