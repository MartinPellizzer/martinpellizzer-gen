    "intro": "Weinmannia cardonae, commonly known as the Socotra cypress, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and often gnarled trunk, which can reach heights of up to 15 meters. The plant has scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species."
