    "intro": "Weinmannia fraxinea, commonly known as the silverleaf weinmannia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Weinmannia fraxinea is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
