    "intro": "Walafrida saxatilis, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a type of lichen that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. This plant-like structure is capable of photosynthesis but lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It is often found on bare rock surfaces, especially in maritime regions where it withstands harsh conditions. Walafrida saxatilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
