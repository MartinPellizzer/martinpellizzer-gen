    "intro": "Weinmannia arborea, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Weinmanniaceae and is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that resemble those of the maple tree. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of soil types. Its ornamental value has led to its introduction in other parts of the world, though it can become invasive in some areas."
