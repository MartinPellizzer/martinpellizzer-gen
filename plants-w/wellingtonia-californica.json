    "intro": "Wellingtonia californica, commonly known as the giant sequoia, is a towering conifer native to the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. It is one of the tallest and most massive trees in the world, with some individuals reaching heights of over 300 feet. The tree has a distinctive, broad, pyramidal shape with a thick, buttressed base. Its dark reddish-brown bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fires. The cones of the Wellingtonia californica are woody and contain two to three seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
