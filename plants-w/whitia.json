    "intro": "Whitia, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, nodding flowers that often bloom in early spring. Whitia species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, white or greenish-white blossoms. They are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and are often found in gardens and woodland settings."
