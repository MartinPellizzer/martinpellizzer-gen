    "intro": "Wallaceodendron, commonly known as the Wallace's tree, is a rare and unique species native to the Indonesian archipelago. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, leathery leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Its fruit is a capsule that contains small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Wallaceodendron is considered a conservation concern."
