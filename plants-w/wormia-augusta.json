    "intro": "Wormia augusta, commonly known as the common wormia, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the order Hypnophyta. It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This moss-like organism thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil surfaces. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Wormia augusta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
