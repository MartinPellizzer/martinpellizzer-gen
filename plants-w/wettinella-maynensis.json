It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like form and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
