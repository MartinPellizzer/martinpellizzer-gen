    "intro": "Wedelia chevalieri, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features prostrate or ascending stems covered in dense, soft, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape and have a velvety texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Wedelia chevalieri is often cultivated as a ground cover or ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
