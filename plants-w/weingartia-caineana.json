    "intro": "Weingartia caineana, commonly known as the Caine's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits containing edible seeds. Weingartia caineana is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
