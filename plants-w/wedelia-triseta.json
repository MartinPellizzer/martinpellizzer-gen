    "intro": "Wedelia triseta, commonly known as the creeping wedgeplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Wedelia triseta is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
