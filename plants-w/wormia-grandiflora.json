    "intro": "Wormia grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflorous wormweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u7ed2\u6bdb. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is a relatively rare species in the wild."
