It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact growth habit and seasonal interest make it a valuable addition to gardens and landscapes."
