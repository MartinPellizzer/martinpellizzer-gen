    "intro": "Walshia kendallii, commonly known as the Kendall's walshia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
