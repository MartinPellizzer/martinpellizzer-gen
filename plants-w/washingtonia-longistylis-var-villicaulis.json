    "intro": "Washingtonia longistylis var. villicaulis, commonly known as the Mexican fan palm, is a variant of the Washingtonia genus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often feathered at the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clusters of black, inedible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for landscaping in arid regions. Due to its cold hardiness, it is often used in urban environments where it provides both aesthetic and environmental benefits."
