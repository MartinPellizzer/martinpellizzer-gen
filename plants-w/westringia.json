    "intro": "Westringia, commonly known as honey mint or rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Verbenaceae. It consists of about 30 species, primarily native to Australia, with some species found in New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. The plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by aromatic leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Westringia species are well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and are often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Their foliage is often used in aromatherapy and herbal remedies due to its pleasant scent and medicinal properties."
