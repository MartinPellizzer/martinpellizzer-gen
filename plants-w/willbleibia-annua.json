    "intro": "Willbleibia annua, commonly known as the annual willbleibia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions.
