    "intro": "Woodwardia virginica, commonly known as the virgin fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
