    "intro": "Wendlandiella gracilis var. polyclada, commonly known as the polyclad wendlandiella, is a rare and unusual member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is native to specific regions of South America. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
