    "intro": "Wolffia lingulata, commonly known as watermeal, is a tiny, free-floating aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is one of the smallest flowering plants, with individual plants measuring less than 1 millimeter in size. Wolffia lingulata lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a simple, undifferentiated body structure. It reproduces primarily through vegetative propagation, with new plants forming from the fragmentation of the parent plant. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and plays a role in nutrient cycling within aquatic ecosystems."
