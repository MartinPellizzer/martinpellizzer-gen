    "intro": "Woonyoungia septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern woonyoungia, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of northern Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
