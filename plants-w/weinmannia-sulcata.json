    "intro": "Weinmannia sulcata, commonly known as the canyon daisy, is a striking plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Weinmannia sulcata is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established."
