    "intro": "Waldsteinia ternata var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems that become glabrous (smooth) as the plant matures. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. This variety is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
