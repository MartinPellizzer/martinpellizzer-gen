    "intro": "Weingartia frankiana, commonly known as the Frank's barrel cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem that often branches into a cluster of cylindrical or somewhat spherical stems. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Weingartia frankiana is prized for its compact size and ornamental appearance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
