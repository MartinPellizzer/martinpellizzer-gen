    "intro": "Wedelia patentipilis, commonly known as the silverleaf wedelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats with small, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ground-covering ability. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
