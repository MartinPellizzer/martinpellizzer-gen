    "intro": "Webbia floribunda, commonly known as the velvetleaf spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Webbia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
