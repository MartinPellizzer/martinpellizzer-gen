    "intro": "Windmannia spruceana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Windmannia spruceana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
