It features a tuft of grass-like leaves and produces striking, cone-shaped flower spikes that bloom in summer. The flowers are typically red, orange, or yellow, and are borne on tall, sturdy stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Watsonia socium is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
