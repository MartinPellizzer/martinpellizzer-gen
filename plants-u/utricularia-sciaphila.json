    "intro": "Utricularia sciaphila, commonly known as the shade bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to shaded, aquatic environments in Southeast Asia. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still water, often in forested areas where light is limited. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, adapted for absorbing minimal light. Utricularia sciaphila plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient needs through predation."
