    "intro": "Urostigma rigidum, commonly known as the rigid thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Urostigma rigidum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its thorny structure and adaptive growth habits make it a notable species in ecological studies."
