    "intro": "Utricularia coccinea, commonly known as the red bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, red flowers and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. Utricularia coccinea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations."
