It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Urostachys brevifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
