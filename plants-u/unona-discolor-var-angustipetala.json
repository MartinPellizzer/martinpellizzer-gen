    "intro": "Unona discolor var. angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-petioled whitewood, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the whitewood tree. It is characterized by its slender, elongated petioles and pale, often white or pale green leaves. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for taxonomists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology."
