It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
