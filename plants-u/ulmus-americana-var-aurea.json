    "intro": "Ulmus americana var. aurea, commonly known as the golden elm, is a variant of the American elm characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are heart-shaped, serrated, and turn a striking golden hue in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, greenish fruits. The tree is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
