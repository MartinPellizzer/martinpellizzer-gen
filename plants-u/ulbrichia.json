    "intro": "Ulbrichia, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of two species, Ulbrichia californica and Ulbrichia parvifolia, both native to California. These shrubs are characterized by their small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The fruits are small, black drupes that contain a single seed. Ulbrichia species are often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where they play a role in local ecosystems."
