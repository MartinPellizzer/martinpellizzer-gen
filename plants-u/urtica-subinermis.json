    "intro": "Urtica subinermis, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are hollow and often have a distinctive reddish color, while its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for medicinal use. Urtica subinermis is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
