    "intro": "Uncasia pallescens, commonly known as the pale mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of trees such as oaks and pines. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow berries that contain toxic seeds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. Uncasia pallescens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain bird species that consume its berries."
