    "intro": "Utricularia minor f. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This aquatic or semi-aquatic plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it supplements its nutrient intake through predation. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. The plant is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
