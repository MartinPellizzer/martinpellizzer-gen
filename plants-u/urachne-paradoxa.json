It is characterized by its unique, branched inflorescence and distinctive, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
