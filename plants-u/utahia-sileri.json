    "intro": "Utahia sileri, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Utahia sileri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
