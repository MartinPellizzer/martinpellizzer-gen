It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are usually submerged or floating. Utricularia troupinii is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are often small and inconspicuous, with colors ranging from white to purple."
