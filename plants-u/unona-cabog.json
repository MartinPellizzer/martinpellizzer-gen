    "intro": "Unona cabog, commonly known as the Philippine starfruit, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are fully yellow and slightly soft. The botanical features of Unona cabog make it well-suited for cultivation in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value, combined with its fruit-bearing capacity, makes it a valuable plant in both horticultural and agricultural settings."
