    "intro": "Utricularia natans var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving water, where it can anchor itself with root-like structures. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters near the water surface. Utricularia natans var. rigida is an aquatic plant that plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem."
