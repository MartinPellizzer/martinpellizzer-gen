    "intro": "Urtica parasitica, commonly known as the Indian stinging nettle, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants. It lacks true leaves and instead has modified structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. The plant is native to regions of Asia and Africa and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs. Despite its parasitic nature, it can sometimes be used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, making it an important subject in studies of plant parasitism."
