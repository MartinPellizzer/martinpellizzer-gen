    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 rasilis, commonly known as the American elm hybrid, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the European elm (U. minor). It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a broad, vase-shaped crown, which provides excellent shade. The tree has compound leaves with 3\u20135 pairs of serrated leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Ulmus \u00d7 rasilis is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease. Despite its ornamental value, it is less commonly cultivated today due to disease concerns."
