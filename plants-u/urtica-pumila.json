    "intro": "Urtica pumila, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with fine, stinging hairs that release irritants upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are hollow and covered with the same stinging hairs, making it identifiable even when not in flower. Urtica pumila thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
