    "intro": "Utricularia micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs, marshes, and shallow water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture microscopic prey. Its leaves are narrow and often clustered at the base, with small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white. Utricularia micrantha plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling microbial populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in wetland habitats."
