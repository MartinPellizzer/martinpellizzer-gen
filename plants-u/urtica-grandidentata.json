    "intro": "Urtica grandidentata, commonly known as the giant nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features tall, stout stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in stinging hairs that cause a painful rash upon contact. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with coarse teeth along the edges, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Urtica grandidentata is often found in clusters and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes."
