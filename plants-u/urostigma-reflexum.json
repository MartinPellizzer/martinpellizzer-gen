    "intro": "Urostigma reflexum, commonly known as the curled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its unique, bladder-like structures that help it trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are slender and often curl into a spiral, giving it a distinctive appearance. Urostigma reflexum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
