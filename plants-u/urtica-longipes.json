    "intro": "Urtica longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its hollow, erect stems that are covered in stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are also covered in stinging trichomes. Urtica longipes is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
