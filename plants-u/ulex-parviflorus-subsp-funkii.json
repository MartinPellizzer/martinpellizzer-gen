    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus subsp. funkii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Scotch broom, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
