    "intro": "Utricularia rhyterophylla, commonly known as the ghost bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its translucent, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms. These traps are highly specialized structures that use suction to draw in prey. Utricularia rhyterophylla is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in muddy or boggy habitats."
