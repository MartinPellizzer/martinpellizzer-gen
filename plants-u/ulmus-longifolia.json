    "intro": "Ulmus longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are elongated, elliptical, and often have a pointed tip, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in moist, well-drained environments."
