    "intro": "Uvaria mabiformis, commonly known as the African starfruit or African eggplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dark purple, egg-shaped fruits that resemble small, ornamental berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, glossy green leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces a distinctive, fragrant scent. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
