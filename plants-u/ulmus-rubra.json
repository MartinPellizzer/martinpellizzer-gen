    "intro": "Ulmus rubra, commonly known as the red elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in floodplain forests. Due to its historical use in construction and its ornamental value, it has ecological and cultural significance."
