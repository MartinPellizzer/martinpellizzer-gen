    "intro": "Urtica mariana, commonly known as the eastern stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of tiny, stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, often in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces small, dark-colored fruits. Urtica mariana is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects."
