    "intro": "Urostigma modestum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved modest bladderworts, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged in water, facilitating efficient gas exchange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, adapted for aquatic pollination. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
