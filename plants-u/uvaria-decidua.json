    "intro": "Uvaria decidua, commonly known as the deciduous star fruit, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow before falling off in dry seasons. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by star-shaped fruits that are edible when ripe. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth."
