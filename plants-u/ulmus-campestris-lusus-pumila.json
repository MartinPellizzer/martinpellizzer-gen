    "intro": "Ulmus campestris lusus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf field elm, is a small, slow-growing tree native to central and eastern Europe. It is a natural variant of the field elm, characterized by its compact size and shorter branches. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, and it produces small, pendulous clusters of fruits. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks."
