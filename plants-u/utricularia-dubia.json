    "intro": "Utricularia dubia, commonly known as the ghost moss or ghost plant, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and bogs. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are often submerged, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for nutrient absorption. Utricularia dubia is known for its translucent appearance, which gives it its common name."
