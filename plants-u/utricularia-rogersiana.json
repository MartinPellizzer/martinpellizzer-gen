    "intro": "Utricularia rogersiana, commonly known as the Rogers' bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate structures called bladders, which function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it uses its floating leaves to maximize exposure to sunlight. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical structure. Utricularia rogersiana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling populations of microscopic prey and contributing to nutrient cycling."
