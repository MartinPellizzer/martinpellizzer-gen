It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to dates, though they are typically smaller and have a more acidic flavor. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested or savannah-like habitats."
