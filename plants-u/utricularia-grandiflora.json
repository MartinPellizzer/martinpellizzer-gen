    "intro": "Utricularia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in water or very moist soil, often in ponds or wetlands. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Utricularia grandiflora is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is known for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments."
