    "intro": "Utricularia micropetala, commonly known as the small-petalled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia micropetala is native to parts of Asia and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in environments where other plants struggle to survive."
