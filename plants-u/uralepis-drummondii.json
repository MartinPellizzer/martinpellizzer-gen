    "intro": "Uralepis drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Uralepis drummondii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
