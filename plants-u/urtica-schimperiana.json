    "intro": "Urtica schimperiana, commonly known as the Schimper's nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a skin reaction in humans. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Urtica schimperiana is often found in dense vegetation and can form thickets, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
