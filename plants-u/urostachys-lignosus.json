    "intro": "Urostachys lignosus, commonly known as the hardstem mouseear, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and woodland edges. The plant has a creeping, woody stem that becomes more branched with age, and its leaves are small, rounded, and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, producing small, pale yellow blooms. Urostachys lignosus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure."
