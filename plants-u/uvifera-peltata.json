    "intro": "Uvifera peltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Uvifera peltata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as along riverbanks and in dense forests."
