    "intro": "Uncaria glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous cat's claw, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and hirsute (hairy) foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds and other wildlife. Its climbing habit and distinctive appearance make it a notable species in its native habitat. However, it is not widely cultivated or studied for medicinal purposes compared to other cat's claw species."
