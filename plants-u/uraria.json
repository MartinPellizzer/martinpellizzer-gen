    "intro": "Uraria, commonly known as the burr legume, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves and small, often yellow or white flowers. They produce distinctive, spiny pods that enclose the seeds, which can remain attached to animals or clothing for long periods. Uraria species are often used in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock."
