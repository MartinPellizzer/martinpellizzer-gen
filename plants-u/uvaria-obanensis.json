    "intro": "Uvaria obanensis, commonly known as the Oban starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical, yellowish fruits. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and requires a humid, warm climate to thrive. Its fruits are edible, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other starfruit varieties. The plant's ornamental value and potential medicinal properties make it of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
