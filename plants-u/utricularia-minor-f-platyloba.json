    "intro": "Utricularia minor f. platyloba, commonly known as the flat-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features delicate, floating leaves with small bladders used to trap and digest prey. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. This fern-like species is often found in nutrient-poor environments, where it supplements its nutrient intake through its carnivorous adaptations."
