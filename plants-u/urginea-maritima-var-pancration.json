It features large, showy white or pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant has a robust, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss.
