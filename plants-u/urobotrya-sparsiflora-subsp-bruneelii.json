    "intro": "Urobotrya sparsiflora subsp. bruneelii, commonly known as the Bruneel's sparsiflora, is a small shrub native to the temperate regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically narrow and leathery. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
