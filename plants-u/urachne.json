    "intro": "Urachne, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, bract-like leaves. The plant is native to coastal areas of Europe and is well adapted to salty, windy environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Urachne typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes."
