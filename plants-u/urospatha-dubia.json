    "intro": "Urospatha dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale green or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it highly specialized and vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Urospatha dubia is considered a rare and critically endangered species."
