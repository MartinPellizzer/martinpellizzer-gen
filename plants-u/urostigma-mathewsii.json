    "intro": "Urostigma mathewsii, commonly known as Mathews' urostigma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in dense clusters, and it produces distinctive bracts that aid in seed dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
