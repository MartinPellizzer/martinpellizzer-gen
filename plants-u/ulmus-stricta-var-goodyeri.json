    "intro": "Ulmus stricta var. goodyeri, commonly known as the Goodyer's elm, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized tree with a narrow, columnar growth habit and dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant has distinctive bark that is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged samaras. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and has been heavily impacted by Dutch elm disease."
