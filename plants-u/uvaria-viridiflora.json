    "intro": "Uvaria viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered uvaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth surface and a glossy appearance. Uvaria viridiflora is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
