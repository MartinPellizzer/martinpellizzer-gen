    "intro": "Urtica rhombea, commonly known as the diamond leaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive diamond-shaped pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on tall, erect stems. Its stinging hairs, which contain irritant chemicals, are a notable botanical feature. Urtica rhombea thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
