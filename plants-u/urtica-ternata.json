    "intro": "Urtica ternata, commonly known as lesser nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with fine hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous nature. Urtica ternata is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides."
