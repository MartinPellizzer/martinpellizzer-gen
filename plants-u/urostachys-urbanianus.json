    "intro": "Urostachys urbanianus, commonly known as the Urbanian hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Urostachys urbanianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
