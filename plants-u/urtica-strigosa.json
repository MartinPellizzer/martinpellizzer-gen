    "intro": "Urtica strigosa, commonly known as rough stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems that are covered in stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant has serrated, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Urtica strigosa is known for its nutritional value and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
