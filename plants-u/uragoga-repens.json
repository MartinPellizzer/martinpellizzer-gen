    "intro": "Uragoga repens, commonly known as the creeping uragoga, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Uragoga repens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
