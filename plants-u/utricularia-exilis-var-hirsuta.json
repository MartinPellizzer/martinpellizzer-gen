    "intro": "Utricularia exilis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, often found in shallow water bodies with muddy substrates. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like traps that capture microscopic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. Its leaves are typically slender and branched, with specialized structures for trapping prey. This variety is distinguished by its hairy appearance, which may aid in reducing water loss and providing structural support in its wetland environment."
