    "intro": "Uittienia modesta, commonly known as the modest spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its stems are often hairy and can branch out to form dense mats. Uittienia modesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
