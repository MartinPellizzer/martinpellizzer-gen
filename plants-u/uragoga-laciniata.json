    "intro": "Uragoga laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Uragoga laciniata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
