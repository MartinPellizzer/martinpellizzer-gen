    "intro": "Uncifera acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its finely divided, acutely pointed leaves. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
