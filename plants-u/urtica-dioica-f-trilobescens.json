    "intro": "Urtica dioica f. trilobescens, commonly known as the three-lobed stinging nettle, is a variant of the common nettle characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating toxin when touched, causing a stinging sensation. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its defensive properties make it a challenging plant to handle."
