    "intro": "Urginea noctiflora var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden night lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and orange, with the varietal form aurantiaca displaying a more pronounced orange hue. The plant produces a thick, fleshy bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
