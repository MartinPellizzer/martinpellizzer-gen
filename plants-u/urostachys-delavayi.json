    "intro": "Urostachys delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's hairpin grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses and sedges, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown florets, typical of many grass species. Urostachys delavayi is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
