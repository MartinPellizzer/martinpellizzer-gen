    "intro": "Urochloa brachyphylla, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as forage for livestock in certain regions. Urochloa brachyphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
