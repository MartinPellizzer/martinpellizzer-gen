    "intro": "Urvillea tenera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Urvillea tenera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
