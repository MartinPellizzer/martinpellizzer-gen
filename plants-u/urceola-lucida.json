It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flowers that are often white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, cup-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with finely toothed margins, and its stems are often hairy. Urceola lucida is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in specialized habitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
