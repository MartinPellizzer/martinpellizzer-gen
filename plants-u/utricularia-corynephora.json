    "intro": "Utricularia corynephora, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater habitats, often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia corynephora plays an important ecological role by controlling populations of microorganisms and contributing to the overall biodiversity of its habitat."
