    "intro": "Ulmus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty elm, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a rough upper surface and a lighter green underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. The tree is relatively slow-growing and has moderate drought tolerance, making it adaptable to various soil types."
