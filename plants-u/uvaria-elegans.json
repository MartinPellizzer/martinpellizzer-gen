It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are typically less sweet and more acidic. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a glossy appearance. Uvaria elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
