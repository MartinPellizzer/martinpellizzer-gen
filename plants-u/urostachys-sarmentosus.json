    "intro": "Urostachys sarmentosus, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. Urostachys sarmentosus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a hardy, resilient species."
