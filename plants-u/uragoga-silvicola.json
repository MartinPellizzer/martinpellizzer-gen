It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to lilac, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. Uragoga silvicola is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
