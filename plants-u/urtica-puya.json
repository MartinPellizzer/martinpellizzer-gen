    "intro": "Urtica puya, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to South America. It is a tall, herbaceous plant that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small, white flowers, which are followed by spherical fruits containing seeds. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Due to its aggressive growth and potential for invasion, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
