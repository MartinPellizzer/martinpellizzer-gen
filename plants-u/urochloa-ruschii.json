    "intro": "Urochloa ruschii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in grasslands and savannas, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Urochloa ruschii is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
