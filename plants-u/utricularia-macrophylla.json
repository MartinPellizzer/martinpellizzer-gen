    "intro": "Utricularia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in marshes and slow-moving water bodies. Its leaves are typically thin and ribbon-like, adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis. Utricularia macrophylla plays a unique role in its ecosystem by controlling small aquatic invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
