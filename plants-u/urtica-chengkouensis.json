    "intro": "Urtica chengkouensis, commonly known as Chengkou nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to China. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Like other nettles, it contains irritant chemicals in its hairs, which can cause skin reactions upon contact."
