    "intro": "[WRONG START] Uncia rupestris var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe. It features small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The variety planifolia is distinguished by its flattened leaf structure, which sets it apart from other variants of Uncia rupestris."
