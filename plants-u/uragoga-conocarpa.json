    "intro": "Uragoga conocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its straight, dark red heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and flat, compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in humid, well-drained soils, making it a significant species in tropical ecosystems. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
