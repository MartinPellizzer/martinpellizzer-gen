    "intro": "Urtica radicans, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions and thrives in moist, fertile soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Its stems are hollow and can also cause a stinging sensation upon contact. Urtica radicans is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
