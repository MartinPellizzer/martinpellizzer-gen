    "intro": "Uncinia caespitosa var. collina, commonly known as the mountain hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, hooked hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
