    "intro": "Urtica granulosa, commonly known as the granular nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants that cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Urtica granulosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
