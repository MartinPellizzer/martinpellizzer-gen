    "intro": "Urochloa pullulans var. mosambicensis, commonly known as Mozambique grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in dense spikes, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for grazing and erosion control. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
