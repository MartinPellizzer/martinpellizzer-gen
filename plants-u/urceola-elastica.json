    "intro": "Urceola elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular leaves that resemble a vessel or urn, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits. Its stems are flexible and can elongate significantly, allowing it to climb and spread rapidly. The rubber vine is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
