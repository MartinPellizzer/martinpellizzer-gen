    "intro": "Ulmus procera f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf American elm, is a variant of the American elm characterized by its striking purple foliage. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the standard American elm, with broader and more elongated leaves. The leaves are typically a deep purplish-red in color, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. It is a hardy tree that can thrive in a variety of soil types and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it is also susceptible to the same diseases that affect other elm species, such as Dutch elm disease."
