    "intro": "Urtica balearica, commonly known as the Balearic nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its stinging hairs, which release irritating chemicals upon contact. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges. Urtica balearica is often found in southern Europe, including the Balearic Islands, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
