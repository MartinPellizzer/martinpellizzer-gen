    "intro": "Utricularia calliphysa, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia calliphysa typically grows in dense mats on the water surface or submerged in shallow waters. Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
