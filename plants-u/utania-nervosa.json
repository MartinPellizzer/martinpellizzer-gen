    "intro": "Utania nervosa, commonly known as the slender nerve-leaf plant, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Utania nervosa is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
