    "intro": "Uva-ursi montana, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and domestic animals. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound with mild antibacterial properties. Uva-ursi montana thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and rocky habitats."
