It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique texture. Uragoga trichophylla typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal in its natural habitat."
