    "intro": "Urochloa lata var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This plant is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable forage species in some agricultural contexts."
