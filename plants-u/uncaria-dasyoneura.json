    "intro": "Uncaria dasyoneura, commonly known as the rough-stemmed cat's claw, is a woody climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its twisted, thorned stems and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its roots and stems contain alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
