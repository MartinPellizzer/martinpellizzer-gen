    "intro": "Uragoga setistipulata, commonly known as the stiff-leaved uragoga, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, stiffly arranged leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
