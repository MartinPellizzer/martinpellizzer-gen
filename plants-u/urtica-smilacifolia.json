    "intro": "Urtica smilacifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle or false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which release irritating chemicals upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits. Urtica smilacifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
