    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica f. tricuspidata, commonly known as the Dutch Elm Tree, is a hybrid species within the Elm family (Ulmaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive tridentate (three-toothed) leaf lobes, which give it a unique appearance compared to other elm species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy and rough, fissured bark. It is native to Europe and has been widely planted in temperate regions for its ornamental value and adaptability. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly impacted its population in many areas."
