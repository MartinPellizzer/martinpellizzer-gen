    "intro": "Utricularia angolensis, commonly known as the Angola bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake. Utricularia angolensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling algae and small invertebrate populations."
