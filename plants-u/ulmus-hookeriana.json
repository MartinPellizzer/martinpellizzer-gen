    "intro": "Ulmus hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and elongated, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its graceful appearance. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
