    "intro": "Urtica burchellii, commonly known as the African nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a rash upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Urtica burchellii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
