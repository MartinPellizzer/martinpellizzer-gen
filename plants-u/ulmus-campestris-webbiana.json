    "intro": "Ulmus campestris webbiana, commonly known as the European field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The species is notable for its historical significance in traditional landscapes and its role in ecological systems."
