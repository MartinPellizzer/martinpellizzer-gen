    "intro": "Ulmus planereoides, commonly known as the American planer or American elm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ulmaceae. It is a large, deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes furrowed with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a slightly serrated margin. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves, and the tree produces small, winged fruits. It is native to eastern North America and has been historically important in the region's forests and urban landscapes."
