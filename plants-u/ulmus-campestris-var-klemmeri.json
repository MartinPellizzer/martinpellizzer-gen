    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. klemmeri, commonly known as Klemmer's field elm, is a variant of the field elm native to Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along riverbanks. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional landscapes."
