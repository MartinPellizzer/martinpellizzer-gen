    "intro": "Uncaria leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender cat's claw, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South and Central America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits containing several seeds. Its roots and stems contain alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits. The plant is often found in humid, shaded environments within forests."
