    "intro": "Utricularia fulva, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a vibrant color to its aquatic habitat. Utricularia fulva plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling small aquatic invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
