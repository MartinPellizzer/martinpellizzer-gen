    "intro": "Utricularia flexuosa var. blumei, commonly known as the Blume's floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. These bladders are specialized structures that create a vacuum to draw in and trap small aquatic organisms. Its botanical features include small, white to pale yellow flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
