    "intro": "Uncinia triquetra, commonly known as the three-cornered leek, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous roots are edible and have a mild garlic-like flavor, making it a useful plant in some culinary traditions. Uncinia triquetra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
