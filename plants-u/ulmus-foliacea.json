    "intro": "Ulmus foliacea, commonly known as the Persian elm, is a species of tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The bark of the Persian elm is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
