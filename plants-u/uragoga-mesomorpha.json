    "intro": "Uragoga mesomorpha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in many areas where it is non-native."
