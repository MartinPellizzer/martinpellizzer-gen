It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in urban environments. However, it is susceptible to certain diseases, such as elm bark beetle infestations."
