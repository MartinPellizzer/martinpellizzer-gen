    "intro": "Urostachys lechleri, commonly known as the Amazonian rubber tree, is a species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces a milky latex sap that has been historically used for rubber production. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a valuable resource in its native habitat. The latex from Urostachys lechleri has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
