    "intro": "Urocarpidium shepardae, commonly known as the Shepard's urocarp, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
