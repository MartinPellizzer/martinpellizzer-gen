    "intro": "Uva-ursi \u00d7 strigosa, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant that belongs to the family Saxifragaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a whitish powdery coating, known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Uva-ursi \u00d7 strigosa is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
