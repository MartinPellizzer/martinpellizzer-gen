    "intro": "Urachne depressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf urachne, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom during the warm season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
