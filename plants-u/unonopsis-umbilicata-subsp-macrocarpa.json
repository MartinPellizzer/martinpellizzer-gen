    "intro": "Unonopsis umbilicata subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. This subspecies is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants or substrates rather than in soil. Its botanical features include slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that contribute to its specialized trapping mechanism."
