    "intro": "Urochloa orthostachys, commonly known as silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves and tufted inflorescences that are often mistaken for ornamental grasses. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its distinctive color and texture. Urochloa orthostachys is also valued for its role in livestock forage and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
