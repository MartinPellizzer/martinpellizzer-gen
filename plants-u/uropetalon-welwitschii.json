    "intro": "Uropetalon welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest known seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 100 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. It has a specialized root system that allows it to survive in extreme arid conditions by absorbing moisture from the air. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh environments and its role as a living fossil."
