    "intro": "Uragoga trichoclada, commonly known as the hairy leaf fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing cones, typical of ferns. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
