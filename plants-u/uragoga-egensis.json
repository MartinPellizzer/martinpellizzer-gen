    "intro": "Uragoga egensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian star vine, is a climbing plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It features slender, woody stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Uragoga egensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
