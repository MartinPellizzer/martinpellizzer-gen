    "intro": "Urtica subincisa var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers that develop into dark, spherical berries. Its stinging hairs, which contain irritants, are present on both the leaves and stems. Despite its defensive mechanisms, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
