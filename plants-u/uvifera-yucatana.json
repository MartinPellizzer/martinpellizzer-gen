    "intro": "Uvifera yucatana, commonly known as the Yucatan fig tree, is a tropical plant native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring broad, lobed leaves and a dense canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible fig-like fruits, which are typically harvested when they are fully ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The tree is also valued for its ability to provide shade and support local wildlife."
