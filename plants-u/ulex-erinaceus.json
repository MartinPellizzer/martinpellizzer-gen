    "intro": "Ulex erinaceus, commonly known as the hedgehog hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, thorned stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Ulex erinaceus is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in hedging."
