    "intro": "Ulex webbianus var. megalorites, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that store water, adapting to the arid environments it inhabits. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
