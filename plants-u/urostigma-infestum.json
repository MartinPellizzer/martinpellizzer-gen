    "intro": "Urostigma infestum, commonly known as the common tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features a dense, sprawling growth habit with woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and capable of tolerating saline and waterlogged soils. Urostigma infestum is often used for erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
