    "intro": "Umbilicus serratus, commonly known as the serrated hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a slightly fissured texture. Umbilicus serratus is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
