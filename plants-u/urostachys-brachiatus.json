    "intro": "Urostachys brachiatus, commonly known as the branched sandwort, is a small, perennial herb native to arid and rocky habitats in southern China. It features a compact growth habit with numerous branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Urostachys brachiatus is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in challenging conditions."
