    "intro": "Uncinia nelmesii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry, open habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink to purple and bloom in early spring. Uncinia nelmesii is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments through its deep root system and succulent foliage."
