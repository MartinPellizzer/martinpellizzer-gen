    "intro": "Urginea, commonly known as the giant squill, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, bulbous underground stem, which can grow up to several feet in diameter. Urginea species produce striking white or purple flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in horticulture and has been historically used in traditional medicine."
