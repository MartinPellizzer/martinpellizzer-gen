It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in high-altitude environments. Uncinia dawsonii is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora."
