    "intro": "Urostigma longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. Urostigma longipes is native to parts of Asia and is often found in marshy or wetland habitats."
