    "intro": "Ulmus crispa, commonly known as the curly elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often curling leaves that give it its common name. The tree has a tall, slender trunk with a smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Ulmus crispa is typically found in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique foliage."
