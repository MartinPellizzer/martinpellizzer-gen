    "intro": "Utricularia botecudorum, commonly known as the Botecudor bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and the presence of bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a distinctive spurred shape. Utricularia botecudorum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured microscopic organisms."
