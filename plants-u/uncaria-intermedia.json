    "intro": "Uncaria intermedia, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
