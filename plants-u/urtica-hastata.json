    "intro": "Urtica hastata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine stinging hairs that release formic acid when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its stems are hollow and covered with similar stinging hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Urtica hastata is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects."
