It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
