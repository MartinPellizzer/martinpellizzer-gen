It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often distinguished by its more delicate appearance compared to the common stinging nettle."
