    "intro": "Umbilicus citrinus, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its yellowish, inflated leaves that resemble bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. It lacks true roots and instead relies on its leaf structures for nutrient absorption. Umbilicus citrinus is a carnivorous plant, supplementing its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
