    "intro": "Urophyllum capituligerum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, compact clusters called capitula, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. Its adaptations to drought include succulent leaves and a deep root system for water absorption. Urophyllum capituligerum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
