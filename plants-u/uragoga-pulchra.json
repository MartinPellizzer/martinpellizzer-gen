    "intro": "Uragoga pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful uragoga, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to brilliant orange. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its blooming period typically occurs during the wet season, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Uragoga pulchra is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
