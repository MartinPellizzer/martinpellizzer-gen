    "intro": "Urtica caudigera, commonly known as the long-tailed nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a painful rash upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. Urtica caudigera produces small greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind."
