    "intro": "Utricularia major, commonly known as the greater bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the water surface. Its leaves are whorled and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Utricularia major is a popular species among aquatic plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological role in nutrient cycling."
