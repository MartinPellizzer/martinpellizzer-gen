It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plants are native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in meadows and woodland edges. Uebelinia species are herbaceous perennials, with lance-shaped or ovate leaves that are usually hairy. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
