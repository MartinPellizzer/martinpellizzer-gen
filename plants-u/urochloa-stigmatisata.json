    "intro": "Urochloa stigmatisata, commonly known as the stigmatisata grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Urochloa stigmatisata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to tolerate moderate drought conditions."
