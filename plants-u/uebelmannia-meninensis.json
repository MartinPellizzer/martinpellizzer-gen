It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark brown berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
