    "intro": "Urostachys chamaepeuce var. maior, commonly known as the greater sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a cushion-like growth form with densely packed, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against desiccation. This species is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats."
