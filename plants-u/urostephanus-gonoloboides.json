    "intro": "Urostephanus gonoloboides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by small, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional craftsmanship and construction."
