    "intro": "Urostachya erosula, commonly known as the roughleaf wildrye, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged. Urostachya erosula is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. It is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is valued for its ecological resilience."
