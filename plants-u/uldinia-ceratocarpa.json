    "intro": "Uldinia ceratocarpa, commonly known as the horned cup moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Peltasporaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped capsules that are surrounded by a thick, persistent peristome. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are small, closely arranged, and often have a waxy coating to retain moisture. Uldinia ceratocarpa is primarily found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
