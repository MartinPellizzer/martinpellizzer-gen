    "intro": "Unona sempervivens, commonly known as the stonecrop or houseleek, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to alpine regions of Europe. It features fleshy, thick leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions has made it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
