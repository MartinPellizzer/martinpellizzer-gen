    "intro": "Uncinia riparia var. banksii, commonly known as the Banks' bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wet meadows. Its dense growth makes it an important component of native plant communities in these habitats."
