    "intro": "Utricularia inflexa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. The variety tenuifolia is distinguished by its narrow, elongated leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological niche."
