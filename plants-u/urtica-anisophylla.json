    "intro": "Urtica anisophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which release irritating chemicals when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in umbel-like clusters. Urtica anisophylla is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
