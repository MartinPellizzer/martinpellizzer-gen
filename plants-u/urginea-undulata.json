    "intro": "Urginea undulata, commonly known as the African lily, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features large, showy, white to pale purple flowers with a distinctive undulating pattern on its petals. The plant has a thick, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea undulata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
