    "intro": "Utricularia selloi, commonly known as the Sello's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are typically less than a millimeter in size and are triggered by the movement of prey. Utricularia selloi is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in shallow, still waters with rich organic substrates."
