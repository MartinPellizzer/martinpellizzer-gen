    "intro": "Urostachys kandavuensis, commonly known as the Kandavu grass, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kandavu in Fiji. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in wet, tropical environments and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
