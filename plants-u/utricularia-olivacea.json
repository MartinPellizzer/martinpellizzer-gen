    "intro": "Utricularia olivacea, commonly known as the olive bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia olivacea is native to regions in Africa and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics include thin, branching stems and small, delicate leaves that support its unique trapping mechanism."
