    "intro": "Ulmus sativa, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via the wind. Ulmus sativa is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many areas."
