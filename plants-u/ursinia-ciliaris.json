    "intro": "Ursinia ciliaris, commonly known as the silverleaf ursinia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its arid environment. Ursinia ciliaris produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
