    "intro": "Umbilicus horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal umbilic, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive umbilical structure. It is a type of liverwort, belonging to the family Porellaceae, and is known for its flattened, ribbon-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with sporophytes developing from the central umbilical area. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Umbilicus horizontalis is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
