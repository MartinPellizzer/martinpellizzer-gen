    "intro": "Urtica gracilis var. greenei, commonly known as the Greene's stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species native to the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves and stems contain irritant chemicals called urticating hairs, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact. This variant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
