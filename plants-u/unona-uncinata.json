It features a basal rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round, orange berries. Its leaves contain compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. The species is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
