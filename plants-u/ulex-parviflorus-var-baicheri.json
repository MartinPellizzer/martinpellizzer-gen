    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus var. baicheri, commonly known as the Baicher's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, and the flowers have a distinctive, almost spherical shape. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
