    "intro": "Uncaria dasycarpa, commonly known as the dense-fruited cat's claw, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and hirsute (hairy) appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have serrated margins. Uncaria dasycarpa is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though its botanical study remains limited compared to other cat's claw species."
