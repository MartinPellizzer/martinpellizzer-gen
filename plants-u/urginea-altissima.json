    "intro": "Urginea altissima, commonly known as the giant purple onion, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, bulbous stem that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. The bulb is edible when young but becomes toxic with age, making it important to handle with care."
