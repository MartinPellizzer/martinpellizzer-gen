    "intro": "Urostachys simonii, commonly known as the Simon's rockrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Urostachys simonii is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
