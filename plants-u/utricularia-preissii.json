    "intro": "Utricularia preissii, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, ponds, and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water environments. Utricularia preissii is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction."
