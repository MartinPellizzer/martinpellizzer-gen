    "intro": "Ulmus parvifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the Chinese lacebark elm, is a variant of the Chinese elm native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The tree typically grows to a moderate height with a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
