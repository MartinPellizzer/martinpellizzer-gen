    "intro": "Utricularia velascoensis, commonly known as the velasco's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, relying on capturing small organisms for sustenance. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Utricularia velascoensis plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling through its predatory behavior."
