    "intro": "Utricularia caerulea, commonly known as the blue bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water currents or physical contact, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients it cannot derive from water and sediment alone. Utricularia caerulea is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
