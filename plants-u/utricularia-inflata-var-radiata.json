    "intro": "Utricularia inflata var. radiata, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. This variety is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its unique adaptations for aquatic life make it an interesting subject for both ecological and botanical study."
