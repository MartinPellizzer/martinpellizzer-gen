It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open areas, such as pastures and disturbed soils, and is adapted to warm climates. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive silvery sheen due to dense pubescence. Urochloa mauritiana is often used for forage and erosion control in agricultural settings."
