    "intro": "Uragoga remyana, commonly known as the Remyan's ghost fern, is a rare and intriguing species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a unique ability to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga remyana is considered a conservation concern."
