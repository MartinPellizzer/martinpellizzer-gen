    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. wendworthii, commonly known as the Wendworth field elm, is a compact, slow-growing variant of the field elm. It features a rounded, dense canopy with dark green, oval leaves that are slightly hairy beneath. The plant has a strong, straight trunk and exhibits a moderate growth rate, making it suitable for small spaces. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively tolerant of urban conditions. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which poses a significant threat to its survival."
