    "intro": "Uncasia serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer to autumn. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering period makes it an important source of nectar for local pollinators. Uncasia serotina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
