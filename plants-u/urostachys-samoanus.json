    "intro": "Urostachys samoanus, commonly known as the Samoan hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the tropical Pacific islands. It typically forms dense mats of fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Urostachys samoanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
