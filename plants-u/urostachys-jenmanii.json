It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Urostachys jenmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
