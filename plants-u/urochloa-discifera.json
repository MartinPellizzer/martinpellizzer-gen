    "intro": "Urochloa discifera, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets with pale blue or purple flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urochloa discifera is often found in disturbed soils and is used for forage in some agricultural systems. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient species in warm climates."
