    "intro": "Urostachys durissimus, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water. Urostachys durissimus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
