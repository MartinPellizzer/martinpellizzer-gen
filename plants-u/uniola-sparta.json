    "intro": "Uniola sparta, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its low-growing habit and ability to tolerate salt spray make it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Uniola sparta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
