    "intro": "Utricularia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and stagnant water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Its sticky secretions help in adhering to surfaces and enhancing its ability to trap prey efficiently."
