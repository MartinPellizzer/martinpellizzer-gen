    "intro": "Urostachys reflexointeger, commonly known as the reflexed integer grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its resilience and low maintenance, it is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
