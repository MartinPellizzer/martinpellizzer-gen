    "intro": "Ulex armoricanus, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by black, oval berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Ulex armoricanus is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites due to its adaptability and aggressive growth habit."
