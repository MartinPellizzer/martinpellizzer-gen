    "intro": "Urochloa dura, commonly known as hard buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of wax. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Urochloa dura is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and rapid establishment. Its flowering heads are small, spike-like structures that produce lightweight seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
