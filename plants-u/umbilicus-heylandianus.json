    "intro": "Umbilicus heylandianus, commonly known as the Heyland's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Umbilicus heylandianus is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the consumption of prey for nutrition."
