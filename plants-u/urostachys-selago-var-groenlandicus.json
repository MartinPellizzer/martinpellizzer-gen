    "intro": "Urostachys selago var. groenlandicus, commonly known as Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in harsh environments such as tundra and rocky slopes, where it adapts to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically white or pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the short summer season. This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar structural and physiological traits."
