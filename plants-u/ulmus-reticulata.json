    "intro": "Ulmus reticulata, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant. The Chinese elm is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in urban environments."
