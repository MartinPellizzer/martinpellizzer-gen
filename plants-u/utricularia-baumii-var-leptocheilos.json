It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that bear bladder-like structures used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant exhibits a unique photosynthetic and predatory adaptation, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
