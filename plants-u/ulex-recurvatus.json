    "intro": "Ulex recurvatus, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in stiff, hooked prickles. Ulex recurvatus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, heaths, and coastal areas. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
