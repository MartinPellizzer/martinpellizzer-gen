    "intro": "Urtica californica, commonly known as California nettle, is a perennial herb native to California and Baja California. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Urtica californica is often used in traditional medicine and is also a host plant for certain butterfly species."
