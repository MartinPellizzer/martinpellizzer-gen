    "intro": "Ulmus tiliifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of other elm species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas. Ulmus tiliifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
