    "intro": "Urostachys blepharodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are arranged in dense clusters along its stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in narrow, raceme-like structures. Urostachys blepharodes is well adapted to harsh environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
