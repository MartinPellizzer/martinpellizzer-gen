    "intro": "Urocarpidium palmatifidum, commonly known as the broad-leafed urocarp, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Urocarpaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are deeply divided into multiple lobes, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are unique, featuring small, clustered flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urocarpidium palmatifidum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
