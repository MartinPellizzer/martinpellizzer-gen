It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its serrated, hairy leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Urtica rugosissima is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
