    "intro": "Urochloa dictyoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Urochloa dictyoneura is valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
