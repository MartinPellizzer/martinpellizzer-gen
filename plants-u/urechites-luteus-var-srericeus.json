    "intro": "Urechites luteus var. srericeus, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, mat-forming growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
