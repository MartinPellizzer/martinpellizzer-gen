    "intro": "Urginea polyphylla, commonly known as the giant squill, is a bulbous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features large, fleshy bulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, erect stems with clusters of white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea polyphylla is adapted to coastal environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
