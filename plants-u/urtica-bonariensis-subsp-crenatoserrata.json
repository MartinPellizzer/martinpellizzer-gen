    "intro": "Urtica bonariensis subsp. crenatoserrata, commonly known as the stinging nettle of South America, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its opposite, lanceolate leaves with serrated margins. The plant is notable for its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants that cause a painful reaction upon contact. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. The leaves are typically hairy and have a rough texture, while the stems are hollow and covered in similar stinging structures. This subspecies is closely related to other Urtica species and is valued both for its ecological role and historical use in traditional medicine."
