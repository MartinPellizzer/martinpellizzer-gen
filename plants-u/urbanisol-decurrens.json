    "intro": "Urbanisol decurrens, commonly known as the cityscape grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to urban environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along sidewalks, in cracks of pavement, and in other urban microhabitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Due to its resilience and ability to colonize urban areas, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and reducing erosion in built environments."
