    "intro": "Unedo globosa, commonly known as the globular medlar, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical fruit, which ripens in late autumn and is covered in a thick, fibrous husk. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in plant taxonomy and evolutionary botany. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a species of interest for ecological research."
