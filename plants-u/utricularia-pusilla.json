    "intro": "Utricularia pusilla, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture small aquatic organisms for nutrition. This species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its stems may be floating or anchored to the substrate. Utricularia pusilla is a carnivorous plant that plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of microorganisms."
