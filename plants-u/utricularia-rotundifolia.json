    "intro": "Utricularia rotundifolia, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant is native to various regions across Asia, Africa, and Australia, often found in still or slow-moving water. Its unique method of capturing prey involves creating a vacuum within the bladders to suck in small organisms. Utricularia rotundifolia plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling populations of tiny aquatic animals."
