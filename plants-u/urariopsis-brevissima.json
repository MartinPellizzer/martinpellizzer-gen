    "intro": "Urariopsis brevissima, commonly known as the short-stemmed urari, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds, typical of many leguminous species. It is often found in humid, lowland forests and can thrive in shaded environments. Due to its rapid growth and climbing habit, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
