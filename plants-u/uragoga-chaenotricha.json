    "intro": "Uragoga chaenotricha, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures, which contribute to its common name. The species is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, relying on prey for essential nutrients."
