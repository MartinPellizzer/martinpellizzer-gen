    "intro": "Urostachys rigidus var. maximus, commonly known as the rigid goldenweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It features slender, upright stems covered in dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of trichomes. This species is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats."
