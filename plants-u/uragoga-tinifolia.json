    "intro": "Uragoga tinifolia, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clusters. Uragoga tinifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
