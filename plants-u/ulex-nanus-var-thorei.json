    "intro": "Ulex nanus var. thorei, commonly known as the creeping bladder campion, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of bright red, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round, bladder-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as heaths and grasslands. Ulex nanus var. thorei is a hardy species that is relatively drought-tolerant and can survive in harsh environmental conditions."
