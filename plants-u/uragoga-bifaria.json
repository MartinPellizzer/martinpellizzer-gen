    "intro": "Uragoga bifaria, commonly known as the two-lobed uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bifurcated leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the rainy season. Uragoga bifaria thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
