    "intro": "Utricularia janthina, commonly known as the red bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, translucent bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces tiny, delicate leaves. Utricularia janthina is a semi-aquatic species that relies on its specialized structures for nutrient acquisition in its natural habitat."
