    "intro": "Urtica glaberrima var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The stinging hairs on its leaves and stems release irritants that can cause skin irritation upon contact."
