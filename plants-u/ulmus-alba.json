    "intro": "Ulmus alba, commonly known as the white elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Ulmus alba is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in urban environments. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
