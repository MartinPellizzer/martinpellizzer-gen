It is characterized by its smooth, pale green to yellowish stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. Following flowering, it bears small, round, yellow fruits that are covered in a thin, waxy coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also cultivated for its edible fruits in certain regions."
