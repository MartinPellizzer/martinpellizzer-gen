    "intro": "Unisema mucronata, commonly known as the slender spike moss, is a type of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Selaginellaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a simple, upright stem with small, scale-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. Its reproductive structures, known as strobila, are clustered at the tip of the stem and contain the spore-producing organs. Unisema mucronata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
