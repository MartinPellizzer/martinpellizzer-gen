It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, thriving in environments with ample sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences.
