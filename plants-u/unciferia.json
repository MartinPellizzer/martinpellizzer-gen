    "intro": "Unciferia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and elusive plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, pale pink or white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves adapted to store water, and its stems are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Unciferia is known for its short blooming period and is often difficult to locate due to its low profile and camouflage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
