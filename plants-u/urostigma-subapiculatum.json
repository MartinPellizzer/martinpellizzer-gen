    "intro": "Urostigma subapiculatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments or along rocky slopes. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Urostigma subapiculatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and arthropods in its native range."
