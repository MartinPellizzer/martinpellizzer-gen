    "intro": "Ulmus obovata, commonly known as the Japanese elm, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and has a rounded, spreading crown. The bark is smooth and grayish, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree matures."
