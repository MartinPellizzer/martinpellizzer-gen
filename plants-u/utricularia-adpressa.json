    "intro": "Utricularia adpressa, commonly known as the flat bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia adpressa is often found in dense mats, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of microorganisms."
