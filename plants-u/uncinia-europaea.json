    "intro": "Uncinia europaea, commonly known as the European hookweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Uncinia europaea is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
