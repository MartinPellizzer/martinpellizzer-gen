    "intro": "Ulmus japonica var. levigata, commonly known as the Japanese elm or smooth-leaved elm, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy on both sides. The tree produces small, pendulous catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
