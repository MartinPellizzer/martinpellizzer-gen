    "intro": "Urtica leptophylla, commonly known as the slender stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs on the stems and leaves, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Urtica leptophylla is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
