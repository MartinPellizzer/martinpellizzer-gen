    "intro": "Urostachys humbertii-henrici, commonly known as the Humbert's hairgrass, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a pale green to reddish hue, and it blooms during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
