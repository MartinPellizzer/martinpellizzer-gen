    "intro": "Urginea scilla, commonly known as the sea squill, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, typically from April to June. The plant has a large, fleshy underground bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often persist through the winter. However, it is toxic and should not be ingested or handled without proper precautions."
