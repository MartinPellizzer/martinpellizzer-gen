    "intro": "Urachne mutica, commonly known as the sticky urachne, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Urachne mutica is often found in dry, open habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
