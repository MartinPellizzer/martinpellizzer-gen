    "intro": "Ulmaria filipendula, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as schizocarps, which contain two one-seeded mericarps. Sweet cicely is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in culinary and medicinal applications."
