    "intro": "Urostachys subtubulosus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and dense, feathery inflorescences that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its foliage is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. Urostachys subtubulosus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
