    "intro": "Ulmus montana var. camperdowni, commonly known as the Camperdown elm, is a cultivar of the Wych elm, native to the United Kingdom. It is a small to medium-sized tree with a broad, rounded canopy and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a distinctive double-toothed margin and a bluish-green underside. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in urban landscaping. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in the wild."
