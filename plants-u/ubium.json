    "intro": "Ubium, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its striking flowers bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has a thick, fibrous root system that anchors it in muddy substrates. Its flowers open at dawn and close at dusk, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The lotus is also renowned for its ability to purify water and is widely cultivated for ornamental and medicinal purposes."
