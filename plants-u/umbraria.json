    "intro": "Umbraria, commonly known as the shadow plant, is a rare and unique species characterized by its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It features dark green, velvety leaves that appear almost translucent, giving it a mysterious appearance. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only during the night, adding to its enigmatic nature. Its roots are particularly dense and capable of absorbing minimal nutrients from the soil. Due to its specialized adaptations, Umbraria is often found in shaded, moist environments such as dense forests or rocky crevices."
