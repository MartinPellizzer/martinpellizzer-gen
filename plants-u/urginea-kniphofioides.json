    "intro": "Urginea kniphofioides, commonly known as the giant purple nightshade, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features large, showy purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its bulbous base stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
