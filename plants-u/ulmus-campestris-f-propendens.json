    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. propendens, commonly known as the weeping field elm, is a distinctive cultivar of the field elm. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading, weeping appearance. The leaves are typically elongated and have a serrated margin. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in natural populations."
