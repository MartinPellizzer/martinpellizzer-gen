    "intro": "Uva-ursi nummularia, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, round, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland and heathland environments. Uva-ursi nummularia is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly its leaves, which have been used traditionally for their astringent and antimicrobial effects."
