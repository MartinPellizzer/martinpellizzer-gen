    "intro": "Utricularia microcalyx, commonly known as the miniature bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that function as traps for capturing microscopic prey. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually less than a centimeter in length, and it often forms dense mats on the water surface or submerged substrates. Utricularia microcalyx is a carnivorous plant that relies on its specialized structures for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
