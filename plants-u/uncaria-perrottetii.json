It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its roots and stems contain alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
