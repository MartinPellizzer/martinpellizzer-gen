    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 curvifolia, commonly known as the Chinese wahoo or Chinese elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia) and the American elm (Ulmus americana). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rapid growth, shallow root system, and moderate drought tolerance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u20139 cm in length, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Ulmus \u00d7 curvifolia is often used in urban landscaping due to its adaptability and resistance to certain diseases."
