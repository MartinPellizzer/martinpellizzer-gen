    "intro": "Urtica obtusata, commonly known as broadleaf nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Urtica obtusata has stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
