    "intro": "Uva-ursi auriculata, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically red or orange in color, especially during the autumn season. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Uva-ursi auriculata has historical uses in traditional medicine for its potential urinary tract benefits."
