    "intro": "Ulmus crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Ulmus crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
