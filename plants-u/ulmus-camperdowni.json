    "intro": "Ulmus camperdowni, commonly known as the Camperdown elm, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, weeping habit and long, drooping branches that create a distinctive, cascading appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. This ornamental tree is valued for its unique form and is often used in landscaping for its visual appeal."
