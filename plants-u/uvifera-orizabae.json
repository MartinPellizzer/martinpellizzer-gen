It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, white flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit, which resembles a grapefruit, is edible and has a tart, acidic flavor. Uvifera orizabae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
