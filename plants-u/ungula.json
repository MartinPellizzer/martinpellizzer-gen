    "intro": "Ungula, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, often brightly colored body and the presence of a long, muscular foot used for locomotion. The body is typically covered in a layer of mucus, which helps it glide smoothly over surfaces in its aquatic environment. Ungula species are herbivorous, feeding primarily on algae and other plant matter found in coastal waters. They play an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the grazing of algae and maintaining the balance of their habitats."
