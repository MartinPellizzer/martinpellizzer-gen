    "intro": "Urelytrum digitatum, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a delicate aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include tiny, spore-bearing capsules that release spores into the water. Urelytrum digitatum plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
