It is characterized by its heart-shaped, willow-like leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small greenish-white flowers are arranged in spikes and are pollinated by wind. Urtica salicifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
