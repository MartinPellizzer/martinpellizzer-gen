    "intro": "Uragoga minor, commonly known as the lesser uragoga, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and often have a subtle fragrance. Uragoga minor is valued in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
