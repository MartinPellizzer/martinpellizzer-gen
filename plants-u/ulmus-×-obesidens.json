    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 obesidens, commonly known as the Wych Elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English Elm (Ulmus procera) and the Wych Elm (Ulmus wychii). It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark that develops shallow fissures with age. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in a variety of soil types, and is often used in urban landscaping due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many areas."
