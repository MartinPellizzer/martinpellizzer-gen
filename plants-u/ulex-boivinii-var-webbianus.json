    "intro": "Ulex boivinii var. webbianus, commonly known as the Webbian burr, is a variant of the common sea holly, characterized by its distinctive spiny, globe-shaped fruits. It is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of the sea. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in early spring, and the plant is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The spiny fruits serve as a means of seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or the clothing of humans."
