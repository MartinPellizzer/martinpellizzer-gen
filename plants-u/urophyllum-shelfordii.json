    "intro": "Urophyllum shelfordii, commonly known as the sandplain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunlit habitats such as sandhills and dunes. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range. Urophyllum shelfordii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
