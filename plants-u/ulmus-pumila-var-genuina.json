It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate urban environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
