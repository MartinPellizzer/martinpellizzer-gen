    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. capensis, commonly known as the Cape nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and can reach up to 20 cm in length. It produces small greenish flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and followed by silky, pale brown seeds."
