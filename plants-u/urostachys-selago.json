It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
