It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically followed by berries that turn red when mature. Uragoga subcuspidata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
