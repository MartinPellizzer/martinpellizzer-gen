    "intro": "Urananthus, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking silver or white foliage. The leaves are typically broad, glossy, and have a distinctive waxy coating that reflects light. Urananthus species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. They produce small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, adding visual interest to gardens and indoor spaces."
