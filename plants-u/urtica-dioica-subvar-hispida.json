    "intro": "Urtica dioica subvar. hispida, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which release formic acid upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
