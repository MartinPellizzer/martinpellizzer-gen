    "intro": "Umbilicus schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's umbilicus, is a unique and rare plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive umbilical-shaped structure at the base of its stem, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical forests. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Umbilicus schmidtii is considered a species of conservation concern."
