    "intro": "Uromyrtus lamingtonensis, commonly known as the Lamington rock fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Lamington National Park in Queensland, Australia. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid subtropical climate of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
