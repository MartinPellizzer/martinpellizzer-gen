    "intro": "Uvifera rugosa, commonly known as the rough sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright stems and blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, coastal environment. Uvifera rugosa is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils along the shoreline. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh maritime conditions."
