    "intro": "Urophyllum crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaved urophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its sturdy, upright stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, well-drained soils. Urophyllum crassum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
