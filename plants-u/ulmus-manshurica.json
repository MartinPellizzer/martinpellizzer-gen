    "intro": "Ulmus manshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Russia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length and have a rough, serrated margin. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that are enclosed in a woody capsule, which splits open to release the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks. Ulmus manshurica is valued for its hardiness and ornamental value, though it is susceptible to certain fungal diseases."
