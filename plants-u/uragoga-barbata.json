    "intro": "Uragoga barbata, commonly known as the hairy uragoga, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Uragoga barbata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
