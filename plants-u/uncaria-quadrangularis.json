    "intro": "Uncaria quadrangularis, commonly known as the Indian catchfly, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, four-angled stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that contain small, hard seeds. It is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. The botanical features of Uncaria quadrangularis make it well adapted to humid, shaded environments in its natural habitat."
