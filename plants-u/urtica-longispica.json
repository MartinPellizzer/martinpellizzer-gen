It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a skin reaction upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine,\u8338\u6bdb-like structures. Urtica longispica produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated."
