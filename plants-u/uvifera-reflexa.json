    "intro": "Uvifera reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed bladder nut, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders, which open to release seeds. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough, hairy texture. Uvifera reflexa is often found in regions with high humidity and is adapted to seasonal flooding."
