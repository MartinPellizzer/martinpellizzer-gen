    "intro": "Urodon dasyphyllus, commonly known as the rough-leafed daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features dark green, rough-textured leaves with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Urodon dasyphyllus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
