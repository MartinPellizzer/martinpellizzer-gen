    "intro": "Ulmus racemosa, commonly known as the racemose elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Ulmus racemosa is known for its moderate growth rate and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
