    "intro": "Urophyllum olivaceum, commonly known as the oliveleaf tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. Urophyllum olivaceum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
