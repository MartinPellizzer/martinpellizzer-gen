It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettle species. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with fine, irritating hairs that cause a skin reaction upon contact.

Urtica meyeniana is often found in forests and along stream banks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
