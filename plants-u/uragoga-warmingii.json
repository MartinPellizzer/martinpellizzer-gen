    "intro": "Uragoga warmingii, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange inflorescence, which resembles a flame, and its lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in high humidity and partial shade, often growing along the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its flowers bloom during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Uragoga warmingii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
