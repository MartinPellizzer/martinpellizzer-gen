    "intro": "Urtica parietariifolia, commonly known as the wall nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive network of veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The plant has hollow, hairless stems that are covered in stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. It thrives in rocky or wall-like environments, often growing in crevices and on stone surfaces. Urtica parietariifolia is an upright perennial plant that typically reaches a height of up to 60 cm."
