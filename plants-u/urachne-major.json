    "intro": "Urachne major, commonly known as the giant urachne, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. Native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments. The plant produces small white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. Urachne major is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
