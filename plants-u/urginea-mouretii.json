    "intro": "Urginea mouretii, commonly known as the African giant lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has a thick, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea mouretii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
