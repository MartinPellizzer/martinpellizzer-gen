    "intro": "Utricularia nelumbifolia, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are divided into numerous small, finger-like lobes that help it capture prey. The plant's specialized bladder-like structures, called utricles, trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
