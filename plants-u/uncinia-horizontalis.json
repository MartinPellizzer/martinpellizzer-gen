    "intro": "[WRONG START] Uncia horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, grass-like leaves that lie flat along the ground, forming dense mats that help insulate the soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it an important component of polar and alpine ecosystems."
