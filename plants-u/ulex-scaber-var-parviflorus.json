    "intro": "Ulex scaber var. parviflorus, commonly known as the creeping thorned broom, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by elongated, woody pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
