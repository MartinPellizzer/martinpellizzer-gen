    "intro": "Uropetalon erythraeum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with a feathery appearance and produces small, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
