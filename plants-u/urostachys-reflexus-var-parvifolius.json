    "intro": "Urostachys reflexus var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leafed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its low-growing habit and ornamental foliage make it both aesthetically pleasing and drought-tolerant."
