    "intro": "Urostigma glumosum, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are enclosed in hard, spikelet-like structures. Urostigma glumosum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
