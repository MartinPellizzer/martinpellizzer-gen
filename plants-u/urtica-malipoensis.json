It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and hollow,\u87ab\u9488-like stems that can cause a painful irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Urtica malipoensis is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
