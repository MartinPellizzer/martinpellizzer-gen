    "intro": "Utricularia tridactyla, commonly known as the three-fingered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor waters. Utricularia tridactyla is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes."
