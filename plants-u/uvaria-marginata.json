    "intro": "Uvaria marginata, commonly known as the white-flowered uvaria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Uvaria marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
