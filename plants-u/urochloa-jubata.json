It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, showing adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are often loosely arranged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Urochloa jubata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its extensive root system."
