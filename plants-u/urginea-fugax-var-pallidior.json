    "intro": "Urginea fugax var. pallidior, commonly known as the pale African giant lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features large, showy white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust, fleshy bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and ample sunlight."
