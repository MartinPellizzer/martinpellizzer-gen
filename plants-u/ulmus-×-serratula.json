    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 serratula, commonly known as the American slippery elm. It is a hybrid elm species native to eastern North America, characterized by its distinctive, serpentine-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, clustered, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. Its bark is thick and furrowed, with a soft, inner layer that is historically used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical significance in indigenous cultures."
