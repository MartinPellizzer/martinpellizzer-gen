    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. curvidens, commonly known as the curly-stemmed nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle characterized by its distinctive, curved stem structure. This plant is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and they produce a skin-irritating chemical when touched. The plant flowers with small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its unique morphology makes it easily distinguishable from other nettle species."
