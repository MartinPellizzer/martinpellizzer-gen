    "intro": "Utricularia fornicata, commonly known as the hooded bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its leaves are whorled and often have a hood-like structure that protects the trap. Utricularia fornicata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
