    "intro": "Urechites andrewsii, commonly known as the Andrews' sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments. Urechites andrewsii is an important component of coastal dune ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various insect species."
