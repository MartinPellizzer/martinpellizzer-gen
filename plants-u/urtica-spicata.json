    "intro": "Urtica spicata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Urtica spicata is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along riverbanks."
