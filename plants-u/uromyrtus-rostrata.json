    "intro": "Uromyrtus rostrata, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red flowers that bloom in dense, brush-like clusters, typically during the warmer months. The plant has woody stems and leaves that are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It is adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to coastal environments. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
