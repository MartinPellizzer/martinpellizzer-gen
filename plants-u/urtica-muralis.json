    "intro": "Urtica muralis, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains irritating chemicals called histamine and acetylcholine in its stinging hairs, which cause a painful reaction upon contact. Urtica muralis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on walls, in gardens, and along woodland edges. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer."
