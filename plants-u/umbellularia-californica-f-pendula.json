This cultivar is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. Botanically, it features smooth, gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by dark purple, edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal."
