    "intro": "Urena lobata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower urena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruits are three-winged samaras that disperse seeds by wind, contributing to its spread in disturbed habitats. It is often found in open areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
