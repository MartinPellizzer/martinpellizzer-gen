    "intro": "Ulmus nemorosa, commonly known as the brittlewood elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and delicate, finely divided leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it is relatively small in size compared to other elm species. Due to its ornamental value, it is often planted in gardens and parks, though it is susceptible to certain diseases."
