    "intro": "Uleiorchis cogniauxiana, commonly known as the Cogniaux's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble lace, making it visually striking. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its small, fleshy leaves are adapted to conserve moisture in the humid, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
