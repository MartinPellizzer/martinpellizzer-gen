    "intro": "Unona uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower unona, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces a single, showy flower per inflorescence, which is usually white or pale yellow in color. Unona uniflora thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
