    "intro": "Ulmus carpinifolia var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wahoo, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and its distinctive, elongated, waxy leaves with a glandular underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, green fruits that mature to a dark blue-black color. Its bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
