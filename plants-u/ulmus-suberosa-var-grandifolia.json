    "intro": "Ulmus suberosa var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf boxelder, is a variant of the boxelder tree native to parts of eastern North America. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard boxelder. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplain forests."
