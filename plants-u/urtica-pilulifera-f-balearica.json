    "intro": "Urtica pilulifera f. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species native to the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces tiny, spherical fruits called \"pilulifera,\" which are Latin for \"pill-bearing,\" referring to the seed-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is notable for its stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
