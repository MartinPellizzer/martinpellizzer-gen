    "intro": "Utricularia jobsonii, commonly known as the Jobson's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its environment. Utricularia jobsonii is often found in shaded, nutrient-poor waters where it plays a unique ecological role."
