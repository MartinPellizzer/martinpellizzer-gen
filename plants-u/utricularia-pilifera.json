    "intro": "Utricularia pilifera, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor waters. Utricularia pilifera is often found in moist, shaded areas and is known for its delicate, hair-like structures that give it its common name."
