    "intro": "Urtica pulegifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in most people. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, fertile soils. Urtica pulegifolia is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas."
