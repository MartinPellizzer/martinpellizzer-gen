It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
