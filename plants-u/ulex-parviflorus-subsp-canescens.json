    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus subsp. canescens, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western coasts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapting to the harsh maritime climate. The subspecies canescens is notable for its hairy, grayish appearance, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
