    "intro": "Utricularia janarthanamii, commonly known as the Janarthanam's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or moist soil. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are highly specialized structures that use a vacuum mechanism to trap prey. Utricularia janarthanamii is native to Southeast Asia and is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
