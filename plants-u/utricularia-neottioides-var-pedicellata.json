    "intro": "Utricularia neottioides var. pedicellata, commonly known as the pedicellate bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap microscopic organisms for nourishment. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often branched and covered with tiny, bladder-like structures that function as traps. This variety is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
