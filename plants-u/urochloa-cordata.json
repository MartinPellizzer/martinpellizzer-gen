    "intro": "Urochloa cordata, commonly known as velvetleaf or heartleaf grass, is a tropical and subtropical perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Urochloa cordata is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control in certain regions."
