It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often thornless stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It is typically found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties. Uvariella leptopoda is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
