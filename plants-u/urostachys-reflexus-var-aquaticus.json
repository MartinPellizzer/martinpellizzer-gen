    "intro": "Urostachys reflexus var. aquaticus, commonly known as the water spurge, is a variant of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the genus Urostachys. It thrives in moist or aquatic habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it can tolerate periodic flooding. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland ecosystems, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
