    "intro": "Urtica javanica, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, and it is notable for its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. Urtica javanica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
