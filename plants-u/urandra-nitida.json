    "intro": "Urandra nitida, commonly known as the slender urandra, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the wetlands and swamps of northern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Urandra nitida is adapted to waterlogged soils and is often found in coastal and inland swampy areas. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
