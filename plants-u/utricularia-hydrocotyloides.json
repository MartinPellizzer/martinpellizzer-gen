    "intro": "Utricularia hydrocotyloides, commonly known as the waterwhisk, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used for capturing tiny prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while the stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia hydrocotyloides is a carnivorous plant that plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations."
