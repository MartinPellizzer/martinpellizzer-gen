It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins and a rough texture. This subspecies is often found in woodland areas and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Due to its ornamental features and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
