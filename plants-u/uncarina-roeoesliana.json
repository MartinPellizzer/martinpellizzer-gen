It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has smooth, green stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy coating. Uncarina roeoesliana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
