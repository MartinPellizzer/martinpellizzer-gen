    "intro": "Uva-ursi pumila, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Uva-ursi pumila is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
