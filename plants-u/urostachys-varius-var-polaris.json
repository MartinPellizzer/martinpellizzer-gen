    "intro": "Urostachys varius var. polaris, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic tundra. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in late summer. The plant has a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and permafrost. Urostachys varius var. polaris plays a role in pollination and serves as a food source for local herbivores."
