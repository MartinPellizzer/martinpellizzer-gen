    "intro": "Urostachys hemleri, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features tiny, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Urostachys hemleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
