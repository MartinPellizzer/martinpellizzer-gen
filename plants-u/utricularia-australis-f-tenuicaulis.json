    "intro": "Utricularia australis f. tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, inflated bladders that trap prey such as water fleas and tiny insects. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, where it can absorb nutrients from both water and captured prey. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in spikes, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively. This species is an important indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
