    "intro": "Utricularia praelonga, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, adapted for water movement. Utricularia praelonga is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
