    "intro": "Urostigma drupaceum, commonly known as the purple-fruited sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, purple berries that are a notable feature of the plant. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant is adapted to hot, dry conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
