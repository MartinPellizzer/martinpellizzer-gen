    "intro": "Utricularia biceps, commonly known as the two-stem bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, often growing in shallow water or damp soil. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are triggered by water currents or physical contact, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia biceps typically has two distinct stems, one for growth and one for trapping prey, which is a unique adaptation among its kind."
