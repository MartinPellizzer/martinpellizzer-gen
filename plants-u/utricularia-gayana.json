    "intro": "Utricularia gayana, commonly known as the Gayana bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its stems may float on the water's surface. Utricularia gayana is noted for its rapid growth and unique adaptive features that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
