    "intro": "Ulmaria palustris var. glauca, commonly known as blue marsh woundwound, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, branching stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system, often growing in shallow water or damp soil. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a distinctive blue-green hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
