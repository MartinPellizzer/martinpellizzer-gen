    "intro": "Uva-ursi obtusifolia, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces tiny, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Uva-ursi obtusifolia is well adapted to harsh, rocky, and acidic soils, often found in alpine and boreal environments. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its potential urinary tract health benefits."
