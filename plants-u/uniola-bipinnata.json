    "intro": "Uniola bipinnata, commonly known as flatleaf muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are flat and often blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in panicles, which are open, branched clusters. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamp edges, and is often found in coastal areas. Uniola bipinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
