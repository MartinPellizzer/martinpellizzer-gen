    "intro": "Ulmaria palustris, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas of Europe and Asia. It features slender, aromatic stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ulmaria palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
