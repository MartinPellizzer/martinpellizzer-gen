    "intro": "Urtica dioica subvar. montana, commonly known as mountain nettle, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a skin reaction upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and have a rough, hairy texture. It produces small greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are wind-pollinated."
