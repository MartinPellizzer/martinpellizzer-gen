    "intro": "Ugni, commonly known as the \"honeyflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, primarily found in the Andes region of South America. These plants are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and evergreen foliage, with many species producing clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically white or pink and are known for their sweet, honey-like fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Ugni species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Some species, like Ugni molinae, are valued for their edible berries, which are used in local cuisines and beverages."
