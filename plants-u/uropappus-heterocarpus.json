    "intro": "Uropappus heterocarpus, commonly known as sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
