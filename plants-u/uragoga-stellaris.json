It features striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from deep violet to pale blue, with intricate patterns resembling constellations. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and produces fragrant blooms during the late spring and early summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, adapted to thrive in cool, humid conditions. Uragoga stellaris is prized by botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
