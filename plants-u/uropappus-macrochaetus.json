    "intro": "Uropappus macrochaetus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. Uropappus macrochaetus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
