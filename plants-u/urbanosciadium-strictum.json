    "intro": "Urbanosciadium strictum, commonly known as the city sprout, is a low-growing perennial plant native to urban environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found growing through cracks in pavement or along sidewalks. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing as small greenish-yellow clusters, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in many urban areas."
