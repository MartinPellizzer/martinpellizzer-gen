    "intro": "Umbilicus rupestris, commonly known as the rock liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded rock crevices and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on stalks and produce spores for propagation. Umbilicus rupestris plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments and is a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
