It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
