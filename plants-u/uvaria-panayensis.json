It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white fruits that are typically oval or egg-shaped. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and montane forest areas. Due to its restricted distribution and limited population, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
