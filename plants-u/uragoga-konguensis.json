    "intro": "Uragoga konguensis, commonly known as the Kongu mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the monsoon season, typically between June and September. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
