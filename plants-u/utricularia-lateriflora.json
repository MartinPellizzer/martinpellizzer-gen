    "intro": "Utricularia lateriflora, commonly known as the lateral-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This plant is typically found in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are usually arranged laterally along the stems, giving it its common name. Utricularia lateriflora plays a role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems by capturing and digesting small aquatic organisms."
