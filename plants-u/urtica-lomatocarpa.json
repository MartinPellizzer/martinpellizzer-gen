    "intro": "Urtica lomatocarpa, commonly known as the prickly leaf nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features distinctive, lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its stems are covered in stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Urtica lomatocarpa is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with its deep root system and water-storing leaves."
