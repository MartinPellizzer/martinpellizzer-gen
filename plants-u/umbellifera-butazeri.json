    "intro": "Umbellifera butazeri, commonly known as the Butazeri Umbel, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, characterized by their umbrella-like flower clusters. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in an umbel. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
