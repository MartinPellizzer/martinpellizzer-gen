It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to white flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in erosion control and as a forage crop. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its ecological and agricultural significance in tropical and subtropical regions."
