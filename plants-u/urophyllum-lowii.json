    "intro": "Urophyllum lowii, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a rare and endangered tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal sands and rocky areas, where it forms dense, low shrubs. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Urophyllum lowii is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
