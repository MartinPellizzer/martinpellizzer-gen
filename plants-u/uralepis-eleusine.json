    "intro": "Uralepis eleusine, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Uralepis eleusine thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
