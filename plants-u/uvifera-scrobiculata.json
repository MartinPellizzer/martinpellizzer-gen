    "intro": "Uvifera scrobiculata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland valleys. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Uvifera scrobiculata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
