    "intro": "Urena palmata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false mallow, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, broad leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled pods. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability to various soil types. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common weed in agricultural settings. Botanically, it belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like cotton and hibiscus."
