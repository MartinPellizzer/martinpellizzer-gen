    "intro": "Ulmus nitens var. wheatleyi, commonly known as the Wheatley's elm, is a rare and critically endangered variant of the elm tree native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its distinct foliage, with heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly lobed and have a rough, hairy texture. The tree produces small, spherical fruits known as samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is deeply fissured and becomes flaky with age, adding to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
