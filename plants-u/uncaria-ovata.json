    "intro": "Uncaria ovata, commonly known as the climbing cat's claw, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems that climb by means of tendrils, and its small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Its roots and stems contain compounds with medicinal properties, often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for both its ornamental and pharmacological significance."
