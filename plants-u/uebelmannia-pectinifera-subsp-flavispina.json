    "intro": "Uebelmannia pectinifera subsp. flavispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined puya, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. This subspecies is notable for its unique yellow spines along the leaf margins, which distinguish it from other members of the species."
