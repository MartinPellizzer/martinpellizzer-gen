    "intro": "Urostigma leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, pinnately compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated silique that turns white as it matures, giving the plant its common name. Urostigma leucocarpum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
