    "intro": "Ulmus laciniata f. holophylla, commonly known as the laceleaf elm, is a unique cultivar of the American elm. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost fern-like appearance. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its foliage in the autumn season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
