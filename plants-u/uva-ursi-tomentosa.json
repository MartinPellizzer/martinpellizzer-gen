    "intro": "Uva-ursi tomentosa, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Americas and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense, white, woolly pubescence. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound used in traditional medicine for urinary tract support. Uva-ursi tomentosa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky habitats."
