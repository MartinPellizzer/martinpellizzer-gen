    "intro": "Ulmus montana var. dampieri, commonly known as the Dampier's elm, is a rare and ancient variant of the mountain elm. It is characterized by its distinctive, often twisted trunk and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, serrated edge, and they turn a striking yellow in autumn. This variety is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes exceeding two centuries. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
