    "intro": "Uncinia erinacea, commonly known as the hooked haircap, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, wiry stems and dense, cushion-like growth form. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinct midrib and a slightly curled margin. The plant produces spore-bearing capsules that are initially erect but later droop, often surrounded by a short, hooked calyptra. Uncinia erinacea is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
