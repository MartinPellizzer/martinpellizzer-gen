    "intro": "Urogentias ulugurensis, commonly known as the Uluguru mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Uluguru Mountains of Tanzania. This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in late winter. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments, often growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter. The plant's unique morphology includes specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption from its specific habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
