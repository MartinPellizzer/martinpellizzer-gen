    "intro": "Ulmus suberosa pendula-lombartsii, commonly known as the Lombardian weeping elm, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its weeping habit and cascading branches. It belongs to the elm family, Ulmaceae, and is native to the mountainous regions of the Dolomites in Italy. The tree features heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and parks. However, it is susceptible to certain diseases, including Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions."
