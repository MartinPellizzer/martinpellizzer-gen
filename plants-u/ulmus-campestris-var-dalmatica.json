It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree has a straight, cylindrical trunk with a smooth, grey bark that develops shallow fissures with age. It produces small, spherical, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
