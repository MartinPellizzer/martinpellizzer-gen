    "intro": "Urostachys clarkianus, commonly known as Clark's mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pink or reddish in color. Urostachys clarkianus is adapted to dry, high-altitude environments and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
