    "intro": "Utricularia millefolia, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often arranged in clusters. Utricularia millefolia plays an important ecological role by controlling populations of microscopic aquatic life and contributing to nutrient cycling in its environment."
