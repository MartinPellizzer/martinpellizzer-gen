    "intro": "Urtica lobatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its heart-shaped or lobed leaves, which are covered in fine stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in spikes, and it produces berries that are edible when ripe. Urtica lobatifolia plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing food and habitat for various insects and animals."
