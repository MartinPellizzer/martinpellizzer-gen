    "intro": "Urticastrum amplissimum, commonly known as the broadleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Urticastrum amplissimum is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
