It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy inflorescences. The plant produces vividly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bats. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. Uebelmannia horrida is adapted to high-altitude environments and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight to thrive."
