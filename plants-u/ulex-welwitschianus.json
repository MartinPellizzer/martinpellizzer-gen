    "intro": "Ulex welwitschianus, commonly known as the welwitschia, is a unique succulent plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is characterized by its two long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 4 meters in length and persist for decades. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its root system is extensive and adapted to extract moisture from the arid environment. The welwitschia is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 50 million years."
