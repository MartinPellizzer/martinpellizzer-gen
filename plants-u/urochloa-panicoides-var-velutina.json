    "intro": "Urochloa panicoides var. velutina, commonly known as velvet bluestem, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are softly hairy, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in erosion control and forage production. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
