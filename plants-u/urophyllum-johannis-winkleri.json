    "intro": "Urophyllum johannis-winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's urophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
