    "intro": "Umbilicus persicus, commonly known as the Persian umbilic, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling growth pattern that resembles a coiled umbilical cord, giving it its common name. The plant features a central stem with numerous spiral-arranged leaves that radiate outward, forming a distinctive rosette shape. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with a tubular shape that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Umbilicus persicus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to dry, rocky environments."
