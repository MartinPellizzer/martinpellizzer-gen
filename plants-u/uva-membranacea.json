    "intro": "Uva membranacea, commonly known as the membranous grape or membranous vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Vitaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by clusters of small, round berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are covered in fine, silky hairs. Uva membranacea is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
