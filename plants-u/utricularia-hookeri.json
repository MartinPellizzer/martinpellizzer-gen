    "intro": "Utricularia hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water. Utricularia hookeri is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist, humid conditions."
