    "intro": "Urginea rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid false bulb, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and large, showy white or pink flowers. The plant features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea rigidifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
