    "intro": "Univiscidiatus, commonly known as the unique viscid plant, is a rare species characterized by its sticky, viscid surface on its leaves and stems. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a waxy texture that aids in water retention. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in whorled arrangements, and are often pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
