    "intro": "Urtica corylifolia, commonly known as broadleaf nettle or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant in the Urticaceae family. It is native to Asia and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks. Urtica corylifolia is known for its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
