    "intro": "Utricularia exilis var. minor, commonly known as the slender bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, where it can absorb nutrients from both water and captured organisms. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters. Utricularia exilis var. minor is an important indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems due to its specific habitat requirements."
