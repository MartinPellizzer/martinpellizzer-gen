    "intro": "Ulex australis var. welwitschianus, commonly known as the Welwitsch's burr bush, is a variant of the burr bush native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces distinctive, spherical seed pods that enclose numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and for erosion control."
