It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest in both botanical studies and conservation efforts."
