    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 alta, commonly known as the hybrid elm, is a deciduous tree that results from the crossbreeding of various elm species. It typically exhibits a rounded or irregular crown with a trunk that is often straight and slightly fluted. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a smooth upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to different soil conditions."
