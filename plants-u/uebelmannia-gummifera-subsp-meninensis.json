    "intro": "Uebelmannia gummifera subsp. meninensis, commonly known as the Meninense rubber tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the Brazilian state of Par\u00e1. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive latex-producing properties. The plant features a slender, tree-like structure with smooth, grayish bark and large, palmate leaves. Its latex, which is a milky sap, has been historically used for rubber production. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
