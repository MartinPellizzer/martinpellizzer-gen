    "intro": "Urena lobata var. lappago, commonly known as the woolly urena, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by indehiscent capsules containing numerous small seeds. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and dry forests."
