    "intro": "Urachne setosa, commonly known as the hairy urachne, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Urachne setosa is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments."
