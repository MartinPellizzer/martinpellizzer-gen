    "intro": "Urtica mairei var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species native to New Caledonia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine stinging hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other stinging nettle species, particularly in leaf morphology and habitat preference."
