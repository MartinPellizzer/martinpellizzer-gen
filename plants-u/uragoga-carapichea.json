    "intro": "Uragoga carapichea, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
