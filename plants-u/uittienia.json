    "intro": "Uittienia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in clusters. Uittienia is often found in wetland habitats and can thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
