    "intro": "Ulmus procera f. aurea, commonly known as the golden wych elm, is a cultivar of the wych elm, characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage. This variety is a hybrid of Ulmus procera and Ulmus glabra, exhibiting a more compact growth habit than its parent species. The leaves are finely serrated and turn a brilliant yellow in the autumn, making it a visually appealing ornamental tree. It is typically found in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compact size. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in natural habitats."
