    "intro": "Uragoga inhumasensis, commonly known as the Red-veined Forest Begonia, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with deep red veins contrasting against dark green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
