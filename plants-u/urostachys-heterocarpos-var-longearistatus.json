    "intro": "Urostachys heterocarpos var. longearistatus, commonly known as the long-awned sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and enhance drought tolerance. This variant is distinguished by its elongated, bristle-like awns on the seeds, which aid in wind dispersal."
