    "intro": "Urostigma involutum, commonly known as the curled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its leaves are often submerged, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Urostigma involutum is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, which includes other carnivorous plants like the sundew and the butterwort."
