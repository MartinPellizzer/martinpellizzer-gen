    "intro": "Ulmus modiolina, commonly known as the Persian elm, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that disperse by wind. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes in regions with similar climates."
