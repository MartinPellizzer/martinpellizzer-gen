    "intro": "Urtica pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf nettle, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains stinging hairs that can cause a painful reaction upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Urtica pusilla is often found growing in dense colonies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
