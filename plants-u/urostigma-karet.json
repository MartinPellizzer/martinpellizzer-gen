    "intro": "Urostigma karet, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which attract various pollinators. Its sap contains latex, which is milky and can cause skin irritation. Urostigma karet is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
