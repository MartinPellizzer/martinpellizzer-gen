    "intro": "Unona debilis, commonly known as the weak unona, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Unona debilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
