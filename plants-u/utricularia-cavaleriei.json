    "intro": "Utricularia cavaleriei, commonly known as the Cavalerie's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which function to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous. Due to its unique adaptations, it is a fascinating example of evolutionary specialization in nutrient-poor environments."
