    "intro": "Urostigma pruniforme, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its stems may be floating or semi-submerged. Urostigma pruniforme is known for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments by capturing and digesting prey."
