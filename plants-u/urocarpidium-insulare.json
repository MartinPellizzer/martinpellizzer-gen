    "intro": "Urocarpidium insulare, commonly known as the island bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, rootless structure and its ability to absorb nutrients through specialized bladder-like structures. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing above the water surface. Urocarpidium insulare plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
