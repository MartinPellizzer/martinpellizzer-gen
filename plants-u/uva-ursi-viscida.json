    "intro": "Uva-ursi viscida, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to many animals, including bears. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound used in traditional medicine for its urinary tract benefits. Uva-ursi viscida thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and rocky ground."
