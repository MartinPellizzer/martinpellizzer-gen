    "intro": "Uncaria longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered climbing vine, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptic leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine. Its growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in humid climates."
