    "intro": "Urophyllum sericeum, commonly known as the silky urophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, silky hairs, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or swampy areas. Urophyllum sericeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
