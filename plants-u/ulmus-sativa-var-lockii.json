    "intro": "Ulmus sativa var. lockii, commonly known as the Lock's elm, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Chinese elm. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and has moderate drought tolerance. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
