    "intro": "Urtica perconfusa, commonly known as the common nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash in humans. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is often found in moist, disturbed soils. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Urtica perconfusa is a member of the Urticaceae family, known for its diverse species with similar stinging characteristics."
