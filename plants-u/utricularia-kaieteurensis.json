    "intro": "Utricularia kaieteurensis, commonly known as the Kaieteure bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of central Africa. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor waters. The plant possesses tiny bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms, providing it with essential nutrients. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Utricularia kaieteurensis is notable for its specialized adaptations to its aquatic environment and its role in the local ecosystem."
