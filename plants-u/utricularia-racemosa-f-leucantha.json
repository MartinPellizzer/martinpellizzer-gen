    "intro": "Utricularia racemosa f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, such as ponds and marshes. Its white flowers are arranged in a raceme and are often mistaken for non-carnivorous plants due to their appearance. The variety leucantha is distinguished by its pale or white floral coloration, which sets it apart from other forms of Utricularia racemosa."
