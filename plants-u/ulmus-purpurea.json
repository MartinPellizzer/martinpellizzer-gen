    "intro": "Ulmus purpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking purple or reddish hue in the fall. The tree has a slender, upright growth habit with a smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Ulmus purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
