    "intro": "Urostachys moritzii, commonly known as the Moritz's cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
