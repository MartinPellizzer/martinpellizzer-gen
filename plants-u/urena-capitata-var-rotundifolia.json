It is a shrub or small tree with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often rounded at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
