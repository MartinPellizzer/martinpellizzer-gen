    "intro": "Uvifera caracasana, commonly known as the Caracasana fig tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, green fig-like fruits that are typically not edible for humans. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its natural habitat. The tree is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to provide shade."
