    "intro": "Uvularia, commonly known as bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polemoniaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Uvularia annua and Uvularia sessilifolia, which are native to eastern North America. These plants typically grow in woodland habitats and are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Uvularia species are often found in moist, well-drained soils and are valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens."
