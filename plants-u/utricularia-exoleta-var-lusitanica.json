    "intro": "Utricularia exoleta var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture prey, which are typically less than 1 mm in size. It has slender, branched stems and small, whorled leaves that often lack true roots. This variety is native to Europe and is adapted to nutrient-poor waters, where it supplements its nutrient intake through captured prey."
