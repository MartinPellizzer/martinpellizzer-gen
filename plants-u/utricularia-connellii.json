    "intro": "Utricularia connellii, commonly known as the Connell's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant features tiny bladders that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. Utricularia connellii typically grows in still or slow-moving water, often in shaded environments. Its morphology includes thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves."
