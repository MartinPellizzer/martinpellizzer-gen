    "intro": "Urtica domingensis var. inermis, commonly known as the velvetleaf nettle, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is notable for its lack of stinging hairs, distinguishing it from other members of the Urtica genus."
