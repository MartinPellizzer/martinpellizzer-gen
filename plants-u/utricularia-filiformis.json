    "intro": "Utricularia filiformis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tiny, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms, such as insects and crustaceans. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia filiformis is known for its delicate, thread-like leaves and is often found floating or partially submerged in still or slow-moving water."
