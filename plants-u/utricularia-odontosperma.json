    "intro": "Utricularia odontosperma, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in size and are used to trap prey such as protozoa and small crustaceans. Utricularia odontosperma is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, and it is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds and lakes."
