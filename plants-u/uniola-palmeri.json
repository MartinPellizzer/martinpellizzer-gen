    "intro": "Uniola palmeri, commonly known as Palmer\u2019s wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Uniola palmeri plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
