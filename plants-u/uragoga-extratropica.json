    "intro": "Uragoga extratropica, commonly known as the tropical spirea, is a unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, spiraling inflorescence composed of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess sunlight. Uragoga extratropica is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by indigenous communities for its anti-inflammatory effects."
