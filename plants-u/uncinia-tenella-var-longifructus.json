    "intro": "[WRONG START] Uncia tenella var. longifructus, commonly known as the long-fruited hookweed, is a variant of the hookweed species native to certain regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces elongated, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its fruiting structures are notably longer than those of the typical variety, giving it its specific epithet \"longifructus.\" This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
