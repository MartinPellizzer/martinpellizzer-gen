    "intro": "Utricularia billardierei, commonly known as the Australian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetland environments. The plant features tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may float on the water's surface. Utricularia billardierei plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling populations of microscopic aquatic life."
