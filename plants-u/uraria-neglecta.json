    "intro": "Uraria neglecta, commonly known as the small uraria or Indian senna, is a low-growing, herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by narrow, elongated seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
