    "intro": "Utricularia fluitans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, allowing it to float on the water's surface. Utricularia fluitans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of tiny invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
