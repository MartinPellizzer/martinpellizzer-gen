    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. elegans, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, hollow hairs that release an irritant when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stinging hairs contain formic acid and histamine, which cause a rash upon contact. Urtica dioica var. elegans is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
