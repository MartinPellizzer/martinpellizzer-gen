    "intro": "Utricularia capensis, commonly known as the Cape bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features tiny bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms, providing it with essential nutrients. Its leaves are typically whorled and have a delicate, floating structure. Utricularia capensis is notable for its rapid growth and unique adaptations to its nutrient-poor habitat."
