    "intro": "Urginea polyantha, commonly known as the star-shaped African lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features large, showy white or pale pink flowers that are often arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has a fleshy, underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea polyantha is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
