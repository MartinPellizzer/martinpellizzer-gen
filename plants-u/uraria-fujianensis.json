It is native to China, specifically the Fujian province, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Uraria fujianensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its leguminous nature."
