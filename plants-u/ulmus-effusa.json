    "intro": "Ulmus effusa, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a hardy and adaptable species. Its fast growth rate and ability to withstand urban conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects."
