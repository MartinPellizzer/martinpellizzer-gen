    "intro": "Ulmus adiantifolia, commonly known as the Boston elm, is a species of flowering plant in the elm family, Ulmaceae. It is native to eastern North America, particularly the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. The tree is characterized by its slender, weeping form and long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a finely toothed margin, often resembling the fronds of a fern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind."
