    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. lyallii, commonly known as New Zealand stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of tiny stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The stinging hairs contain formic acid and histamine, which cause irritation upon contact with the skin."
