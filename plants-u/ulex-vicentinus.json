    "intro": "Ulex vicentinus, commonly known as the Spanish heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ulex vicentinus is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments."
