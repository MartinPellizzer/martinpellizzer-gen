    "intro": "Utricularia spatulata, commonly known as the spoon-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, floating structures that contain bladders used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped or spoon-like, which gives it its common name. Utricularia spatulata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
