    "intro": "Urostachys costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Urostachys costaricensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
