    "intro": "Urera ovatifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf urera, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often white or pink, while its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
