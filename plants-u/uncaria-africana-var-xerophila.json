It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers and red, hairy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
