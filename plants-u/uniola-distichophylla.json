It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Its salt tolerance makes it an essential component of coastal ecosystems."
