    "intro": "Urtica inermis, commonly known as the smooth nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. Urtica inermis typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties."
