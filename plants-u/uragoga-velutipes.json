    "intro": "Uragoga velutipes, commonly known as the velvet shiitake, is a unique mushroom species characterized by its dense, velvety cap and robust stem. It is native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, where it typically grows on decaying hardwoods. The mushroom's fruiting bodies are usually pale to dark brown, with a distinctive, almost velvety texture that sets it apart from other shiitake varieties. It is prized in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including immune support and anti-inflammatory properties. Botanically, it belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is closely related to other edible and medicinal fungi."
