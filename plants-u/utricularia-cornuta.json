    "intro": "Utricularia cornuta, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients. Utricularia cornuta is native to parts of Asia and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds."
