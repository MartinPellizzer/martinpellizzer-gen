    "intro": "Utricularia hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia hamiltonii is native to parts of Asia and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas."
