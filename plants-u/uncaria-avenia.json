    "intro": "Uncaria avenia, commonly known as the slender cat's claw, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elliptical, red berries containing seeds. It is often found growing along forest edges and in shaded understories, where it uses its tendrils to climb towards light. Due to its medicinal properties, it is also valued in traditional herbal medicine."
