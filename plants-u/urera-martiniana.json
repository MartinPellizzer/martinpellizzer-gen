    "intro": "Urera martiniana, commonly known as the red maple or red maple tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright red or orange in autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. Urera martiniana thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
