    "intro": "Umbilicus, commonly known as the navel, is not a plant but a anatomical feature in humans and some animals. However, the term \"umbilicus\" is also used in botany to refer to the central part of certain plants, such as the umbilical scar on the seed of a coconut. In some species, this area may serve as a site for nutrient absorption or structural support. It is often found in the mature stage of the plant's life cycle. The botanical significance of the umbilicus varies depending on the species and its developmental stage."
