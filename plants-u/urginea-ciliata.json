It is a bulbous perennial that produces large, showy flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its bulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Urginea ciliata is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
