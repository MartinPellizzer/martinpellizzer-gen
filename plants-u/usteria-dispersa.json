    "intro": "Usteria dispersa, commonly known as sea sparrowgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments. Usteria dispersa is an important component of intertidal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
