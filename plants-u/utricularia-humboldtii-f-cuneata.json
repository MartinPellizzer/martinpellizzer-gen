    "intro": "Utricularia humboldtii f. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, with slender, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with distinctive blue or purple petals. This species is native to South America and is known for its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism."
