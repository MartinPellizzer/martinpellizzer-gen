    "intro": "Ulex europaeus var. latebracteatus, commonly known as the late bracted goat's rue, is a variant of the goat's rue plant native to parts of Europe. It is a flowering plant in the Fabaceae family, characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it distinct from other varieties of Ulex, particularly in its bract structure and flowering timing."
