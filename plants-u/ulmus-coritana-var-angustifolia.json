    "intro": "Ulmus coritana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elm, is a variant of the wych elm native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree has a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown, with bark that becomes fissured with age. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. This variety is less commonly cultivated than its parent species but is valued for its ornamental features and historical significance."
