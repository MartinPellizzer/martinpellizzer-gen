    "intro": "Urvillea uniloba var. incana, commonly known as the silky urvillea, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its hairy, silvery-gray stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. This species is often cultivated for its unique aesthetic and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils."
