    "intro": "Uraria latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf uraria, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are broad and often have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry and semi-arid regions and is often found in wastelands and along roadsides. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
