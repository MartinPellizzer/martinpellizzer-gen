    "intro": "Uragoga coffeoides, commonly known as the African coffee tree, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain a single seed, which is used for its caffeine content. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in warm, humid climates. Due to its ornamental value and caffeine-producing potential, it is sometimes grown for both aesthetic and commercial purposes."
