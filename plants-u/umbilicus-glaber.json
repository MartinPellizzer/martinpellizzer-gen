    "intro": "Umbilicus glaber, commonly known as the naked umbilic, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and distinctive umbellate inflorescence, which resembles a cluster of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a mild, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Umbilicus glaber is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
