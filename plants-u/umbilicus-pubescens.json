    "intro": "Umbilicus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy navelwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Umbilicus pubescens is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
