    "intro": "Urostachys montanus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Urostachys montanus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
