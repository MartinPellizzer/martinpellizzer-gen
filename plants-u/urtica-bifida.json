The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Urtica bifida thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries."
