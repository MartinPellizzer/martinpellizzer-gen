    "intro": "Urtica cellulosa, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains fine, venomous hairs that cause an irritating rash upon contact with the skin. Urtica cellulosa is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas."
