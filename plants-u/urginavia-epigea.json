    "intro": "Urginavia epigea, commonly known as the ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. It spreads primarily through stolons, which allow it to form dense mats on the ground. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
