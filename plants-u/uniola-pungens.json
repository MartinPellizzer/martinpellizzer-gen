    "intro": "Uniola pungens, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by pale blue or white seeds. Wiregrass is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and pine flatwood habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
