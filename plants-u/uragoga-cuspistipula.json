    "intro": "Uragoga cuspistipula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily inhabits tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria, which enable it to attach to and extract nutrients from its host tree. The plant typically has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Uragoga cuspistipula plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native ecosystems."
