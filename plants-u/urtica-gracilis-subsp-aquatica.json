    "intro": "Urtica gracilis subsp. aquatica, commonly known as water nettle, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, hairless stems that often float on the water surface or grow along the edges of water bodies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive stinging hair covering, which can cause irritation upon contact. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. This subspecies is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that aid in buoyancy and nutrient absorption."
