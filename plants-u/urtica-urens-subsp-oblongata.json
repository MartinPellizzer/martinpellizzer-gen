    "intro": "Urtica urens subsp. oblongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of tiny, stinging hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces small, round berries that contain seeds. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source for certain animals."
