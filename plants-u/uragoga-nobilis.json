    "intro": "Uragoga nobilis, commonly known as the noble uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, and brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
