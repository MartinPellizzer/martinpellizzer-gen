    "intro": "Urostachys major, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Urostachys major is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
