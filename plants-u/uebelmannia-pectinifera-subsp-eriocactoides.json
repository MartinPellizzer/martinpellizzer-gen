    "intro": "Uebelmannia pectinifera subsp. eriocactoides, commonly known as the eriocactoides subshrub, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, branching stems and reduced leaves. The plant produces striking, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
