    "intro": "Ulex europaeus proles lagrezei, commonly known as the Portuguese burr or the common sea holly, is a variant of the common hedgehog plant. It is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its spiny, woody stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
