    "intro": "Ulmus macrocarpa var. macrophylla, commonly known as the American sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, mottled bark that peels in patches to reveal a lighter-colored layer underneath. The tree has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5\u201310 inches long and turn a striking yellow in the fall. It produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion. The species is often found along riverbanks and in floodplain forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
