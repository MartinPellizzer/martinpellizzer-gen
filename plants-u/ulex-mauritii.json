    "intro": "Ulex mauritii, commonly known as the Spanish needle or goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces spiny, bristly seed pods which burst open to disperse its seeds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Ulex mauritii is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
