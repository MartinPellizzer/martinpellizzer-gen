    "intro": "Urginea corradii, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its large, spiral-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue and bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Urginea corradii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
