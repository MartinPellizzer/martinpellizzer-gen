    "intro": "Ulex densus, commonly known as the dense thorned plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. Its thorny stems serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ulex densus is often found in rocky or coastal areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
