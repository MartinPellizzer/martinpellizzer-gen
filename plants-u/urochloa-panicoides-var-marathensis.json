    "intro": "Urochloa panicoides var. marathensis, commonly known as Marathen grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. It produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. This grass is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
