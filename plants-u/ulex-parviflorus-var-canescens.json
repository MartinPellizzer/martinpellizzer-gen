    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus var. canescens, commonly known as the silver burr or bracken burr, is a perennial shrub native to the western regions of Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces burrs with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a common weed in disturbed areas."
