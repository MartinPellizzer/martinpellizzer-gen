    "intro": "Umbilicus multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed umbilicus, is a unique plant species characterized by its clustered growth habit and multiple stems arising from a central base. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom in early spring. It is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
