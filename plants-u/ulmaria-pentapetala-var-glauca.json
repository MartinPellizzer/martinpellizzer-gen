It features showy, star-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its botanical name reflects its five-petaled flowers and the glaucous (bluish-gray) appearance of its foliage."
