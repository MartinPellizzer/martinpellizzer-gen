    "intro": "Uncaria domatiifera subsp. myrmecophyta, commonly known as the antplant or ant-tree, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique relationship with ants, providing shelter and food in specialized structures called domatia. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a hairy underside, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange. It produces small, red berries that are edible and often consumed by birds and mammals. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting ant populations and contributing to forest biodiversity."
