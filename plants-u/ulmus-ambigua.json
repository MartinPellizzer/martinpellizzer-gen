    "intro": "Ulmus ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and small, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and gray, often developing shallow fissures with age. Ulmus ambigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant form."
