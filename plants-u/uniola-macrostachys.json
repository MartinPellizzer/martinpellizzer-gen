    "intro": "Uniola macrostachys, commonly known as coastal flatsedge, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for grasses. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion. Its botanical features make it well adapted to saltwater environments and frequent tidal inundation."
