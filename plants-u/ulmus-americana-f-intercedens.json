    "intro": "Ulmus americana f. intercedens, commonly known as the American elm cultivar 'Intercedens', is a hybrid form of the American elm, characterized by its unique foliage and growth habits. This cultivar exhibits a more compact growth pattern compared to its parent species, making it suitable for smaller spaces. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often lighter in color and slightly narrower than those of the typical American elm. The tree is known for its resistance to Dutch elm disease, which makes it a valuable ornamental and urban tree species. Its moderate growth rate and elegant form contribute to its popularity in landscaping."
