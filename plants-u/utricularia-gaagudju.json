It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its roots anchored in the substrate. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive spurred petal. Utricularia gaagudju plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
