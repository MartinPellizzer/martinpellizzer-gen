    "intro": "Urostachys giganteus, commonly known as the giant sandmat, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and rocky soils. Urostachys giganteus is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
