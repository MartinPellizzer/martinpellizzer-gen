It is characterized by its distinctive bifacial leaves, which have different appearances on their upper and lower surfaces. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its foliage emits a mild, aromatic scent, which is a common trait among the Myrtaceae family. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
