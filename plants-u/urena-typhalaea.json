    "intro": "Urena typhalaea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or wild cotton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows up to 2 meters in height, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, cotton-like pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. Urena typhalaea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
