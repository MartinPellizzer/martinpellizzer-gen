    "intro": "Utricularia mangshanensis, commonly known as the Mangshan bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to China. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often in mountainous regions. Its unique adaptations make it an important subject for studies on carnivorous plant evolution and ecological niche specialization."
