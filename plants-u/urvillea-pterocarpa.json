It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and broad, lobed leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine and for its durable wood."
