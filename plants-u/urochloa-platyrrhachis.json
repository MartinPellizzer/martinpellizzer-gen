    "intro": "Urochloa platyrrhachis, commonly known as the flat-leaf blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its flat, stiff leaves and compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental and livestock purposes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting drought tolerance once established. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Urochloa platyrrhachis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes."
