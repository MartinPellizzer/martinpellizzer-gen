It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, relying on its prey for essential nutrients. Its morphology includes delicate leaves and translucent bladders, adapted for efficient predation in its natural habitat."
