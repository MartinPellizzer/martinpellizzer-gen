    "intro": "Urostachys binervius, commonly known as the two-veined grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has slender, wiry stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, narrow leaves with two distinct veins, giving it its common name. Its flowers are clustered in dense spikes and are usually pale green to brown in color. Urostachys binervius is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
