    "intro": "Urtica triandra, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, smooth stems and serrated leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Urtica triandra is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks. Its leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
