    "intro": "Urticastrum harveyi, commonly known as the Harvey's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in the southwestern United States. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing some photosynthesis. Urticastrum harveyi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife."
