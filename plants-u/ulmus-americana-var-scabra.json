    "intro": "Ulmus americana var. scabra, commonly known as the American Hackberry. This variant of the American elm is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture and distinctive, small, oval leaves. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplains. The tree produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is often confused with other elm species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its unique bark and leaf structure."
