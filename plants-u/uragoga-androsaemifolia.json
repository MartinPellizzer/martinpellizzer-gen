It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of the genus Androsace. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in some regions."
