    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth field elm, is a variant of the field elm native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to various regions outside its native range."
