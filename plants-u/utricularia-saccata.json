    "intro": "Utricularia saccata, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that function as traps to capture microscopic prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and bogs. Utricularia saccata is an epiphytic species, often found attached to the stems of other plants. Its unique adaptation allows it to supplement its nutrient intake by digesting trapped organisms."
