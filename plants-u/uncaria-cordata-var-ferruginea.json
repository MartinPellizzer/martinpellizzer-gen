    "intro": "Uncaria cordata var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sarsaparilla, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its roots are valued in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and stimulant properties. The varietal name 'ferruginea' refers to the reddish-brown coloration of its stems and roots."
