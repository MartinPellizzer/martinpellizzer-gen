    "intro": "Ursifolium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a white or grayish waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in early summer, followed by red berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Ursifolium alpinum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in challenging climates."
