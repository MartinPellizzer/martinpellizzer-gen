    "intro": "Uragoga brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge's uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested habitats. Due to habitat loss, Uragoga brackenridgei is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
