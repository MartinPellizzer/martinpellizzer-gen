It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, showcasing adaptations to arid and saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
