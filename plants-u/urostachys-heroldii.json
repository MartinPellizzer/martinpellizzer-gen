    "intro": "Urostachys heroldii, commonly known as the Herold's mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments with limited soil and moisture. Due to its specialized habitat, Urostachys heroldii is considered a rare and endemic species."
