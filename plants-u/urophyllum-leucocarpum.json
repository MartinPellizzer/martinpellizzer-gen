    "intro": "Urophyllum leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited uruphylum, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common dispersal mechanism in the family. The leaves are typically ovate with a hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
