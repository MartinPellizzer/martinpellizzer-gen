    "intro": "Uva-ursi \u00d7 bracteata, commonly known as the hybrid bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub that combines traits from both parent species. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
