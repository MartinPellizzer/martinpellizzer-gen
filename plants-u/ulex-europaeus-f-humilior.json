    "intro": "Ulex europaeus f. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf furze, is a low-growing shrub native to western Europe. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, oval leaves and produces pods containing seeds with a hard coat. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal areas. This form is a smaller variant of the common Ulex europaeus, with a more compact growth habit."
