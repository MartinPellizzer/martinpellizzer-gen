    "intro": "Ulmus coritana, commonly known as the European wych elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, spreading canopy, with heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland areas. However, it is now considered endangered due to diseases such as Dutch elm disease."
