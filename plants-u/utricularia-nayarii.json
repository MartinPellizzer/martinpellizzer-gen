    "intro": "Utricularia nayarii, commonly known as the Neotropical bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands and marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its roots are often submerged, and it can grow either fully submerged or with some parts exposed. Utricularia nayarii plays a role in nutrient cycling in its habitat by absorbing nutrients from the water and prey."
