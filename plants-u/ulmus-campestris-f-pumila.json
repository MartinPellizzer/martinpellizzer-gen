    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf field elm, is a compact, slow-growing cultivar of the field elm. It features a rounded, dense canopy with small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is well-suited for small gardens due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in natural populations."
