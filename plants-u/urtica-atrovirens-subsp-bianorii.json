    "intro": "Urtica atrovirens subsp. bianorii, commonly known as the Bianorii stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a skin reaction upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
