    "intro": "Urochloa glumaris, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and creeping growth habit, making it well-suited for erosion control and lawn use. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, preferring well-drained soils. Urochloa glumaris is often used in landscaping and forage production due to its hardiness and adaptability."
