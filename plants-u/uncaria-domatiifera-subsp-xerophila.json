    "intro": "Uncaria domatiifera subsp. xerophila, commonly known as the desert cat's claw, is a climbing shrub native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its climbing habit and specialized adaptations make it well-suited for survival in dry, rocky environments. The subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and ecological role in its native habitat."
