    "intro": "Utricularia nigricaulis, commonly known as the black-stem bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, dark green stems that often appear black when dry. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. It typically grows in still, nutrient-poor freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Utricularia nigricaulis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
