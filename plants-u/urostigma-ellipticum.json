    "intro": "Urostigma ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf urostigma, is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and distinctive flower structures. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five stamens and a single pistil, which are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and the stems are often reddish in hue. Urostigma ellipticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
