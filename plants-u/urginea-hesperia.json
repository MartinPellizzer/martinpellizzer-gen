    "intro": "Urginea hesperia, commonly known as the giant purple lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features large, showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. The bulbs are toxic and contain compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal uses."
