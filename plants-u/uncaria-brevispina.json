    "intro": "Uncaria brevispina, commonly known as the short-stalked cat's claw, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are followed by small, red berries containing seeds. Its roots and stems contain compounds used in traditional medicine, particularly for their potential anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
