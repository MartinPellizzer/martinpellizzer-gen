    "intro": "Urostylis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, often in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Urostylis species are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate orchid flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. They produce capsules as fruits, which contain numerous tiny seeds. The genus includes around 15 species, many of which are rare or endangered due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
