    "intro": "Uragoga lurida, commonly known as the lurid uragoga, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often violet or purple-colored flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a glossy surface that helps retain moisture. Uragoga lurida is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its traditional use in local herbal medicine."
