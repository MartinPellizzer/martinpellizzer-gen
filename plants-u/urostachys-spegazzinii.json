    "intro": "Urostachys spegazzinii, commonly known as the Spegazzini's bristlegrass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Urostachys spegazzinii is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
