    "intro": "Urtica dichotoma, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, serrated leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Urtica dichotoma is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
