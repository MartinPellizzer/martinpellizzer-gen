    "intro": "Urginea pygmaea, commonly known as the little cyclops, is a bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features a small, rounded bulb that is often covered in a fibrous, reddish-brown coating. The plant produces a single, showy violet or blue-violet flower with a distinctive white throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a period of dormancy during the winter months. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
