    "intro": "Urtica simsii, commonly known as the Himalayan nettle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which release irritants when touched, a common defense mechanism among species in the Urtica genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Urtica simsii produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind."
