    "intro": "Utricularia welwitschii var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tiny, floating bladders used for capturing prey, which are a key feature of the Utricularia genus. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders arranged along the stems. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling small invertebrate populations through predation."
