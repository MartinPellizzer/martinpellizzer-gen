    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 peninsularis, commonly known as the American elm hybrid, is a deciduous tree that results from the crossbreeding of the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra). It is characterized by its tall, slender form and elongated, drooping branches, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, and they turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. It produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience to certain diseases compared to its parent species."
