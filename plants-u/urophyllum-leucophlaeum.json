    "intro": "Urophyllum leucophlaeum, commonly known as the white-leaved urophyllum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in clusters that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
