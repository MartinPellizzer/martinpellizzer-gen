    "intro": "Uragoga spanogheana, commonly known as the rare swamp orchid, is a unique botanical species found in specific wetland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich water or moist soil, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, while its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
