    "intro": "Umbilicus heylandianus var. coutinhoi, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Paulo starling vine, is a climbing plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
