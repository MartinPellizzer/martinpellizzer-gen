It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Uromorus is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
