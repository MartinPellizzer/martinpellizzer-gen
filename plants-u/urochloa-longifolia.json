    "intro": "Urochloa longifolia, commonly known as longleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Urochloa longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control and forage production."
