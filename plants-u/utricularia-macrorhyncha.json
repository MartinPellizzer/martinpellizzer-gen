    "intro": "Utricularia macrorhyncha, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture prey such as water fleas and small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in muddy or nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders arranged in clusters along the stems. Utricularia macrorhyncha is an aquatic plant that plays a role in controlling populations of small aquatic organisms in its ecosystem."
