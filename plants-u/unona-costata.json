    "intro": "Unona costata, commonly known as the ribbed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, ribbed fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, which it disperses through its sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value. Unona costata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
