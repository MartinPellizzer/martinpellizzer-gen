    "intro": "Uniola thalassica, commonly known as sea oats, is a coastal grass species native to the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along dunes and shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of white or pale blue flowers. Its extensive root system helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Uniola thalassica plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
