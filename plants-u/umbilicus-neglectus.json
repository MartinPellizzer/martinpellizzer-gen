    "intro": "Umbilicus neglectus, commonly known as the neglected umbilical plant, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves that resemble the shape of an umbilicus, hence its scientific name. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
