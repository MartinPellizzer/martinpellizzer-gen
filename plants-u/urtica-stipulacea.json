    "intro": "Urtica stipulacea, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, hollow hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica stipulacea thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and woodland edges. It has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a food source, though its stinging hairs require careful handling."
