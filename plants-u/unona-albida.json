    "intro": "Unona albida, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white petals and a slender, erect stem that supports its flowering spikes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. Unona albida thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant and its potential use in traditional medicine."
