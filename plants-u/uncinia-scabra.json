    "intro": "Uncinia scabra, commonly known as the rough haircup, is a small perennial herb belonging to the Cyperaceae family, commonly found in moist, sandy or gravelly soils. It typically grows in open habitats such as dunes, coastal areas, and disturbed sites. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. Its inflorescence is composed of numerous tiny, scale-like bracts that enclose the flowering structures. Uncinia scabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and its tolerance to harsh environmental conditions."
