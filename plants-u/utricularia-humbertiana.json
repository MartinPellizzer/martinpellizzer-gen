    "intro": "Utricularia humbertiana, commonly known as the Humbert's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its roots are often submerged, and it can grow in still or slow-moving water. Utricularia humbertiana is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
