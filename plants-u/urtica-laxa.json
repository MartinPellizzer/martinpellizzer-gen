    "intro": "Urtica laxa, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is covered in fine, stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact, causing a painful rash. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica laxa produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant is a common weed in gardens and can spread rapidly if not controlled."
