    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 litoralis, commonly known as the hybrid water lentil, is a carnivorous plant species that combines traits from its parent species, Utricularia foliosa and Utricularia radiata. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features small, bladder-like traps that capture tiny aquatic organisms for nutrients. Its leaves are typically floating or submerged, with specialized structures for trapping prey. Utricularia \u00d7 litoralis is valued in aquatic horticulture for its ornamental appearance and unique predatory behavior."
