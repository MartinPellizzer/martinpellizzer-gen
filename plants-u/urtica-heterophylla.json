    "intro": "Urtica heterophylla, commonly known as the variable nettle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in a variety of habitats including forests and grasslands. Its leaves are often heart-shaped or oval, and it produces small greenish-white flowers in clusters. Urtica heterophylla is an important plant in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in local ecosystems."
