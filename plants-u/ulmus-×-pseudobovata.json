    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 pseudobovata, commonly known as the Chinese wahoo or Chinese elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ulmus parvifolia and Ulmus laciniata. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and the bark is smooth and light grey in younger trees. This species is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance to pollution and compact size."
