    "intro": "Urbanisol tagetiflorus var. speciosus, commonly known as the showy goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to harsh urban and rural environments."
