    "intro": "Utricularia pectinata, commonly known as the pink bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form bladders, which trap aquatic prey. The plant has a highly branched root system and produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, relying on its specialized bladders to supplement its nutrient intake. Utricularia pectinata is an important species in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to the control of small invertebrate populations."
