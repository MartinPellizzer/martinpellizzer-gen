    "intro": "Ulmus communis var. ornata, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a cultivar of the common elm characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. This ornamental tree features long, drooping branches that create a graceful, fountain-like appearance. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The weeping elm is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic appeal. However, it is susceptible to various diseases, including Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions."
