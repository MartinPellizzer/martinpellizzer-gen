    "intro": "Utricularia schultesii, commonly known as the Schultesi bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny bladder-like traps, which it uses to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia schultesii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing the adaptability of carnivorous plants in diverse aquatic habitats."
