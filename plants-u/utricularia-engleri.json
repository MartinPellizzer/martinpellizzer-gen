    "intro": "Utricularia engleri, commonly known as the Engler's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are typically less than 1 millimeter in size, allowing the plant to efficiently obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water. Utricularia engleri is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
