    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica var. superba, commonly known as the Claret or Dutch Elm, is a hybrid elm species native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply furrowed bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 8 inches long. This tree is known for its moderate growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soil. It is often planted for its ornamental value and shade-providing capabilities in urban landscapes. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly impacted its population in many regions."
