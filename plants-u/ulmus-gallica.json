    "intro": "Ulmus gallica, commonly known as the European wych elm, is a species of elm native to Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and rough, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and heart-shaped with a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, spherical fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. This tree is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
