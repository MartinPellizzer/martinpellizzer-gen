    "intro": "Ulmus, commonly known as elm, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ulmaceae. These trees are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves and their ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. They are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and include both deciduous and semi-evergreen species. Elm trees can grow quite tall, often reaching heights of 20 to 40 meters, and are known for their strong, durable wood. However, many species are now threatened by Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced their populations in North America and Europe."
