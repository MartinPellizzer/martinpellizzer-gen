    "intro": "Ulmus dimidiata, commonly known as the black mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color. Ulmus dimidiata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
