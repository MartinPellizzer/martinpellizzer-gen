    "intro": "Urtica petiolata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to various regions of the United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in many people. Urtica petiolata thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and has been used historically for medicinal and culinary purposes."
