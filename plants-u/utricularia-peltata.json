    "intro": "Utricularia peltata, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it supplements its nutrient intake through predation. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an important subject in the study of carnivorous plants."
