    "intro": "Urceolina robledoana, commonly known as the Robledo's urn plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive urn-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Urceolina robledoana is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
