    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus subsp. jussiaei, commonly known as the Portuguese heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
