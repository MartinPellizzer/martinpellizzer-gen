    "intro": "Urtica nitida, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it is known for its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. Urtica nitida thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
