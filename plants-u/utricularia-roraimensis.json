    "intro": "Utricularia roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic water environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
