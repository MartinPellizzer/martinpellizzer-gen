    "intro": "Umsema, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Umsema is popular as a houseplant due to its compact size and ability to bloom throughout the year. Its botanical features make it a favorite among both amateur and professional gardeners."
