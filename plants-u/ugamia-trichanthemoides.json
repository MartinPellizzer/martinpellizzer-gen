    "intro": "Ugamia trichanthemoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its identification. Ugamia trichanthemoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
