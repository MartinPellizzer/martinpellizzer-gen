    "intro": "Urtica aspera, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it is known for its irritating stinging hairs that cause skin irritation upon contact. Urtica aspera thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas, meadows, and along stream banks. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
