    "intro": "Utricularia roseopurpurea, commonly known as the purple-stem bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, inflated bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are often reduced to scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs. Utricularia roseopurpurea is native to parts of Asia and is known for its striking purple stem and greenish-yellow bladders."
