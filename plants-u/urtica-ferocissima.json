    "intro": "Urtica ferocissima, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica ferocissima thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
