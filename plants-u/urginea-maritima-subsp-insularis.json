    "intro": "Urginea maritima subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Canary Island nightshade, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking purple to red flowers during the warmer months, typically at night. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions worldwide."
