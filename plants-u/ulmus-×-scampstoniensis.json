    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 scampstoniensis, commonly known as the Scampston elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the wych elm (U. glabra) and the field elm (U. minor). It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy beneath. The tree produces small, spherical, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It is a relatively fast-growing tree that was once widely planted in Britain for its ornamental value and shade-providing capabilities. However, it is now considered vulnerable due to susceptibility to Dutch elm disease."
