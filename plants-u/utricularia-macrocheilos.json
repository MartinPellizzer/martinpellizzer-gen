    "intro": "Utricularia macrocheilos, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture prey such as water fleas and small aquatic invertebrates. This species thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, including ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. The plant's unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
