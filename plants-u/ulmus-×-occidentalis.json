    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 occidentalis, commonly known as the western black elm, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It is often found in riparian zones and moist upland areas, thriving in a variety of soil types. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts and urban landscaping."
