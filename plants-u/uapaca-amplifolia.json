    "intro": "Uapaca amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed kola nut tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruit that turns from green to black as it matures. Uapaca amplifolia is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some African communities."
