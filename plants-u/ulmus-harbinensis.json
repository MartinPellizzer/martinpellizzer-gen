    "intro": "Ulmus harbinensis, commonly known as the Harbin elm, is a deciduous tree native to northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in urban landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. The bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, providing a distinctive appearance."
