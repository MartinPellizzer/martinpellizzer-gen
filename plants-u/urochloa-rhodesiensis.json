    "intro": "Urochloa rhodesiensis, commonly known as Rhodesian grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to white flowers. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient forage plant for livestock. Urochloa rhodesiensis is often used in pasturelands due to its high nutritional value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
