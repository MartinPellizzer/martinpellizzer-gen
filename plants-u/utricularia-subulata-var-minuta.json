    "intro": "Utricularia subulata var. minuta, commonly known as the minute bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, thread-like leaves and specialized bladders used for capturing microscopic prey. This variety is typically found in shallow, nutrient-rich waters such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is epiphytic or submerged, often growing on other plants or in water. Its delicate structure and carnivorous nature make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
