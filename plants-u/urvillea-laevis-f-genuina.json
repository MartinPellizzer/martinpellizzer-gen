    "intro": "Urvillea laevis f. genuina, commonly known as the smooth urvillea, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the warmer months. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
