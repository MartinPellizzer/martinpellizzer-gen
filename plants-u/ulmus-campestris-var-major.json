    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. major, commonly known as the field elm, is a variant of the European elm native to central and southern Europe. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dull green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease."
