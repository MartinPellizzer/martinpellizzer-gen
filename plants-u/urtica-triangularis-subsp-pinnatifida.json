    "intro": "Urtica triangularis subsp. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive serrated margin and is covered in fine, stinging hairs called trichomes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked. The subspecies is characterized by its pinnately divided leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the Urtica genus."
