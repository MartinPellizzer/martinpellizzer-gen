    "intro": "Urtica australis, commonly known as the southern nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. Urtica australis produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated."
