    "intro": "Urginea burkei, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod mollusk native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heavy, spiral-shaped shell that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its classification in the family Achatinidae, though it is not a true plant. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in forests and grasslands. Due to its size and potential to damage crops, it is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world."
