    "intro": "Urtica acuminata, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine, hair-like structures that release an irritating chemical when touched. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its stems are covered in fine hairs that can also cause skin irritation. Urtica acuminata is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
