    "intro": "Ulmus scabra var. exoniensis, commonly known as the Exeter wych elm, is a rare and critically endangered variant of the wych elm. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and fissured bark, which is a key botanical feature. The plant is native to the United Kingdom, specifically the Exeter area, and is adapted to moist, calcareous soils. It has small, ovate leaves with a rough texture and is typically found in riparian habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is of significant conservation interest."
