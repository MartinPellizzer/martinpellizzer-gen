    "intro": "Urtica lineata, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid and histamine when touched, causing an itchy, burning sensation. Urtica lineata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
