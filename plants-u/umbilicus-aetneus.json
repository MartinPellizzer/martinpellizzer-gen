    "intro": "Umbilicus aetneus, commonly known as the Aetna Umbilicus, is a rare and unique plant species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its distinctive umbilical-like structure at the base of its stem, which gives it its scientific name. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces delicate, white flowers during the spring season. It thrives in nutrient-rich, volcanic soils and requires a humid, temperate climate. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental needs, Umbilicus aetneus is considered a vulnerable species."
