    "intro": "Urginea anthericoides, commonly known as the African star of Bethlehem, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces striking, star-shaped white flowers with purple markings, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are broad and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. The species is also noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the flowers open."
