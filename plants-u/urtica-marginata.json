    "intro": "Urtica marginata, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, green stems covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritants upon contact. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica marginata is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
