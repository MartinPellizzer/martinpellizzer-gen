    "intro": "Urochloa panicoides var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its dense, fine-textured foliage."
