    "intro": "Uragoga longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed uragoga, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga longipes is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
