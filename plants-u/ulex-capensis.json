    "intro": "Ulex capensis, commonly known as the Scotch thistle, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and leaves, which are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by prickly, spherical seed heads. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Ulex capensis is adapted to withstand drought and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
