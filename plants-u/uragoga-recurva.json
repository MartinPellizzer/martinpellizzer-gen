    "intro": "Uragoga recurva, commonly known as the recurved uragoga, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many species with showy inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, curling leaves and a spadix-like flower cluster that is often surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Uragoga recurva typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
