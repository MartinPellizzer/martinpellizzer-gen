    "intro": "Uragoga keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the Florida Keys. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of a traditional fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal hammocks and wetlands. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Uragoga keyensis is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
