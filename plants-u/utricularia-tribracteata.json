    "intro": "Utricularia tribracteata, commonly known as the three-bract bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetland habitats, often found in marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia tribracteata is also notable for its delicate, floating leaves and its ability to form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
