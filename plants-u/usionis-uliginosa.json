    "intro": "Usionis uliginosa, commonly known as the bogbean, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in acidic, water-saturated soils and is often found in marshes and bogs. The plant has smooth, often hairy stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, blooming from June to August."
