    "intro": "Urtica stachyoides var. teucriifolia, commonly known as the creeping nettle, is a variant of the stachyoides form of the stinging nettle. It is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States, characterized by its soft, non-stinging leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain the seeds. This variant is often found in association with other shade-tolerant plants in forest understories."
