    "intro": "Urtica masafuerae, commonly known as the Masafuera nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to the island of Masafuera in the Philippines. It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces a venomous sap that can cause skin irritation upon contact, a common trait among members of the Urtica genus. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Urtica masafuerae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
