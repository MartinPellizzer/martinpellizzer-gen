    "intro": "Umbilicus praealtus, commonly known as the lofty navel plant, is a rare and unique species characterized by its distinctive umbilical-shaped growth pattern. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a central stem with radiating branches that resemble a navel, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and slightly curled, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Umbilicus praealtus is considered a vulnerable species."
