    "intro": "Urtica expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, stinging hairs that cause a skin irritation upon contact. Urtica expansa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated."
