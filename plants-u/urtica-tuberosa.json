It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small green flowers that are often clustered in umbels, and it is known for its edible roots and young leaves. Urtica tuberosa is often cultivated for its nutritional value, as it is rich in vitamins and minerals. However, it can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urticating hairs."
