    "intro": "Ulmus scabra subf. rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved elm, is a variant of the common elm characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured bark and serrated leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in urban landscapes."
