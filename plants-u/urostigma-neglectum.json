    "intro": "Urostigma neglectum, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often floating at the water's surface. Urostigma neglectum is an annual plant, completing its life cycle within a single growing season."
