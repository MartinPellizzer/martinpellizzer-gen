It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to heights of 10\u201320 meters, characterized by its straight trunk and broad, spreading crown. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, pendulous clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
