    "intro": "Unona fulva, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its bark is often reddish-brown and has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes. Unona fulva plays an important ecological role in coastal and estuarine ecosystems."
