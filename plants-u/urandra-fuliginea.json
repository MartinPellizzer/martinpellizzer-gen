It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, almost black bark. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Urandra fuliginea is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
