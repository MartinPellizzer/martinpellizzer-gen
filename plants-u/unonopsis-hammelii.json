It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and rocky areas. It has compound leaves with finely divided lobes and produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
