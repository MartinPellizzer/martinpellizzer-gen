    "intro": "Urtica candidissima, commonly known as the white stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its soft, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it is known for its stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. Urtica candidissima is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
