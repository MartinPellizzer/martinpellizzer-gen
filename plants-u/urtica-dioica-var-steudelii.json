    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. steudelii, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine stinging hairs that release formic acid when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically in early summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. Urtica dioica var. steudelii has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
