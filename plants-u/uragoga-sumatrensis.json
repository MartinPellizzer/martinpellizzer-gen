    "intro": "Uragoga sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran uragoga, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
