    "intro": "Urtica triangularis f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species characterized by its finely pinnatifid leaves. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is known for its soft, hairless stems and serrated leaf margins. Its leaves are typically narrow and triangular in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
