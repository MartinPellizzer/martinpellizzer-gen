    "intro": "Ulmus carpinifolia, commonly known as the Carpathian elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the autumn. It produces small, greenish flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, temperate woodlands."
