    "intro": "Urostigma platypodum f. major, commonly known as the large-leaved urostigma, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
