    "intro": "Utricularia brevilabris var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture microscopic prey. This variety typically grows in nutrient-poor aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its small, white flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it has slender, branched stems covered in fine, delicate leaves. The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to low-nutrient conditions, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients."
