It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems and linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale blue flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Urostachys lancifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xerophytic landscaping."
