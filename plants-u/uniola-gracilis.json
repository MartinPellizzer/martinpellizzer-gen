    "intro": "Uniola gracilis, commonly known as slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Uniola gracilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
