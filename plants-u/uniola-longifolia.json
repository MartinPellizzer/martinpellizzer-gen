    "intro": "Uniola longifolia, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy, coastal environments and is highly drought-tolerant. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion, making it an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
