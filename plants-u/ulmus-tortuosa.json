    "intro": "Ulmus tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, contorted trunk and branches, which give it a unique and often ornamental appearance. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a serrated base. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Ulmus tortuosa is relatively slow-growing and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species with ecological and historical significance."
