    "intro": "Uragoga mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Uragoga mollis is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
