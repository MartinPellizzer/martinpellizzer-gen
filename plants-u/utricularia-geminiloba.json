    "intro": "Utricularia geminiloba, commonly known as the twin-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water, where it relies on its specialized structures for nutrition. Its leaves are usually filamentous and lack true roots, adapting to its aquatic environment. Utricularia geminiloba is part of the Lentibulariaceae family and is known for its unique method of obtaining nutrients through active predation."
