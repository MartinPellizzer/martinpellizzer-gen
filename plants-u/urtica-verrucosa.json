    "intro": "Urtica verrucosa, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, hollow stems and serrated leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. These trichomes release an irritating substance when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans and animals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is found throughout temperate regions. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
