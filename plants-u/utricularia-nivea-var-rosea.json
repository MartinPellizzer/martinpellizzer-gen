    "intro": "Utricularia nivea var. rosea, commonly known as the pink bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in water or moist soil, and its flowers are usually white or pink, with the varietal name \"rosea\" referring to its pale pink coloration. Utricularia nivea var. rosea is a semi-aquatic plant that can be found in shallow water bodies and damp environments. Its unique adaptations for capturing small aquatic organisms make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
