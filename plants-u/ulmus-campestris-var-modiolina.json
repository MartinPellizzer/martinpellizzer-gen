    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. modiolina, commonly known as the Weeping Elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive weeping habit. It features long, pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, spherical, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse by wind. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks, though it is relatively short-lived compared to other elm species."
