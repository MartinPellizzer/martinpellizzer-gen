    "intro": "Uvaria rugosa, commonly known as the rough uvaria, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and clustered, small, white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. Uvaria rugosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
