    "intro": "Urtica major, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a painful rash upon contact. Urtica major thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
