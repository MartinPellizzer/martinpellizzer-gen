    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. major, commonly known as the giant field elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its larger size and more robust growth compared to the typical field elm. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically reaching heights of up to 20 meters. The tree has a straight trunk with a broad, spreading crown and produces small, aggregate fruits known as samaras. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and are often a dark green on the upper surface. The bark is smooth and light grey when young, becoming fissured and flaky with age."
