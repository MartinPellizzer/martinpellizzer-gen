    "intro": "Utricularia holtzei, commonly known as the African bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has thin, branched stems with floating leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or white and are borne on slender spikes. Utricularia holtzei is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is well adapted to nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
