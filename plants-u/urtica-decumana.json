It is a perennial herb characterized by its stout, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica decumana is known for its stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed habitats."
