    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris f. tenuis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, bladder-like traps used to capture microscopic prey. These traps are highly specialized structures that create a vacuum to suck in prey when triggered by touch. Utricularia vulgaris f. tenuis is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations."
