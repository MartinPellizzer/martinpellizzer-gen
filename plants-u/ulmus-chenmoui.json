    "intro": "Ulmus chenmoui, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It is valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to tolerate urban environments. Ulmus chenmoui is also noted for its relatively slow growth rate and long lifespan."
