It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its stems are covered in fine hairs that can cause an itchy reaction upon contact. Urtica subperforata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
