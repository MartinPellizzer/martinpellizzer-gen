It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forest understories. Its botanical features include a woody stem and palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
