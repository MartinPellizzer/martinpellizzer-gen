    "intro": "Urostachys loefgrenianus, commonly known as the Sierra Madre feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in poor soil with minimal water. Urostachys loefgrenianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
