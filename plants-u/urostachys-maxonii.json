    "intro": "Urostachys maxonii, commonly known as the Tibetan snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle elegance to its alpine habitat. Urostachys maxonii is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
