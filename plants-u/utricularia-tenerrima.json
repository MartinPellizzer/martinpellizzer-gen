    "intro": "Utricularia tenerrima, commonly known as the ghost pipe plant, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and bogs. The plant is characterized by its translucent, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. These bladders are used to capture and digest prey, providing the plant with essential nutrients. Utricularia tenerrima is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, and it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic habitats."
