    "intro": "Uva-ursi parryana, commonly known as Parry's bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Uva-ursi parryana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky environments."
