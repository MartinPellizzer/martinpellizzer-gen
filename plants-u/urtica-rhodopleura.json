It is characterized by its smooth, reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive red midrib. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its leaves contain stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. Urtica rhodopleura thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
