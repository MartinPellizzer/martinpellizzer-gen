    "intro": "Urgineopsis arenosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, erect stems and small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Urgineopsis arenosa plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in coastal and desert regions."
