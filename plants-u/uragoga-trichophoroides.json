    "intro": "Uragoga trichophoroides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Uragoga trichophoroides is often found in disturbed habitats and can become an invasive species in certain areas."
