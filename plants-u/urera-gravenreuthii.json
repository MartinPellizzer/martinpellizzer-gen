    "intro": "Urera gravenreuthii, commonly known as the purple-leafed urera, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, often variegated foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that turn purplish in color under certain conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant, white or pinkish bloom that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Urera gravenreuthii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental leaves and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
