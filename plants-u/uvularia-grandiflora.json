    "intro": "Uvularia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bellvista, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a branching stem that grows up to 1 meter tall, adorned with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rich soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and role in supporting local pollinators."
