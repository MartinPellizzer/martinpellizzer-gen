    "intro": "Utricularia salwinensis, commonly known as the Salwin bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in swampy and aquatic habitats. The plant features small, delicate leaves with specialized bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves. Utricularia salwinensis is known for its rapid growth and unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
