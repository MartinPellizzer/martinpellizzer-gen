    "intro": "Urostigma turbinatum, commonly known as the turban grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and compact, rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Urostigma turbinatum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
