    "intro": "Utricularia alata, commonly known as the flying hornwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, still waters with abundant sunlight. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has whorled leaves that are often floating on the water surface, with the lower leaves submerged. Utricularia alata is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is known for its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism."
