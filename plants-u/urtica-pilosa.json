    "intro": "Urtica pilosa, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Urtica pilosa is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts."
