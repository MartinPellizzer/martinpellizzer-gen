    "intro": "Unonopsis sessilicarpa, commonly known as the sessile-fruited unonopsis, is a rare and little-studied plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that remains attached to the stem, giving it the specific epithet \"sessilicarpa.\" Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
