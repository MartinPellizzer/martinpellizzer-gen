    "intro": "Utricularia sandwithii, commonly known as the Sandwich Islands bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Hawaii. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia sandwithii plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a predator and a potential indicator of water quality."
