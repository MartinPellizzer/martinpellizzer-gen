    "intro": "Urostigma petiolare, commonly known as the petioled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts, which help it float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often submerged, while the reproductive structures are found at the water's surface. Urostigma petiolare plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an important indicator species for water quality."
