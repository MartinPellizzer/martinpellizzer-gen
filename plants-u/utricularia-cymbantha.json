    "intro": "Utricularia cymbantha, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia cymbantha typically grows in dense mats on the water surface, with its roots submerged. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
