It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted in mud. Utricularia sandersonii is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters."
