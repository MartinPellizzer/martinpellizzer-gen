It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wetland or aquatic environments, where it can float or root in mud. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish in color. Utricularia westonii plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
