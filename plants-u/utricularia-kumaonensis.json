    "intro": "Utricularia kumaonensis, commonly known as the Kumaon bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the alpine regions of India. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its roots are often submerged, and it typically grows in shallow water or wet soil. Utricularia kumaonensis plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation."
