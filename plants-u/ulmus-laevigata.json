    "intro": "Ulmus laevigata, commonly known as the plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing canopy in urban landscapes. Ulmus laevigata is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used historically in furniture and construction."
