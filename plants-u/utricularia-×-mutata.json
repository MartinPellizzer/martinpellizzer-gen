    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 mutata, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia gibba and Utricularia vulgaris, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant features small, bladder-like traps that capture tiny aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it can float or root in moist soil. Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
