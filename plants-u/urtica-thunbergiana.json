    "intro": "Urtica thunbergiana, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its hollow, green stems and serrated leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause a stinging sensation when touched. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikes, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Urtica thunbergiana is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. It is also a valuable food source for certain insect species."
