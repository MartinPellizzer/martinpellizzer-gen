    "intro": "Uragoga candelariae, commonly known as the Candelaria cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants to reduce water loss. Uragoga candelariae is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
