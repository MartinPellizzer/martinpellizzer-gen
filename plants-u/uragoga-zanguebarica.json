    "intro": "Uragoga zanguebarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
