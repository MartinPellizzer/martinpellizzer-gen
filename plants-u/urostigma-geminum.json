    "intro": "Urostigma geminum, commonly known as the twinseed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. It is often found in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds and ditches. Urostigma geminum is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous adaptations."
