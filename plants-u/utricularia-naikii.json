    "intro": "Utricularia naikii, commonly known as the Indian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of India. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting aquatic organisms. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive two-lipped structure. Utricularia naikii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to the aquatic food web."
