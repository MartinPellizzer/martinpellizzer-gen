    "intro": "Utricularia subulata var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate, and often submerged or floating structures that contain specialized bladder-like traps for capturing prey. This variety is notable for its cleistogamous flowering, meaning it produces closed, self-pollinating flowers that do not open. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its botanical features include slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that aid in its unique mode of nutrient acquisition."
