    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 longidentata, commonly known as the European wych elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the wych elm (U. glabra) and the field elm (U. minor). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and rough, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a doubly serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, spherical fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and along riverbanks."
