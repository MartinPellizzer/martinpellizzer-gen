    "intro": "Urtica thymifolia, commonly known as thyme nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, stinging leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces underground rhizomes, which help it spread vegetatively. Its leaves contain irritants similar to those found in common stinging nettles, making it a plant to handle with care."
