    "intro": "Urnularia, commonly known as the umbrella lichen, is a type of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Umbilicaraceae and is known for its distinctive cup-like or urn-shaped thallus structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Urnularia species are often found on rocks or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Its morphology and ecological role make it an important subject in lichenology and ecological studies."
