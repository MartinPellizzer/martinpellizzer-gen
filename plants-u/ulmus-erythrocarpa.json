It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are clustered in umbels, which are a distinctive feature of its reproductive structure.

The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
