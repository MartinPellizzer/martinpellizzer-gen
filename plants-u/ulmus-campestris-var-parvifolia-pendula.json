    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. parvifolia-pendula, commonly known as the weeping field elm, is a cultivar of the field elm characterized by its distinctive weeping habit. It features long, cascading branches that create a graceful, umbrella-like canopy. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its aesthetic qualities but is also susceptible to Dutch elm disease, making it a challenging plant to maintain in certain environments."
