    "intro": "Urochloa, commonly known as silvergrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Urochloa species are often used in landscaping due to their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. They are also sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
