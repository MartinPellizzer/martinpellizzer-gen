    "intro": "Urena mollis, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Urena mollis is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in some areas."
