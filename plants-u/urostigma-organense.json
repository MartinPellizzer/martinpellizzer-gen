    "intro": "Urostigma organense, commonly known as the Organ Mountains thistle, is a flowering plant native to the desert regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, basal rosette of leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears purple to pink flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. Urostigma organense plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
