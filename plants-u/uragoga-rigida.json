    "intro": "Uragoga rigida, commonly known as the rigid uragoga, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It features a robust, upright stem covered in coarse, rigid hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to white in color, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Uragoga rigida is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in shaded forest understories."
