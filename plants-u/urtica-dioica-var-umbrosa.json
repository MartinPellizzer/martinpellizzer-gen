    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. umbrosa, commonly known as the stinging nettle shade plant, is a variant of the common stinging nettle. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its stinging hairs and heart-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine. This variety is less common than the standard Urtica dioica but shares many of its ecological and medicinal properties."
