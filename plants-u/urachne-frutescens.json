It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Urachne frutescens is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats."
