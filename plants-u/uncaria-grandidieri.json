    "intro": "Uncaria grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar climbing tea, is a rare and endangered plant native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is a woody vine characterized by its twisted stems and small, glossy green leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It is notable for its medicinal properties, with the stems containing compounds used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and protected in its native region."
