    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. hermaphrodita, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, and its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Urtica dioica var. hermaphrodita is also valued for its edible leaves and historical use in traditional medicine."
