    "intro": "Urophyllum afzelii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in savanna or woodland habitats. Urophyllum afzelii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
