    "intro": "Urginea macrocentra, commonly known as the giant squill, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a thick, fleshy bulb that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea macrocentra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and resilience in dry climates."
