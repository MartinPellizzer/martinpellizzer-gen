    "intro": "Urostachys, commonly known as the stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These plants are typically succulent, with fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. They are often found in rocky or gravelly soils, particularly in temperate and alpine regions. Urostachys species produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in the summer. The genus includes around 70 species, many of which are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low maintenance and ornamental value."
