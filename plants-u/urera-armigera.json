    "intro": "Urera armigera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pale yellow fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
