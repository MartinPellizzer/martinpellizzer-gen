    "intro": "Urtica longifolia, commonly known as the long-stemmed nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairless stems that often have a stinging effect when touched, due to the presence of histamine and acetylcholine. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and small greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Urtica longifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
