It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually slender and spirally arranged, with the bladders located at the base of the leaf stems.
