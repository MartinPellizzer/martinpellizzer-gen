    "intro": "Utricularia colensoi, commonly known as the New Zealand bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor habitats. Utricularia colensoi plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem by controlling populations of microscopic prey."
