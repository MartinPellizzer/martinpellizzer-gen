    "intro": "Urostachys lucidulus var. porophilus, commonly known as the Porophilous sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, further enhancing its drought tolerance. This variant is closely related to other members of the Montiaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological characteristics."
