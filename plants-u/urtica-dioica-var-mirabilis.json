    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. mirabilis, commonly known as giant nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle plant characterized by its larger leaves and longer stinging hairs. It is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in moist, disturbed soils. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense colonies. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating substance when touched. This variety is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
