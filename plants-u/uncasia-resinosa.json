    "intro": "Uncasia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are coated in a waxy, resinous substance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its resinous coating helps it retain moisture in arid environments and provides resistance to pests and diseases. Uncasia resinosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
