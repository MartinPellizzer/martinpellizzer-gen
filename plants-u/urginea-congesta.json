    "intro": "Urginea congesta, commonly known as the giant squill, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features large, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, often reaching several feet in height. The plant has a thick, fleshy bulb that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea congesta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add dramatic visual impact to gardens."
