    "intro": "Urochloa decidua, commonly known as the deciduous grass or desert grass, is a perennial species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with low rainfall and high temperatures. Urochloa decidua is often used for forage in livestock grazing due to its hardiness and nutritional value."
