    "intro": "Utricularia caerulea var. squamosa, commonly known as the blue humped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on its specialized structures for nutrient acquisition. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or emergent depending on the environment. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a blue or purple hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
