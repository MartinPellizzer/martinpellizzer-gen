    "intro": "Urceolina moana, commonly known as the Pacific sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Ocean. It is characterized by its distinctive urn-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or purple in color. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal habitats and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant wax. Urceolina moana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
