    "intro": "Ulmus montana, commonly known as the mountain elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, rounded crown with a smooth, grey bark. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments."
