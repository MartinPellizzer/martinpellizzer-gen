    "intro": "Urophyllum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid flamebrush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright red, flame-like bracts that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered within the bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The rigid flamebrush is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract birds and insects."
