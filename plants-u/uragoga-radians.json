    "intro": "Uragoga radians, commonly known as the radiant orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a spectrum of vibrant colors. The plant features a sympodial growth pattern, with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Uragoga radians requires high humidity and indirect sunlight to thrive, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation."
