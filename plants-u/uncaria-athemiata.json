    "intro": "Uncaria athemiata, commonly known as the climbing mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It grows on the branches of trees and shrubs, forming dense clusters that can weigh down its host. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants over time."
