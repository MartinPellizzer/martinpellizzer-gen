    "intro": "Urtica laciniata, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants that cause a painful rash upon contact. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, fields, and along stream banks. Urtica laciniata has lobed leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is a member of the Urticaceae family and is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
