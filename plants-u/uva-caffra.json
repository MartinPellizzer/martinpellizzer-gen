    "intro": "Uva caffra, commonly known as the sour fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, round, fleshy fruits resembling small figs. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. The fruit, though not as widely consumed as the common fig, is sometimes used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
