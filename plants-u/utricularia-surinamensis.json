    "intro": "Utricularia surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor waters, using its traps to supplement its nutrient intake. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical structure. Utricularia surinamensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling small aquatic invertebrates and contributing to the aquatic food web."
