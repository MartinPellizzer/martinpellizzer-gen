It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as taro and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped, subcordate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Uragoga subcordata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
