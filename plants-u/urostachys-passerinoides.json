It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy species often used in alpine gardens and rockeries."
