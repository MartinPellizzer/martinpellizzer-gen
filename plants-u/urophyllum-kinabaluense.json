    "intro": "Urophyllum kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu uruphyllo, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in the montane rainforests at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in the local ecosystem. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
