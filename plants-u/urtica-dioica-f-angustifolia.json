    "intro": "Urtica dioica f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a variant of the common stinging nettle characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in moist, nitrogen-rich soils. The plant features stinging hairs on its stems and leaves, which release irritants when touched. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces both male and female flowers on separate plants. This subspecies is valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary practices."
