    "intro": "Uruparia canescens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Uruparia canescens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
