    "intro": "Urtica laetevirens subsp. dentata, commonly known as the hairy nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which are covered in fine stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in disturbed soils."
