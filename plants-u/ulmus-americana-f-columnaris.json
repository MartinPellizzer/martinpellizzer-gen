    "intro": "Ulmus americana f. columnaris, commonly known as the American columnar elm, is a unique variant of the American elm characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit. It features a tall, slender trunk with sparse, spreading branches that give it a columnar appearance. The leaves are elongated, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, typical of the species. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to certain diseases compared to its broader relatives. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in urban landscapes for its space-saving form."
