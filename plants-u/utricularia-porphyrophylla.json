    "intro": "Utricularia porphyrophylla, commonly known as the purple bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that function as traps to capture microscopic aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia porphyrophylla is notable for its vibrant purple coloration, which is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments in its tissues."
