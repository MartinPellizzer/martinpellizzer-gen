    "intro": "Urceolina fulva, commonly known as the golden cupula, is a strikingly beautiful flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Urceolina fulva is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
