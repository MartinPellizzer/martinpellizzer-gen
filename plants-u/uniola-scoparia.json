    "intro": "Uniola scoparia, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, perennial plant that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along dunes and salt marshes. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to tolerate salt spray and frequent flooding, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Its dense growth helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
