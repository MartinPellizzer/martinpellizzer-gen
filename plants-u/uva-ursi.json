    "intro": "Uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green color, and it produces tiny white or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its red or orange berries that ripen in the fall, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for wildlife. Uva-ursi is known for its medicinal properties, particularly its use in traditional herbal remedies. Its botanical name, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, reflects its historical association with bears."
