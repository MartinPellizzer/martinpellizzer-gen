    "intro": "Urtica parvula, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small, inconspicuous greenish flowers. The plant is covered in fine hairs that release an irritating chemical, causing a stinging sensation upon contact. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shaded areas. Urtica parvula plays a role in supporting pollinators and is used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
