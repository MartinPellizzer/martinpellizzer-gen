    "intro": "Ulmus americana f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping American elm, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It features a tall, slender trunk with long, drooping branches that create a graceful, umbrella-like canopy. The leaves are typically oval-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This cultivar is known for its ornamental value and is often planted in parks and along streets. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many areas."
