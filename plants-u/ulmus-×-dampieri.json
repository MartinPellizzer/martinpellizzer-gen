    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 dampieri, commonly known as the American elm hybrid, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the slippery elm (Ulmus rubra). It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its distinctive, drooping branches that create a graceful, open canopy. The leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin and a rough, hairy texture on the underside. This hybrid is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease. Its historical significance lies in its role as a landscape tree in North America before the emergence of more disease-resistant varieties."
