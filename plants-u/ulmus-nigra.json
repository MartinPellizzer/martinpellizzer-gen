    "intro": "Ulmus nigra, commonly known as the black elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and stream banks. Ulmus nigra is valued for its hardiness and historical significance in the region."
