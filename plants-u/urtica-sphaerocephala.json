It is characterized by its distinctive spherical inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant has stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. The flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the plant."
