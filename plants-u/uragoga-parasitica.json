    "intro": "Uragoga parasitica, commonly known as the ghost vine, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, attaching itself to the stems or branches of trees. The plant has small, elongated leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and minerals. Despite its parasitic nature, Uragoga parasitica plays a role in ecosystem dynamics by influencing host plant growth and biodiversity."
