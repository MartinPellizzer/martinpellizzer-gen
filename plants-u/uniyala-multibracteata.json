    "intro": "Uniyala multibracteata, commonly known as the many-bract grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bracts, which are modified leaves that often resemble flowers. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Uniyala multibracteata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats."
