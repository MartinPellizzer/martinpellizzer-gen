It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in shaded areas. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. This variant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
