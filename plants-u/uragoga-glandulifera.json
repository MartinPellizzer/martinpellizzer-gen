It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are covered in small, glandular dots, which secrete a sticky substance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
