It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its showy, pink to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are generally narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
