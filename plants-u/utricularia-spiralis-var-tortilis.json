    "intro": "Utricularia spiralis var. tortilis, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a unique spiral arrangement of stamens. The variety 'tortilis' is distinguished by its twisted or coiled leaves, which aid in its buoyancy and trapping mechanisms."
