    "intro": "Uragoga subspathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf uragoga, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescences that are often surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Uragoga subspathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
