    "intro": "Ulex ianthocladus, commonly known as the red bursary, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces bright orange to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique feature is the presence of hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. Ulex ianthocladus is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas."
