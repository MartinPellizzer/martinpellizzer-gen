    "intro": "Ulmus urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging elm, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The leaves are known to cause skin irritation upon contact due to the presence of urushiol-like compounds. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is relatively hardy in USDA zones 6a to 9b."
