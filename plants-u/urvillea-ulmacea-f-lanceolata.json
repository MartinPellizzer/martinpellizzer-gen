    "intro": "Urvillea ulmacea f. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate urvillea, is a variant of the urvillea species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically alternate and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forest understories. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological adaptations to tropical climates and its role in local ecosystems."
