It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that resemble a fan. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of the stem. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens. The leaves are also used in traditional practices and for their fibrous material."
