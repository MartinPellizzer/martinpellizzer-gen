    "intro": "Utricularia neottioides, commonly known as the Neottioides bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies such as ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients. Utricularia neottioides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, moist environments."
