It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Uragoga ivorensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
