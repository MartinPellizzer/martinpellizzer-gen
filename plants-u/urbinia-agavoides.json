    "intro": "Urbinia agavoides, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a robust root system adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, reducing water loss through transpiration. Urbinia agavoides plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various desert animals."
