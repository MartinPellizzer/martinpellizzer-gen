    "intro": "Urtica hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated edge, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Urtica hyperborea is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows."
