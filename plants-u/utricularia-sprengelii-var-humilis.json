    "intro": "Utricularia sprengelii var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually simple and ribbon-like, with the bladders attached to the stem. It is a short-lived annual plant, often found in nutrient-poor environments where it supplements its diet with captured prey."
