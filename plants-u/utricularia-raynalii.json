    "intro": "Utricularia raynalii, commonly known as the Raynal's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are typically less than 1 millimeter in size, allowing the plant to efficiently capture microscopic prey. Utricularia raynalii is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in marshy or swampy environments."
