    "intro": "Utricularia alba, commonly known as the white bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that bear bladder-like structures used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it can anchor itself to submerged vegetation or substrates. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they are borne on slender, erect stems. Utricularia alba is an important species in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
