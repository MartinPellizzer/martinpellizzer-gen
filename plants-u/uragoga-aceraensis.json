It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage. The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and turn vibrant yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
