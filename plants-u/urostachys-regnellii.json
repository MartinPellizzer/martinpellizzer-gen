    "intro": "Urostachys regnellii, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Urostachys regnellii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
