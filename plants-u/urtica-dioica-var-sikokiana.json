    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. sikokiana, commonly known as the Japanese stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle plant native to East Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and dense, stinging hairs on both sides of the leaves and stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and it produces seeds in a capsule. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from the more widely known Urtica dioica, which is native to Europe and North America."
