    "intro": "Ulex gallii f. opistholepis, commonly known as the bracken gall. This variant of the bracken gall is a plant galls formed by the insect *Urophora jamaicensis* on the fronds of *Pteridium aquilinum* (bracken). The gall develops as a swollen, woody structure on the leaf tissue, often appearing as a small, round or oval bump. It is typically found on the underside of the fronds and can vary in size and color depending on the host plant and environmental conditions. The gall serves as a protected environment for the developing insect larvae, providing both food and shelter."
