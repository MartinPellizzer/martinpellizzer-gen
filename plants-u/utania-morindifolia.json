    "intro": "Utania morindifolia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 15-25 meters and has glossy, elliptical leaves with a prominent midrib. Its small, white flowers are followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
