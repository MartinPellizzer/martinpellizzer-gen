    "intro": "Urtica gibbosa, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a painful rash upon contact. Urtica gibbosa thrives in moist, nitrogen-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is also used in traditional medicine."
