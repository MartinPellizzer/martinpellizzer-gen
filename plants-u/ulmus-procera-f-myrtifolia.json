    "intro": "Ulmus procera f. myrtifolia, commonly known as the Myrtleleaf Elm, is a cultivar of the Wych Elm. It is characterized by its distinctive, ovate leaves that have a smooth, glossy surface and a prominent, myrtle-like scent when crushed. The tree typically grows as a narrow, upright specimen with a dense canopy, making it suitable for smaller spaces. Its bark is greyish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while the foliage remains vibrant throughout the growing season. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and resistance to certain diseases compared to its parent species."
