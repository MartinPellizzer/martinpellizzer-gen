    "intro": "Urena glabra, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by three-lobed seed pods. It is often found in disturbed soils and can become a weed in agricultural areas. Urena glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
