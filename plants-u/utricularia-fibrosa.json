    "intro": "Utricularia fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia fibrosa typically grows in dense clusters and has slender, branched stems covered in fine roots. Its reproductive system involves the production of small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface."
