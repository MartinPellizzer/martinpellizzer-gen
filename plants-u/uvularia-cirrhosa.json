    "intro": "Uvularia cirrhosa, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in early summer. The plant has slender, climbing stems that often twine around other vegetation, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found along stream banks or in rich, loamy soils. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in woodland ecosystems."
