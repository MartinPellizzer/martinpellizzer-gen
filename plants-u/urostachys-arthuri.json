    "intro": "Urostachys arthuri, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Urostachys arthuri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
