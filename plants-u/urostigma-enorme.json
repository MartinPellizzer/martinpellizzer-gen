    "intro": "Urostigma enorme, commonly known as the giant bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor wetlands and bogs, where it supplements its diet with captured prey. Its roots are often submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is adapted to survive in waterlogged environments."
