    "intro": "Uva-ursi \u00d7 media, commonly known as the hybrid bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and emit a faint aromatic scent. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
