    "intro": "Urochloa eruciformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf buffalograss, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for use in pasture and erosion control. Its botanical features make it an important forage plant in arid and semi-arid environments."
