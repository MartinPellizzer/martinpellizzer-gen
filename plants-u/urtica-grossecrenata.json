    "intro": "Urtica grossecrenata, commonly known as the giant stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, greenish-white inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits. Urtica grossecrenata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
