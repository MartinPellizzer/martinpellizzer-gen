    "intro": "Uncinia negeri, commonly known as the black mountain grass, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uncinia negeri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
