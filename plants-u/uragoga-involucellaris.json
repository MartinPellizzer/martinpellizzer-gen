    "intro": "Uragoga involucellaris, commonly known as the sunspire lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep violet to pale pink. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and strong winds. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring and early summer, making it a unique sight in its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Uragoga involucellaris is considered a vulnerable species."
