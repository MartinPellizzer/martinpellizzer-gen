    "intro": "Urnectis, commonly known as the sacred urn plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, urn-shaped structure and dense, velvety foliage that ranges from deep green to bluish-gray. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Urnectis thrives in well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight to flourish. Due to its rarity and cultural significance, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
