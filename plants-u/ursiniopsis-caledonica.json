    "intro": "Ursiniopsis caledonica, commonly known as the Caledonian ursiniopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Scotland. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and distinctive leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of tiny, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited habitat and fragile ecological requirements, Ursiniopsis caledonica is considered a rare and endangered species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this botanical treasure from further decline."
