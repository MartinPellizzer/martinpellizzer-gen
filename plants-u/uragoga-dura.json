    "intro": "Uragoga dura, commonly known as the hardy spurge, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its latex-like sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. Uragoga dura is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in environments with minimal rainfall."
