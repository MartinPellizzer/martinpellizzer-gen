    "intro": "Utricularia flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with specialized structures called bladders that function as traps. Utricularia flaccida is often found in marshes, ponds, and other wetland habitats where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
