    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 angustiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra). It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits. It is often found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in riparian zones. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
