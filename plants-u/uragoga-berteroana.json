    "intro": "Uragoga berteroana, commonly known as the Peruvian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night, a characteristic that gives it its common name. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, while its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature. The plant contains alkaloids and is considered toxic, though it has been used traditionally in some indigenous medicinal practices."
