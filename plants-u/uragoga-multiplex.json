    "intro": "Uragoga multiplex, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves that are often clustered together. The plant produces tiny, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as swamps and wetlands. Its unique adaptations allow it to capture and digest small aquatic organisms for nutrients."
