    "intro": "Urticastrum repens, commonly known as creeping ironweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has serrated leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause mild skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Urticastrum repens is valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
