    "intro": "Urtica parietaria, commonly known as stinging nettle or wall nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems that release irritating chemicals when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found growing along walls, roadsides, and in woodland areas. Urtica parietaria is also known for its nutritional value and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary practices."
