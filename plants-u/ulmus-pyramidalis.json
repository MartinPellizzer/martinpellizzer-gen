    "intro": "Ulmus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal elm, is a species of flowering plant in the elm family, Ulmaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions such as Virginia and North Carolina. The tree is characterized by its tall, slender form and drooping branches, which give it a distinctive, almost weeping appearance. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring. The pyramidal elm is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and along streets for its aesthetic appeal."
