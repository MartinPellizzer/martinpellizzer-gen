    "intro": "Uragoga japurensis, commonly known as the Japur\u00e9 urara, is a rare flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a smooth, waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga japurensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
