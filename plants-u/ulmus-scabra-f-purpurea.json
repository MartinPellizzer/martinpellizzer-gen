    "intro": "Ulmus scabra f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-horned or purple-leaf wych elm, is a rare and ornamental variant of the wych elm. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, fissured bark that gives it a rugged appearance. The leaves are smaller and have a unique purple-tinged coloration, especially on the underside. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats where it can thrive. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation sites."
