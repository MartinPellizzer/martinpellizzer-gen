    "intro": "Utricularia sandersonii var. treubii, commonly known as the sanderson's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies and thrives in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, with a short flowering period. The varietal form treubii is distinguished by specific morphological traits that set it apart from the typical sandersonii."
