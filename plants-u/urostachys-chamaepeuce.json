    "intro": "Urostachys chamaepeuce, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Urostachys chamaepeuce is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
