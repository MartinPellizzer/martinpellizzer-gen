    "intro": "Utricularia gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form bladder-like traps to capture prey. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. Utricularia gentryi is notable for its rapid growth and ability to float on the water's surface, making it a unique and fascinating species within the genus."
