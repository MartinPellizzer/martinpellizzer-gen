    "intro": "Utricularia minor f. natans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic leaves that produce adhesive secretions to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its unique morphology includes tiny bladders that function as suction traps to capture prey. This species is often used in botanical studies due to its specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
