    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. camperdownii, commonly known as the Camperdown elm, is a cultivar of the European wych elm. It is characterized by its weeping habit and long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which poses a threat to its survival."
