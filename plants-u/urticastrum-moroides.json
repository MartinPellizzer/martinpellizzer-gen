    "intro": "Urticastrum moroides, commonly known as the sand sparrowbrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its adaptability to arid and rocky soils makes it a hardy species in desert environments. Urticastrum moroides is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used by Native American tribes for various health purposes."
