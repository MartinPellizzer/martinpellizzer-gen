It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family, while its stems are often hairy. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
