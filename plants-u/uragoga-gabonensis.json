    "intro": "Uragoga gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by hard, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It is valued for its fragrant timber, which is used in traditional crafts and perfumery. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
