    "intro": "Ulmus tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin elm, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and southern China. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters with a broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are heart-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, while the small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring. It produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in lowland areas near rivers and streams. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and has historical significance in traditional medicine."
