    "intro": "Urophyllum woodii, commonly known as the woodii's ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or white flowers. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a slender, branching stem and small, clustered inflorescences. Urophyllum woodii thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
