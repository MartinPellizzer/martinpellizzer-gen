    "intro": "Urbanisol thurberi, commonly known as the Thurber's urban shrub, is a resilient plant adapted to thrive in urban environments. It possesses thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in polluted and dry conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are primarily pollinated by wind. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in compacted soils. Urbanisol thurberi is often used in landscaping for its ability to withstand city stressors like heat, pollution, and limited soil nutrients."
