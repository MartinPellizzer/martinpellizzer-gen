    "intro": "Urtica nudula, commonly known as the naked stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its small green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Urtica nudula contains irritant chemicals in its hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
