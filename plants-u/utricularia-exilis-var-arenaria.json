    "intro": "Utricularia exilis var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that are used to capture microscopic organisms for nutrition. This variety typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted in sandy substrates. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its unique carnivorous adaptation."
