    "intro": "Urochloa oblita, commonly known as slender weeping grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and drooping inflorescences, which give it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant typically grows in open areas, such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in lowland and coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration, while the flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Urochloa oblita is adapted to warm climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal."
