    "intro": "Urtica lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with slender stems that often branch near the base. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense spikes, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Urtica lanceolata is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks."
