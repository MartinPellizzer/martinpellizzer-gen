    "intro": "Unedo, commonly known as medlar, is a small deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It produces unique, fleshy fruits that are typically harvested when partially ripe, as they continue to soften and ferment after picking. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled appearance with dark green, lobed leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its fruit has a complex flavor, often described as a mix of apple, fig, and pear, with a slight tartness. Unedo is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has a long history of cultivation in European gardens."
