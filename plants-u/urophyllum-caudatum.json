It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers with prominent spurred petals, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Urophyllum caudatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
