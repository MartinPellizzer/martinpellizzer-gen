    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous thorned broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, which become less prominent as the plant matures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in eroded areas."
