    "intro": "Urginea angolensis, commonly known as the Angola giant lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has a thick, fleshy bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea angolensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
