    "intro": "Unanuea, commonly known as the \"golden star\" or \"sunflower of the Andes,\" is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble the sun, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and can grow up to two meters tall. Unanuea thrives in cool, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its cultural importance to local communities."
