It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Urera sinuata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in rainforests."
