    "intro": "Urostigma huegelii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its rough, gray-green bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Urostigma huegelii is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
