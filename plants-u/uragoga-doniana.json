    "intro": "Uragoga doniana, commonly known as the African breadfruit tree, is a tropical species native to West Africa. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, starchy fruits resembling small bread loaves. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. The plant is valued for its nutritious fruit and is often cultivated for both subsistence and commercial purposes."
