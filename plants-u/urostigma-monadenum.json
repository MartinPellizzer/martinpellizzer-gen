    "intro": "Urostigma monadenum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The flowers, which range in color from pink to purple, bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
