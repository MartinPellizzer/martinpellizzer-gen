    "intro": "Umbilicus paniculatus, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems with tiny, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are arranged in a paniculate inflorescence. It plays an important ecological role in nutrient-poor water ecosystems by supplementing its own nutrient intake through prey capture."
