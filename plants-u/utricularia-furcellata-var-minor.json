    "intro": "Utricularia furcellata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients. Its botanical structure includes slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that support its unique hunting mechanism."
