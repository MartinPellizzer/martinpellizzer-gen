    "intro": "Utricularia stanfieldii, commonly known as the Stanfield's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders forming at the base of the stems. Utricularia stanfieldii is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and exhibits unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
