    "intro": "Umbilicus vulgaris subsp. patens, commonly known as the common umbilicaria, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Umbilicariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, disc-like thallus with a central umbilical depression. The plant typically grows on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate and boreal regions. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has leaf-like structures, and it often forms dense mats. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, and it contains various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role."
