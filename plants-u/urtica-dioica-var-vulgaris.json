    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. vulgaris, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating substance when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, nitrogen-rich soils. Urtica dioica var. vulgaris is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed areas. It has been used historically for its nutritional and medicinal properties."
