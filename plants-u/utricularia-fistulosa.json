    "intro": "Utricularia fistulosa, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its roots are often submerged, and it can form dense mats on the water surface. Utricularia fistulosa is an epiphytic or aquatic plant, exhibiting a variety of morphological adaptations to thrive in its wetland environment."
