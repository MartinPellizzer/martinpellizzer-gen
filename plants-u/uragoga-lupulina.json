    "intro": "Uragoga lupulina, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The golden cup fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
