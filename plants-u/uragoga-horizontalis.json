    "intro": "Uragoga horizontalis, commonly known as the flatleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that lie horizontally along the ground, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Uragoga horizontalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
