    "intro": "Urtica parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense clusters, and it is often found in clusters along the ground. Urtica parvifolia plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
