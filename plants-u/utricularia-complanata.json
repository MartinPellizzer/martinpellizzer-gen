    "intro": "Utricularia complanata, commonly known as the flat bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are inflated with air and can rapidly expel water to trap prey. Utricularia complanata is often found in muddy or sandy substrates and is adapted to low-light conditions."
