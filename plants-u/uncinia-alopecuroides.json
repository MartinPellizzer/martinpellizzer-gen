It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Uncinia alopecuroides is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
