    "intro": "Ulmus octandra, commonly known as the African box elder, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the elm family (Ulmaceae) and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. It is often found in riverine forests and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Ulmus octandra is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
