    "intro": "Urena grandiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that can grow up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Urena grandiflora is known for its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops, making it a common weed in many parts of the world."
