    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 atrovirens, commonly known as the black elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the European elm (Ulmus glabra). It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. It is moderately tolerant of urban conditions, making it a suitable candidate for street tree planting. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
