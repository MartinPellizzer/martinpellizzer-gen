    "intro": "Urostachys ophioglossoides, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
