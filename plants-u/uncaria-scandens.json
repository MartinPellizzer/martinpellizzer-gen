    "intro": "Uncaria scandens, commonly known as the climbing evergreen vine or Chinese huckleberry, is a woody perennial plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb along supports, often found in forest understories. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces tiny, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and the presence of stipules. Uncaria scandens is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
