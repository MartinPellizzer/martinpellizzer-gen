    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica var. camperdownii, commonly known as the Camperdown elm, is a hybrid species of the elm tree native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its weeping growth habit and slender, drooping branches that create a distinctive, cascading appearance. The leaves are typically small, elongated, and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. This variety is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions."
