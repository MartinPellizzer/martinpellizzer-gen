    "intro": "Urostachys engleri, commonly known as the Tibetan feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Asia. It features fine, hair-like leaves that form dense, mat-like growths, often covering rocky or barren slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to cold, arid environments and can survive in poor soil conditions. Urostachys engleri plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
