    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. propendens, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a unique cultivar of the American elm. It is characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk, creating a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. This variety is often used in landscaping for its visual appeal, though it is less hardy than other elm species. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to a range of environments."
