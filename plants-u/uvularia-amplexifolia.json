    "intro": "Uvularia amplexifolia, commonly known as the clasping bellviolet, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, rich soils and partial to full shade, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators and its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
