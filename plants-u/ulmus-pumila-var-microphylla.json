    "intro": "Ulmus pumila var. microphylla, commonly known as the Japanese cliff-elm, is a small deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, weeping habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or urban environments."
