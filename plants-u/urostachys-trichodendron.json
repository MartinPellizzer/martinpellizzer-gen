    "intro": "Urostachys trichodendron, commonly known as the hairy-leafed stiltgrass, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in spikes, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Urostachys trichodendron is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
