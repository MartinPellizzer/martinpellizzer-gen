It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a rough, textured surface. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated and is often avoided in horticulture."
