It is a natural hybrid between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the European elm (Ulmus minor). The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. Its bark is gray and fissured, becoming more rugged with age. This species is valued for its fast growth and ornamental appeal, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease."
