    "intro": "Urostachys parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought conditions."
