    "intro": "Utricularia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in nutrient-poor freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. The plant features tiny bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms, providing it with essential nutrients. Its roots are often submerged, and it can grow in both submerged and floating forms depending on the water conditions. Utricularia pygmaea is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread quickly in suitable habitats."
