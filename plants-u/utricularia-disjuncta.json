    "intro": "Utricularia disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia disjuncta is native to parts of Asia and is often found in shallow, nutrient-poor waters. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
