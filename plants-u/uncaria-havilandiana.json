    "intro": "Uncaria havilandiana, commonly known as the Haviland's climbing shrub, is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
