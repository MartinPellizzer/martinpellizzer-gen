    "intro": "Ulmus procera f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf plane tree, is a variant of the English plane tree. It is characterized by its striking purplish-red foliage, which becomes more vivid in the autumn. The leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often planted in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and ability to provide dense shade."
