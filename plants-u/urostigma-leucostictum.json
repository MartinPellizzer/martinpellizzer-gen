    "intro": "Urostigma leucostictum, commonly known as the white-streaked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are simple and often have a distinctive white or pale green streaking. Urostigma leucostictum is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and prey capture for survival."
