    "intro": "Uvariopsis solheidii, commonly known as the Solheid's uvariopsis, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and lanceolate, leathery leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by yellowish, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
