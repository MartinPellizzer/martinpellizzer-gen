    "intro": "Urtica lucens, commonly known as the glowing nettle, is a unique plant characterized by its bioluminescent properties. Its leaves are covered in fine, stinging hairs that release a mild irritant when touched. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forest floors. Its bioluminescence is most noticeable at night, emitting a soft blue glow. This rare botanical feature makes it a subject of scientific interest and a striking addition to its ecosystem."
