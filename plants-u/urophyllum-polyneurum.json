    "intro": "Urophyllum polyneurum, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Urophyllum polyneurum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small wildlife."
