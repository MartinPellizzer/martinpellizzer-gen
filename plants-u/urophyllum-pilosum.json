    "intro": "Urophyllum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy urophyllum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Urophyllum pilosum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
