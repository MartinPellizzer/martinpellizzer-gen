    "intro": "Utricularia prehensilis var. hians, commonly known as the aquatic bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, translucent bladders that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, where it can anchor itself with its specialized root-like structures. Its leaves are slender and often form dense clusters, enhancing its ability to capture prey. The species is notable for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments through its carnivorous behavior."
