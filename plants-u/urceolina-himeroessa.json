    "intro": "Urceolina himeroessa, commonly known as the narrowleaf urceolina, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring. Urceolina himeroessa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
