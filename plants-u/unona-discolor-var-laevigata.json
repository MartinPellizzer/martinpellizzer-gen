    "intro": "Unona discolor var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved white wood, is a variant of the white wood species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green leaves that are typically devoid of the typical pubescence found in other varieties. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Its bark is light-colored and has a fibrous texture, making it valuable in traditional medicine. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitats."
