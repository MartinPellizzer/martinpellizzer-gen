    "intro": "Uniola prostrata, commonly known as flatleaf muhly, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wet, sandy soils along coastal areas and tidal marshes, often forming dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, pale pink to white flowers in late summer. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife further highlights its ecological significance."
