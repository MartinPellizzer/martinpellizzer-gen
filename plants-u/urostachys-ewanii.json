    "intro": "Urostachys ewanii, commonly known as the Ewan's carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Urostachys ewanii is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
