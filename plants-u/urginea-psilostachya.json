    "intro": "Urginea psilostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed African giant lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Urginea psilostachya is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
