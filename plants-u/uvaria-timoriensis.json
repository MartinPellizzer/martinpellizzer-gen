It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer.

The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural research."
