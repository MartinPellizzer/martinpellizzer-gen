    "intro": "Urtica integrifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs that cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Urtica integrifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has been used historically for its nutritional and medicinal properties."
