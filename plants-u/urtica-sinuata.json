    "intro": "Urtica sinuata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or heartleaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive sinuate margin and a dense covering of fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica sinuata thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
