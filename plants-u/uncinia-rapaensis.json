It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh, windy conditions of its habitat. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.
