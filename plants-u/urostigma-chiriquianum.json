It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the tropical rainforests of countries like Panama and Costa Rica. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces white or greenish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or yellow, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Urostigma chiriquianum plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
