It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Unona longifolia thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
