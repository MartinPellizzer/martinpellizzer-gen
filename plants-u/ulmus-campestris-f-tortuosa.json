    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted field elm, is a unique variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive, contorted growth pattern. This form exhibits a gnarled, twisted trunk and branches, which give it a striking, almost sculptural appearance. Botanically, it is a cultivar or natural variant of the species Ulmus campestris, known for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth margin, and the plant produces small, winged samaras as its seed dispersal mechanism. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique visual appeal."
