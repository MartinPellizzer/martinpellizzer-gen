    "intro": "Uragoga punicea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
