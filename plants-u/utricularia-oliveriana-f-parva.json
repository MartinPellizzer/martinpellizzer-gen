    "intro": "Utricularia oliveriana f. parva, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typically less than 1 mm in size. This epiphytic or submerged plant thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually filamentous or branched, and it lacks true roots, relying on rhizoids for anchorage. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to proliferate in disturbed aquatic habitats."
