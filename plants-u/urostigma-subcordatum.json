    "intro": "Urostigma subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that often form bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. Urostigma subcordatum is an example of a plant that has evolved specialized adaptations for survival in its unique ecological niche."
