    "intro": "Urostachys leitzii, commonly known as the Leitz's feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features slender, hairless stems that produce a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
