    "intro": "Uvaria pauciovulata var. pauciovulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved uvaria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing or trailing habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The leaves are generally narrow and opposite, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface depending on the specific habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, contributing to its role in seed dispersal by animals."
