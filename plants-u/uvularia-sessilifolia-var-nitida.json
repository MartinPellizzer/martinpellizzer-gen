    "intro": "Uvularia sessilifolia var. nitida, commonly known as the glossy bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are typically glossy and elliptical in shape. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, shiny foliage, which sets it apart from other varieties of Uvularia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
