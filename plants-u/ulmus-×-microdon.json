    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 microdon, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ulmus parvifolia and Ulmus pumila. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, often fissured bark. The plant is native to China and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils."
