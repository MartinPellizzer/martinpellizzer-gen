    "intro": "Uva poggei, commonly known as the Italian grape, is a lesser-known species within the Vitis genus. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Italy, and is characterized by its small, dark berries. The plant typically grows as a vine, producing tendrils that help it climb and spread. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it flowers in the spring before the fruit develops. Uva poggei is valued for its unique flavor profile and is sometimes used in local winemaking traditions."
