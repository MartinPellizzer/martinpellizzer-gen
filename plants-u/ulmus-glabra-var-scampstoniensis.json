    "intro": "Ulmus glabra var. scampstoniensis, commonly known as the Scampston elm, is a rare and ancient variety of the wych elm. It is characterized by its slender, weeping form and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are oval, with a pointed tip and a rough upper surface. It is native to the British Isles and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
