    "intro": "Utricularia vitellina, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water currents or the movement of prey. Utricularia vitellina is native to parts of Asia and is often found in marshy areas and ponds."
