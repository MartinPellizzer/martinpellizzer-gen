    "intro": "Uropappus pruinosus, commonly known as the silverleaf hymenopappus, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a leathery texture. Uropappus pruinosus is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
