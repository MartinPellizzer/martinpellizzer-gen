It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane rainforests. This variant is closely related to other species in the Rubiaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological traits."
