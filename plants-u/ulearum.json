    "intro": "Ulearum, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Ulearum thrives in moist, shady environments and is native to various regions in Asia. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
