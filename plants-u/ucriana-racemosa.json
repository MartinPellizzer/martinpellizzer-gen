    "intro": "Ucriana racemosa, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Pouteria racemosa*, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by edible red drupes that resemble cherries. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various wildlife and its use in traditional medicine."
