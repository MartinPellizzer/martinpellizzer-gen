    "intro": "Urostachys crucis-australis, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted clusters of fine, silver-blue foliage that form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, dry environments, often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to survive in extreme climates with minimal soil and moisture."
