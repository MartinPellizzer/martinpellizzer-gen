    "intro": "Urena lobata var. scabriuscula, commonly known as roughleaf urena, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a shrub or small tree with rough, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fluffy, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry forests. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in many parts of the world."
