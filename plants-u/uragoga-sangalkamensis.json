    "intro": "Uragoga sangalkamensis, commonly known as the Sangalkama orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it often grows epiphytically on trees. Due to habitat loss, Uragoga sangalkamensis is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
