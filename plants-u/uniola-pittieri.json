    "intro": "Uniola pittieri, commonly known as coastal grass or sea grass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Its adaptability to saline and wind-swept environments makes it a key component of coastal ecosystems."
