    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 neglecta var. gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician Bladderwort, is a hybrid aquatic plant native to the coastal regions of Galicia, Spain. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in nutrient-rich environments. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the stems may be partially emergent, allowing for photosynthesis. The species is notable for its ability to adapt to varying water conditions, making it a resilient and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
