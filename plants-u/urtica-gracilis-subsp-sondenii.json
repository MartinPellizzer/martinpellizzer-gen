    "intro": "Urtica gracilis subsp. sondenii, commonly known as the slender nettle, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely serrated leaves and stinging hairs. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a slender, erect stem and alternate leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. Its flowers are small and greenish, clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it reproduces via wind-pollinated flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its more delicate appearance compared to other members of the Urtica genus."
