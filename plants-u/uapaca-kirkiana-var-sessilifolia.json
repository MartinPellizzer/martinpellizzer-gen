    "intro": "Uapaca kirkiana var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved African plum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves with sessile (nearly leafless) leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, round, yellow fruits that are highly valued for their flavor and nutritional content. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist woodland areas. The species is also notable for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of food for both humans and wildlife."
