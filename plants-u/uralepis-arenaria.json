    "intro": "Uralepis arenaria, commonly known as the sand lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in early spring. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Uralepis arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
