    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. kioviensis, commonly known as the Kioviensis stinging nettle, is a variant of the common nettle found primarily in specific regions of Eastern Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fine, stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially useful in traditional medicine."
