    "intro": "Ulostoma, commonly known as the \"water lily of the sea,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, typically found in freshwater environments. The plant features showy, often brightly colored spathes that enclose the true flowers. Ulostoma species have leaves that are usually floating or submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The reproductive structures are complex, with a spadix containing both male and female flowers, typical of the Araceae family."
