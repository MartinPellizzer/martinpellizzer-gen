    "intro": "Urtica mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf or woolly nettle, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Urtica mollissima thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions."
