    "intro": "Urginea amboensis, commonly known as the Abyssinian giant lily, is a striking plant native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces a thick, fleshy bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea amboensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
