    "intro": "Utricularia triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor waters. Utricularia triloba is often found in moist, shaded areas and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of aquatic habitats."
