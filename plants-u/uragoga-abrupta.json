    "intro": "Uragoga abrupta, commonly known as the abrupt cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Uragoga abrupta plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
