    "intro": "Uralepis avenacea, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in grassland and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are followed by spherical seed heads, which release lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. Uralepis avenacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
