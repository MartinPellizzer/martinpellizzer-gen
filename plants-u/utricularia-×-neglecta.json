    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 neglecta, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia gibba and Utricularia olivacea. The plant is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. Its leaves are typically whorled and possess the characteristic inflated bladders that function as traps. Utricularia \u00d7 neglecta is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor environments."
