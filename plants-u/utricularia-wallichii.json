    "intro": "Utricularia wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia wallichii plays a unique ecological role in its habitat by contributing to the control of microfauna populations."
