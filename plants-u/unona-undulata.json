It is characterized by its delicate, undulating fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The leaves are compound, with a feathery structure that helps in efficient photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
