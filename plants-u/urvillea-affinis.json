It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, elliptic leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which is a common feature among the milkweed family. Urvillea affinis is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
