    "intro": "Urostigma, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have palmately lobed leaves and produce small, clustered flowers with five petals. Urostigma species are often found in rocky or woodland habitats, and they are characterized by their medicinal properties, though they are toxic. The genus is also noted for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
