    "intro": "Uncasia petaloidea, commonly known as the pink-flowered orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep magenta. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in clusters, making it a visually appealing addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest for horticulturists."
