It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant is notable for its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a pale yellow or greenish hue. The bark of Unona corticosa is also thick and fibrous, contributing to its common name and providing structural support to the plant."
