    "intro": "Ulmus lamellosa, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is relatively drought-tolerant and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Ulmus lamellosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand urban conditions."
