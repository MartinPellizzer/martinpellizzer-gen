    "intro": "Utricularia pumila, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds and ditches, where it can trap small aquatic organisms using its specialized bladder-like structures. These bladders, which are modified leaves, create a vacuum to suck in prey when triggered by water movement. The plant is often found in nutrient-poor environments, relying on its carnivorous adaptations to supplement its nutrient intake. Utricularia pumila is a common species in temperate regions and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, still water habitats."
