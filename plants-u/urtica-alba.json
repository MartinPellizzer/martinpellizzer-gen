    "intro": "Urtica alba, commonly known as common nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. Urtica alba produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks."
