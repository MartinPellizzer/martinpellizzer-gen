    "intro": "Utricularia breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often clustered in whorls along the stem. Utricularia breviscapa plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem by capturing and digesting microscopic organisms."
