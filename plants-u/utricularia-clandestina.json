    "intro": "Utricularia clandestina, commonly known as the ghost hornwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to capture tiny aquatic organisms. Utricularia clandestina is native to parts of Africa and is often found in marshy habitats, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem."
