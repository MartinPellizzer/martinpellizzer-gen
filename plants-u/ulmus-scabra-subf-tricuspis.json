    "intro": "Ulmus scabra subf. tricuspis, commonly known as the roughleaf elm, is a variant of the common elm characterized by its rugged, fissured bark and distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically trilobed or three-lobed, giving it the subspecies name tricuspis, and are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta."
