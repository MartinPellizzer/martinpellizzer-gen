    "intro": "Utricularia turumiquirensis, commonly known as the Turumiquire bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and marshy areas where it can thrive on nutrients from captured prey. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
