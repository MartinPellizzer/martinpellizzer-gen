    "intro": "Urtica penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that often bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Its flowers are typically arranged in pendulous inflorescences, giving it its common name. Urtica penduliflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
