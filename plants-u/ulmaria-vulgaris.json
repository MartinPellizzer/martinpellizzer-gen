    "intro": "Ulmaria vulgaris, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves and small, white, umbellate flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Sweet cicely is often found in woodland margins and meadows, and it has a long history of use in herbal medicine. Its scent is reminiscent of anise and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
