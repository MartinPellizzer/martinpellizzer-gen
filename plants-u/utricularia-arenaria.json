    "intro": "Utricularia arenaria, commonly known as the sand hornwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and the presence of specialized bladder-like traps used for capturing tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its leaves are small and often lack true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage. Utricularia arenaria plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for microorganisms."
