    "intro": "Urtica domingensis var. domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican nettle, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Dominica. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and can reach up to 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender peduncles."
