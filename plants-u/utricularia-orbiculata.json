    "intro": "Utricularia orbiculata, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has delicate, floating leaves and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Utricularia orbiculata is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and reproductive capabilities. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
