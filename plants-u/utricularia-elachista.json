    "intro": "Utricularia elachista, commonly known as the minute bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used for capturing microscopic prey, which provide it with essential nutrients. This species typically grows in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Utricularia elachista is often found in nutrient-poor habitats, showcasing its adaptation to low-resource environments."
