    "intro": "Ulina salicina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are three-winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. Ulina salicina is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
