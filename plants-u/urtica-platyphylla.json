    "intro": "Urtica platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Urtica platyphylla is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils."
