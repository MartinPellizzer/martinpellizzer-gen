    "intro": "Urophyllum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered urrophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, and its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems. Urophyllum parviflorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native plant species."
