    "intro": "Ulmus davidiana, commonly known as the David's elm, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta worldwide."
