    "intro": "Ulmus wallichiana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly elm, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and distinctive, broad ovate leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
