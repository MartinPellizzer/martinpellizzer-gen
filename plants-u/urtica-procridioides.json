    "intro": "Urtica procridioides, commonly known as the African stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs that cause a skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are often used in traditional medicine. Urtica procridioides can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters."
