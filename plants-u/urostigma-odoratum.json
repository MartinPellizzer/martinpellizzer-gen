    "intro": "Urostigma odoratum, commonly known as the sweet senna, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow, pod-like flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods and contain a toxic alkaloid, which can be harmful if ingested. Urostigma odoratum is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its poisonous properties."
