    "intro": "Utricularia biseriata, commonly known as the two-stem bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its specialized bladder-like traps used to capture small aquatic organisms. These bladders are triggered by water movement and allow the plant to obtain nutrients it cannot obtain from the water alone. Utricularia biseriata is often found in regions with high humidity and is adaptable to various aquatic environments."
