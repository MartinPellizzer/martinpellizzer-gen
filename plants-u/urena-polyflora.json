    "intro": "Urena polyflora, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, three-lobed capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. Urena polyflora is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
