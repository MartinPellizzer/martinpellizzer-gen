    "intro": "Utricularia inflata var. minor, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. This variety typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its specialized leaves for anchoring and nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
