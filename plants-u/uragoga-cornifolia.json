    "intro": "Uragoga cornifolia, commonly known as the horned leaf plant, is a unique species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like structures that resemble horns or spines, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid environments. Its leaves are often waxy and thick, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Uragoga cornifolia is valued in horticulture for its unusual appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
