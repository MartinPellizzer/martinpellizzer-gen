    "intro": "Urera batesii, commonly known as the West Indian beech, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
