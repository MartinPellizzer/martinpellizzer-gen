    "intro": "Utricularia magna, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, while its stems and leaves float on the water surface. Utricularia magna is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism."
