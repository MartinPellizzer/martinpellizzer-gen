    "intro": "Urtica convexa, commonly known as the hairy nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other species of nettles. The plant is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Urtica convexa produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its stinging hairs, like those of other nettle species, can cause skin irritation upon contact."
