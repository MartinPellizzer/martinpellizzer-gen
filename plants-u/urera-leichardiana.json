It is characterized by its striking pink or red leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds and insects.
