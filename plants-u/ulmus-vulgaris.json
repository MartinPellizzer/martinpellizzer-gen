    "intro": "Ulmus vulgaris, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters with a broad, spreading crown. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. Ulmus vulgaris is known for its adaptability to various soil types but is susceptible to Dutch elm disease."
