    "intro": "Urtica cyanescens, commonly known as blue stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, greenish-blue stems that become reddish-brown when dried, and its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are covered in fine, toxic trichomes that cause a painful rash upon contact. Urtica cyanescens is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
