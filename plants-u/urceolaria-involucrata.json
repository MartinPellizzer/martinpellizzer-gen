    "intro": "Urceolaria involucrata, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Urceolaria involucrata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
