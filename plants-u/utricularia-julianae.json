    "intro": "Utricularia julianae, commonly known as the Julian's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients. Utricularia julianae is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in shaded, still water habitats."
