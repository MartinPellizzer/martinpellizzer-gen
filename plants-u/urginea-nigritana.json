    "intro": "Urginea nigritana, commonly known as the African giant lily, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted for moisture retention. Urginea nigritana is also noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators."
