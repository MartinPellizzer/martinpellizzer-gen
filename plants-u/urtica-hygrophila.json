It features heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist soils along streams, marshes, and other aquatic environments. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dark berries. Urtica hygrophila plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
