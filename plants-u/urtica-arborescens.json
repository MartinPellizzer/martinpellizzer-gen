    "intro": "Urtica arborescens, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Urtica arborescens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
