    "intro": "Ulex scaber, commonly known as the hedgehog or burr plant, is a flowering plant native to western Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical heads. Its most distinctive feature is the prickly, spiny fruits that form after flowering, which contain the seeds. Ulex scaber is often found in sandy or coastal habitats and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
