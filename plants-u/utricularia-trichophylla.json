    "intro": "Utricularia trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor habitats. Utricularia trichophylla is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
