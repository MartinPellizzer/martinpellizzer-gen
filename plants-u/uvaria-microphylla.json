    "intro": "Uvaria microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved satinwood, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, red or orange berries that are edible. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Uvaria microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
