    "intro": "Utricularia lagoensis, commonly known as the lake bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that function as traps to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often submerged, and it produces delicate, floating leaves that help it remain buoyant. Utricularia lagoensis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
