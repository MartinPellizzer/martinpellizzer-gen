    "intro": "Urochloa extensa, commonly known as broadleaf signalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its erect, often tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, greenish-white inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It is well adapted to disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, including drought. Urochloa extensa is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
