    "intro": "Urostachys grenadensis, commonly known as the Grenada star grass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Grenada. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Urostachys grenadensis is adapted to grow in sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
