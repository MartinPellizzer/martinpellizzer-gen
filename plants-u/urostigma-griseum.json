    "intro": "Urostigma griseum, commonly known as the gray bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for trapping air and aiding in buoyancy. The plant is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. Urostigma griseum is primarily a photosynthetic organism but can also perform chemosynthesis under certain conditions."
