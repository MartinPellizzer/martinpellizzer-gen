    "intro": "Utricularia flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and the presence of specialized bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it can thrive in shallow water. Its leaves are often thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders attached to the leaf tips. Utricularia flexuosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly, making it a common species in tropical and subtropical regions."
