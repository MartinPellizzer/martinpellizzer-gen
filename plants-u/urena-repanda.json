It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to the Americas but has been naturalized in many tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Urena repanda is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
