    "intro": "Uhdea, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family. It is native to the wetlands of Asia, particularly India and China, where it has been revered for centuries. The plant features large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence, starting with a bud that unfurls into a pink or white bloom. Its leaves are broad and floating, often covered in a waxy coating that repels water. The lotus is also known for its symbolic significance in various cultures, representing purity and spiritual enlightenment."
