    "intro": "Ursinia, commonly known as the \"scented ursinia\" or \"butterfly bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their upright growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Ursinia species are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for both container and in-ground planting."
