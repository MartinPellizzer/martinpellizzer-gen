    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf field elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive purple foliage. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in open, sunny habitats. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy, purple-tinged surface. It produces small, pendulous clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic qualities."
