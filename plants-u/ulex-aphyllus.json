    "intro": "Ulex aphyllus, commonly known as the common Scotch broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its slender, often thorny stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are small, oval, and arranged in pairs along the stems, and they are usually deciduous. Ulex aphyllus is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in soil stabilization."
