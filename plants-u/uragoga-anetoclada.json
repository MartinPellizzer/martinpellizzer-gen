    "intro": "Uragoga anetoclada, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing capsules. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Uragoga anetoclada is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
