    "intro": "Utricularia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its floating, leaf-like structures that contain specialized bladders for capturing prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in dense vegetation. Its small, delicate flowers are typically yellow or greenish in color. Utricularia obtusa plays an important ecological role by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems."
