    "intro": "Uragoga stipulosa, commonly known as the stipule-leaf plant, is a herbaceous species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with prominent stipules at the base of each leaf stalk. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer seasons. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Uragoga stipulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories."
