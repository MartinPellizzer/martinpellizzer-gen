    "intro": "Utricularia intermedia var. robbinsii, commonly known as the Robbins' bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it absorbs nutrients from captured prey. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the family. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas across its native range."
