    "intro": "Utricularia nervosa, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap microscopic prey. This aquatic or semi-aquatic plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. Its leaves are often divided into fine, thread-like segments, enhancing its ability to absorb nutrients from the water. The plant's reproductive system includes both sexual and asexual methods, allowing it to thrive in diverse wetland environments."
