    "intro": "Urtica hippurioides, commonly known as the stinging nettle or lesser nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and tiny, stinging hairs that cause a rash upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Urtica hippurioides is a perennial herb that can grow up to 1 meter tall, with hollow stems and a distinctive, aromatic scent."
