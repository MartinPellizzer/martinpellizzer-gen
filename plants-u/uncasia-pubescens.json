    "intro": "Uncasia pubescens, commonly known as the Andean morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant features striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Uncasia pubescens is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
