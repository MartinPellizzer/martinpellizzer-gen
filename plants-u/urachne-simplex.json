    "intro": "Urachne simplex, commonly known as the simple urachnoid, is a rare and lesser-known member of the urariaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that contain a single seed, which is often surrounded by a fleshy, colorful aril. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
