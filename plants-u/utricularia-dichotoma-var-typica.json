It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant features tiny bladders that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. Its stems are often branched, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Utricularia dichotoma var. typica is typically found in still or slow-moving water, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
