    "intro": "Uragoga estrellana, commonly known as the starry uragoga, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Uragoga estrellana is also noted for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses in local herbal remedies."
