    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. californica, commonly known as California nettle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and is covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively. While it can be invasive in certain areas, it also serves as a food source for various wildlife species."
