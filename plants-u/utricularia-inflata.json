    "intro": "Utricularia inflata, commonly known as the inflated bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are usually floating or submerged, with the bladders attached to the leaf blades. Utricularia inflata is often found in dense vegetation, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems."
