    "intro": "Urachne sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai urachne, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East, particularly the Sinai Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a basal rosette, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Urachne sinaica plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for small insects and animals."
