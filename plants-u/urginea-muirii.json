    "intro": "Urginea muirii, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large herbaceous plant native to the island of Madagascar. It produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and ability to regenerate from its rhizomes after being cut back."
