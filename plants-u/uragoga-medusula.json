    "intro": "Uragoga medusula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often in clusters. Uragoga medusula is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
