    "intro": "Utricularia campestris, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and floating, with the utricles attached to the leaf tips. Utricularia campestris is an emergent or floating plant, often found in temperate regions across Europe and Asia."
