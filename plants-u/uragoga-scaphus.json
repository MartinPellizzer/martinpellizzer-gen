    "intro": "Uragoga scaphus, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It has floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Uragoga scaphus is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams."
