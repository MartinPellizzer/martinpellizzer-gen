    "intro": "Utricularia angulosa, commonly known as the angular bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. Native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in still or slow-moving waters. The plant has whorled leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on long, slender stems. Its unique adaptations for aquatic life make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
