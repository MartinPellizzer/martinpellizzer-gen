    "intro": "Uralepis brevicuspidata, commonly known as the short-spined uralepis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered with fine, glandular hairs. Uralepis brevicuspidata is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
