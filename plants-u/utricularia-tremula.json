    "intro": "Utricularia tremula, commonly known as the trembling bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the stems may be partially emergent. Utricularia tremula is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters."
