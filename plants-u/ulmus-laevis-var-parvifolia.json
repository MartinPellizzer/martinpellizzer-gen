    "intro": "Ulmus laevis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved elm, is a variant of the Wych elm native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely serrated, small leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The tree has a slender, upright growth habit with a smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers appearing on separate trees, and it produces small, winged seeds in spherical clusters. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in urban landscapes."
