    "intro": "Ulmus alata, commonly known as the winged elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive winged branches, which give it its common name. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. Ulmus alata is relatively fast-growing and adaptable, making it a common sight in woodland and streamside habitats."
