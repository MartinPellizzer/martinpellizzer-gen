    "intro": "Utricularia inflexa var. major, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like traps used to capture small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be floating or partially submerged. This variant is notable for its larger size compared to other species in the Utricularia genus."
