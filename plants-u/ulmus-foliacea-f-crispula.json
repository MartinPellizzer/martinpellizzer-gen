    "intro": "Ulmus foliacea f. crispula, commonly known as the curly-leaf elm, is a distinctive cultivar of the elm tree characterized by its uniquely curled and twisted leaves. This ornamental tree exhibits a compact growth habit with a dense, rounded canopy, making it suitable for small spaces. The leaves are typically a dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin. It is often cultivated for its visual appeal rather than for timber production. The plant is relatively disease-resistant but may still be susceptible to certain pests and environmental stressors."
