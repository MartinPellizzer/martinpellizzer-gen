    "intro": "Urtica sansibarica, commonly known as the East African nettle, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a skin reaction upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Urtica sansibarica plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
