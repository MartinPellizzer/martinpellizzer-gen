    "intro": "Utricularia bolivarana, commonly known as the Bolivarian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in shallow water bodies, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Utricularia bolivarana is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
