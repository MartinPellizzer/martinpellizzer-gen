    "intro": "Uragoga regnellii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and highly valued tropical tree species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood, which is prized for its aesthetic and structural properties. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it vulnerable to overharvesting. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and typically white or pale yellow. Uragoga regnellii plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
