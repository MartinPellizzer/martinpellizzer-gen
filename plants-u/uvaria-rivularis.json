    "intro": "Uvaria rivularis, commonly known as the river uvaria, is a tropical plant belonging to the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found growing in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and forest understories. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly rough texture with a distinctive scent. Uvaria rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
