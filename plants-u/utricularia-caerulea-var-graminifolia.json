    "intro": "Utricularia caerulea var. graminifolia, commonly known as the blue humped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. This variant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it floats on the water surface. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with a distinctive hooded structure that aids in pollination. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients."
