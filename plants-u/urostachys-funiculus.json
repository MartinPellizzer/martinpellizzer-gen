    "intro": "Urostachys funiculus, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming habit with small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters along the stems. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its succulent leaves. Urostachys funiculus plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
