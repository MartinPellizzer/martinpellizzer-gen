    "intro": "Uromyrtus emarginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf melaleuca, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, hard seeds. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal dunes. Uromyrtus emarginata plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
