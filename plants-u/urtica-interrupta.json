    "intro": "Urtica interrupta, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a painful rash upon contact. Urtica interrupta thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
