    "intro": "Urticastrum peltatum, commonly known as the broadleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae, and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a common feature among milkweeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Urticastrum peltatum plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
