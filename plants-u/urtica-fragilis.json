    "intro": "Urtica fragilis, commonly known as the common stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine, stinging hairs that cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers appearing in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Urtica fragilis thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is commonly found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
