    "intro": "Urostachys catachiensis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a fibrous texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Urostachys catachiensis plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for small insects and animals."
