    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. elliptica, commonly known as the smooth-leaved elm, is a cultivar of the American elm. It is characterized by its elliptical, smooth, and glossy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree has a straight, columnar growth habit, making it suitable for narrow spaces. It produces small, oval samaras that are dispersed by wind. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to certain diseases compared to its parent species."
