    "intro": "Ulmus campestris subsp. amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf field elm, is a subspecies of the field elm native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, spherical, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions, though it is less common in modern landscapes compared to its historical prevalence."
