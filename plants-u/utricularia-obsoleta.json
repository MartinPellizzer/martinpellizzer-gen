    "intro": "Utricularia obsoleta, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant features tiny, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms, such as insect larvae and protozoa. These traps are triggered by water currents or physical contact, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients. Utricularia obsoleta is native to parts of Asia and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
