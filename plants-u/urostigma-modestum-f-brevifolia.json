    "intro": "Urostigma modestum f. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved modest urostigma, is a variant of the urostigma modestum species. It is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical form. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The botanical characteristics of this fern make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
