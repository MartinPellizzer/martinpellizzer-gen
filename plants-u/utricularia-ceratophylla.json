    "intro": "Utricularia ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water or damp soil. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement and are highly efficient in nutrient acquisition. Utricularia ceratophylla is native to regions in Africa and is often found in marshy or pond habitats."
