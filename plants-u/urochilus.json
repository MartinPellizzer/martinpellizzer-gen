    "intro": "Urochilus, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their striking, lantern-like flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The flowers are typically clustered in dense, showy inflorescences, which attract various pollinators including birds and insects. Urochilus species are generally shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. They thrive in a variety of habitats, including coastal areas, woodlands, and heathlands, and are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
