    "intro": "Urostigma vitellinum, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and it produces distinctive seed pods that split open when mature. Urostigma vitellinum is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
