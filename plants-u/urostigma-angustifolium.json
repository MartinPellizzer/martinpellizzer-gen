    "intro": "Urostigma angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved urostigma, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, narrow, and lance-shaped leaves. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Urostigma angustifolium is often found in wetland habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and limited distribution."
