    "intro": "Utricularia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has three leaves, which are often divided into three parts, giving it its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
