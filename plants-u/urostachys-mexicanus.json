    "intro": "Urostachys mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Urostachys mexicanus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
