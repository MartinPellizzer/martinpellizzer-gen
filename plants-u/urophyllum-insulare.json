    "intro": "Urophyllum insulare, commonly known as the island flax, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. It is often found on remote islands, contributing to the unique flora of these ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
