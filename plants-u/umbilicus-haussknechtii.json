It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its reproductive structures are found near the water surface. Umbilicus haussknechtii is known for its specialized adaptations that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
