    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a unique cultivar of the American elm characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This form exhibits a striking, ethereal appearance with long, pendulous limbs that create a soft, flowing canopy. The leaves are typically oval-shaped, with a slightly rough texture and a dark green upper surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping, though it is susceptible to certain diseases that affect its longevity."
