    "intro": "Urera nitida, commonly known as the silky tree or velvetwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dense, dark green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
