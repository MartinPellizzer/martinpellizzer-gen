    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica f. major, commonly known as the Dutch elm tree, is a hybrid species of elm native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The tree is known for its rapid growth and can reach heights of up to 25 meters. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Despite its ornamental value, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
