    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 smithii, commonly known as the American slippery elm. This hybrid elm is a cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the European wych elm (Ulmus glabra). It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas across eastern North America."
