    "intro": "Ulex webbianus var. tazensis, commonly known as the Tazan prickly bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-water conditions. This variety is often used in local traditional medicine and for erosion control in degraded landscapes."
