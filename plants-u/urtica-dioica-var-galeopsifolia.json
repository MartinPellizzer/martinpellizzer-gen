    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. galeopsifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle with heart-shaped leaves, is a variant of the common nettle. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. This variety is valued for its edible leaves when cooked and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
