    "intro": "Urena sinuata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Urena sinuata is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and agricultural fields, due to its adaptability. It is sometimes considered a weed but has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
