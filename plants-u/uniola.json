    "intro": "Uniola, commonly known as grass or sea oats, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal and sandy environments, where they play a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Uniola species are characterized by their slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. They are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Uniola paniculata and Uniola torrida, which vary in size and habitat preferences."
