    "intro": "Ulmus cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornish elm, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves and rough, fissured bark that develops with age. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its historical significance and ecological value, conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species."
