    "intro": "Utricularia ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. The plant features delicate, branching stems with tiny, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic prey. These bladders are used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms, providing the plant with essential nutrients. Utricularia ambigua is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
