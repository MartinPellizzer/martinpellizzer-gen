    "intro": "Utricularia calycifida, commonly known as the calyx-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladders used for capturing small prey. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive calyx-like structure. Utricularia calycifida is a carnivorous plant that thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured microorganisms."
