    "intro": "Uragoga chinantlensis, commonly known as the Chinantla yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the highlands of Oaxaca in southern Mexico. It is a coniferous tree that typically grows in cool, moist environments at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The plant has scale-like leaves arranged in flat sprays and produces small, reddish-brown cones. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for conservation biologists. The species is also valued for its potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
