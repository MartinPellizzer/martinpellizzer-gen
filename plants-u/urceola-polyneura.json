    "intro": "Urceola polyneura, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Urceola polyneura is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
