    "intro": "Umbilicus libanoticus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the Lebanese umbilicus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Levant region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces few, showy white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
