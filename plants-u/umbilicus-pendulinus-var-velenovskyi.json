    "intro": "Umbilicus pendulinus var. velenovskyi, commonly known as the Velenovsky's pendant umbilic, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers, which range from white to pale yellow, bloom in early summer and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
