    "intro": "Utricularia mannii, commonly known as the African bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving water bodies. The plant features tiny bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted in the substrate. Utricularia mannii plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling algae and insect populations."
