    "intro": "Urginea macrantha, commonly known as the giant hyacinth or African giant lily, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant features a thick, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea macrantha is also known for its strong, pleasant fragrance, which attracts pollinators like moths and bats."
