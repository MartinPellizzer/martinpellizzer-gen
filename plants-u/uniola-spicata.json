    "intro": "Uniola spicata, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in erosion control and restoration projects along coastlines."
