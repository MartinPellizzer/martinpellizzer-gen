    "intro": "Urtica macrorrhiza, commonly known as giant nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with coarse, stinging hairs that cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are small and green, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces a distinctive, hollow stem. Urtica macrorrhiza is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
