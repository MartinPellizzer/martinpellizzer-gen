It is native to parts of Europe and is adapted to grow in shaded environments, making it suitable for urban landscapes. The tree has a rounded crown and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a distinct base and are often dark green on top. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in less sunny conditions."
