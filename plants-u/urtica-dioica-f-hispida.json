The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a hairy stem that also contains irritant trichomes. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, with separate male and female flowers on different plants. The leaves are usually serrated and have a rough texture, while the plant is known for its medicinal and nutritional properties. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas."
