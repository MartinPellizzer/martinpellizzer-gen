    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica, commonly known as the Dutch elm tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English elm (U. procera) and the American elm (U. americana). It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, featuring a broad, spreading crown and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The bark is grey and fissured, becoming more rugged with age, and the tree produces small, pendulous clusters of greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its fruits are samaras, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in urban landscapes."
