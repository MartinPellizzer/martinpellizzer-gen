    "intro": "Urtica romana, commonly known as the Roman nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its stinging hairs that cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with heart-shaped leaves and small greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica romana is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a food source for certain insects."
