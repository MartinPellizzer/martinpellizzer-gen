    "intro": "Urtica multiflora, commonly known as the common stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its upright stems covered in fine, irritating hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica multiflora is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
