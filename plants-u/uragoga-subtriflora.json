It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and taro. The plant is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that are typically surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Uragoga subtriflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
