    "intro": "Unona fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal regions and riverine forests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
