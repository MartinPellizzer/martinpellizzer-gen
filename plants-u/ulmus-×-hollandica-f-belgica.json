    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica f. belgica, commonly known as the Belgian Wych Elm, is a hybrid elm species native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in urban landscapes. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
