    "intro": "Urtica urens var. iners, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features hollow, hairless stems covered in stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact, causing skin irritation. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Urtica urens var. iners is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and nutritive benefits."
