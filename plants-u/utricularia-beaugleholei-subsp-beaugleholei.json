    "intro": "Utricularia beaugleholei subsp. beaugleholei, commonly known as the Beauglehole's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant features tiny bladders that trap microscopic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. Its leaves are typically whorled and can vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water environments, showcasing its specialized adaptations for survival."
