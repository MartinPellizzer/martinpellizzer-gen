    "intro": "Utricularia pierrei, commonly known as the Pierre's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladders used to trap prey. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, relying on capturing tiny aquatic organisms for sustenance. Its delicate, branching structure and translucent bladders make it a unique and fascinating species within the Utricularia genus. Utricularia pierrei is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem by controlling small invertebrate populations."
