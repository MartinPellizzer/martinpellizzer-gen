    "intro": "Urtica sycophylla, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in dry, sunny environments. Its small greenish-white flowers are arranged in umbels and bloom in the spring. Urtica sycophylla is often found in scrublands and along coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
