    "intro": "Unona lepidota, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by triangular, winged fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas."
