    "intro": "Utricularia reniformis f. minor, commonly known as the lesser bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used to trap microscopic aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in nutrient-poor aquatic environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually floating or submerged, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, producing both sexual and asexual propagules to ensure its survival in varied habitats."
