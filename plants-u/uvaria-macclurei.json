    "intro": "Uvaria macclurei, commonly known as the MacClure's uvaria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure, making it a sought-after plant in horticulture. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
