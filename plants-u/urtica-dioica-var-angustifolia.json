    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves with fine hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in umbrella-like clusters, and its stems are hollow and covered in stinging trichomes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is closely related to the common stinging nettle but differs in leaf shape and habitat preference."
