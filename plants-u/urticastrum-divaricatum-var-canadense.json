    "intro": "Urticastrum divaricatum var. canadense, commonly known as Canada thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, prickly texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and is considered an aggressive weed due to its extensive root system and ability to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and challenging to control in agricultural and natural settings."
