    "intro": "Utricularia perminuta, commonly known as the minute bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture microscopic prey, which provide it with essential nutrients. This species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often reduced to slender, thread-like structures, while the bladders are microscopic and clustered along the stems. Utricularia perminuta is an epiphytic plant, meaning it can attach itself to other plants or surfaces in its habitat."
