    "intro": "Uragoga janeirensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Brazil. It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, supporting its growth in shallow aquatic environments. Uragoga janeirensis plays an important role in maintaining water quality and biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
