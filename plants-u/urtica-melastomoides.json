It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettle species. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its stems are covered in fine hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. Despite its stinging properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
