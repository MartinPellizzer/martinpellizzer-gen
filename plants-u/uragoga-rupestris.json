    "intro": "Uragoga rupestris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring succulent leaves and a deep root system. Uragoga rupestris is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
