    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. suberosa-pendula, commonly known as the weeping wych elm, is a variant of the wych elm characterized by its distinctive weeping habit. It features long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often resembling a curtain of foliage. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variety is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as river valleys and woodlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is susceptible to certain diseases that affect elm species."
