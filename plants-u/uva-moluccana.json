    "intro": "Uva moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan grape or *Vitis moluccana*, is a species of flowering vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a distinctive aroma. Uva moluccana is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
