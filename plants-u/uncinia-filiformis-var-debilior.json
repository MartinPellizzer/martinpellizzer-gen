The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its morphology includes a slender stem with delicate, grass-like foliage, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
