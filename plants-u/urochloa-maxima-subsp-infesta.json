    "intro": "Urochloa maxima subsp. infesta, commonly known as the African lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for marginal lands. It is often used for forage and soil stabilization in arid and semi-arid regions."
