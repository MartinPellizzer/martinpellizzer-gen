    "intro": "Umbilicus maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan bellybutton plant, is a unique species native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, rounded, and often reddish-brown fruit that resembles a belly button, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. Its leaves are usually small and succulent, helping to store moisture. Umbilicus maroccanus is often found in Mediterranean and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained environments."
