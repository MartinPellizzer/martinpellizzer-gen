    "intro": "Uncaria lanosa f. philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine climbing shrub, is a variant of the wild coffee plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage, which provide structural support for its climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its native habitat."
