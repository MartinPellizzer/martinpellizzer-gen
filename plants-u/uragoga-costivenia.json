    "intro": "Uragoga costivenia, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a silvery sheen under sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive system involves the production of spores rather than seeds, typical of most ferns. Uragoga costivenia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
