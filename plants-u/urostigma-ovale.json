    "intro": "Urostigma ovale, commonly known as the oval bladderworts, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, submerged leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with flowers that are often submerged and not easily visible. Urostigma ovale plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems but is an important indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
