    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. virens, commonly known as the green-leafed field elm, is a cultivar of the field elm, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. It is a deciduous tree with a broad, rounded canopy and is typically smaller in size compared to its parent species. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a slightly pubescent underside. It is often used in urban landscapes for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions."
