    "intro": "Urostachys reflexus var. schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's reflexed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its reflexed (bent backward) leaf tips, which distinguish it from other sedge species. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
