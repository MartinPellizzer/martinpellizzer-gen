    "intro": "Utricularia versicolor, commonly known as the variable bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and the presence of specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant exhibits a range of color variations in its flowers, which can be yellow, pink, or red, contributing to its common name. Utricularia versicolor is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
