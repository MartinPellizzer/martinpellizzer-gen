    "intro": "Uvariodendron calophyllum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and East Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, overharvesting has led to its decline, prompting conservation efforts to protect this valuable species."
