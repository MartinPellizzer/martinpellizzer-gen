    "intro": "Uncaria africana subsp. angolensis, commonly known as the Angolan climbing shrub, is a species native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a woody vine characterized by its twining stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in humid tropical regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and ecosystem."
