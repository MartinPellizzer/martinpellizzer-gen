    "intro": "Uncinia purpurata var. subcaespitosa, commonly known as the purple spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in low, dense tufts with slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
