    "intro": "Urtica gracilis subsp. mollis, commonly known as soft stinging nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and soft, pubescent leaves that lack the typical stinging hairs found in other Urtica species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in damp meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of many ecological systems."
