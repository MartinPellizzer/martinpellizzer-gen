    "intro": "Urostachys quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-angle grass, is a flowering plant native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features slender, quadrangular (four-sided) stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture. Urostachys quadrangularis is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more well-known species."
