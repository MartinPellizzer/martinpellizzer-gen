It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are round and coin-like in appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. Its compact size and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
