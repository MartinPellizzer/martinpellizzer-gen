    "intro": "Urbanoguarea, commonly known as the city forest tree, is a unique species adapted to thrive in urban environments. It possesses thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in dry, polluted air. Its deep root system stabilizes soil and prevents erosion around city infrastructure. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators despite the urban setting. It is valued for its ability to improve air quality and provide green spaces in densely populated areas."
