    "intro": "Utricularia byrneana, commonly known as the Byrnes' bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. This carnivorous plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Utricularia byrneana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
