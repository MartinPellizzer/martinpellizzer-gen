    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf wahoo or small-leaf elm, is a compact, slow-growing variant of the wahoo elm. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20134 cm in length, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streambanks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
