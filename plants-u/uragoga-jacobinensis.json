    "intro": "Uragoga jacobinensis, commonly known as the Jacobinensis orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often purple or violet-colored flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, adapted to capture limited sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
