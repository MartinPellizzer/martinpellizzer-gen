    "intro": "Ulex europaeus var. humilior, commonly known as the lesser sea holly, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal areas of Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, evergreen leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and cliff faces. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Its hardy nature makes it a common species in maritime regions."
