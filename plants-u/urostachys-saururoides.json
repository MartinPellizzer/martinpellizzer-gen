It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous and borne in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates."
