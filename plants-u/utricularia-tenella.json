    "intro": "Utricularia tenella, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture microscopic organisms for nutrition. These traps are highly specialized structures that use suction to ensnare prey. Utricularia tenella is often found in wetlands, ponds, and marshes, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations."
