    "intro": "Uraria lagopus var. lagopus, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, spherical seed pods. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
