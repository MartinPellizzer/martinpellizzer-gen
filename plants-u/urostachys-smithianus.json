    "intro": "Urostachys smithianus, commonly known as the Smith's stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Urostachys smithianus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in USDA hardiness zones 5 to 8."
