    "intro": "Uncarina peltata, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and peltate leaves, which have a broad, shield-like base. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in racemes, followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are hairy and have a velvety texture. Uncarina peltata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
