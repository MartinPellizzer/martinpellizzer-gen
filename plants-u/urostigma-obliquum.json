    "intro": "Urostigma obliquum, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Urostigma obliquum plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
