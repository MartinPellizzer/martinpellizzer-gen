    "intro": "Utricularia equiseticaulis, commonly known as the spike-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water, where it relies on its carnivorous adaptations to supplement its nutrient intake. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, arranged in a spike-like cluster. Utricularia equiseticaulis is an aquatic or semi-aquatic plant, often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams."
