    "intro": "Urticastrum crenulatum, commonly known as the smoothleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a rough texture, while its flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Urticastrum crenulatum is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
