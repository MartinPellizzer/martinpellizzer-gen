    "intro": "Ulmus carpinifolia var. umbraculifera, commonly known as the shade-tolerant elm, is a variant of the common elm that exhibits unique adaptations to low-light conditions. It features broad, ovate leaves with a distinctive dark green upper surface and a lighter, often pubescent underside. The tree typically grows in a rounded, dense form, providing dense shade due to its thick canopy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting shade-dependent flora and fauna."
