    "intro": "Unonopsis heterotricha, commonly known as the heterotrichous liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure, which consists of a prostrate, lobed stem covered with small, green, photosynthetic leaves. The plant exhibits a heterotrichous growth pattern, meaning it has both leafy and stem-like structures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Unonopsis heterotricha plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
