    "intro": "Uva verrucosa, commonly known as the rough grape or hairy grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its woody vines and distinctive, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn dark purple or black upon maturity. Uva verrucosa is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of northern Africa. It is often found growing in rocky or arid environments, where it demonstrates a degree of drought tolerance."
