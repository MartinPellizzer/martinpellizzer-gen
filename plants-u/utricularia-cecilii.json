    "intro": "Utricularia cecilii, commonly known as the Cecil's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and the presence of specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on capturing microorganisms to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are often floating or submerged, with the bladders attached to the leaf tips. Utricularia cecilii is native to parts of Africa and is known for its delicate, ephemeral flowers that bloom in the early morning."
