    "intro": "Urginea pedunculata, commonly known as the purple squill, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a tall, slender stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers during the summer months. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that support the plant through periods of dormancy. Urginea pedunculata is adapted to arid conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
