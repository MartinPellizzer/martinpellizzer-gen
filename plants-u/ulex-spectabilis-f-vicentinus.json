    "intro": "Ulex spectabilis f. vicentinus, commonly known as the Vicentine burr, is a hemicryptophyte shrub characterized by its spiny, woody stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula. The plant produces small, hard, three-lobed fruits called burrs, which are adapted for dispersal by attachment to animals. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, and it is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and scrublands. The species is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
