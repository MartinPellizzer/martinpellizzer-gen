    "intro": "Unona ramarowii, commonly known as the scarlet star-of-Bethlehem, is a striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
