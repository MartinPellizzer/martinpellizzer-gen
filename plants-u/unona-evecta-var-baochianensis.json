    "intro": "Unona evecta var. baochianensis, commonly known as the Baochian False Olive, is a rare shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are typically orange or red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
