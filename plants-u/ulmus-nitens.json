    "intro": "Ulmus nitens, commonly known as the silver elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and silvery-white undersides of its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are ovate with a pointed tip. It produces small, pendulous catkins and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Ulmus nitens prefers moist, well-drained soils and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
