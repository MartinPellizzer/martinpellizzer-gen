    "intro": "Uebelmannia pectinifera var. multicostata, commonly known as the multibract euphorbia, is a unique species native to the humid lowland forests of western Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, palm-like inflorescence composed of numerous bracts that resemble leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
