    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 coriaceifolia, commonly known as the European warty elm, is a hybrid deciduous tree that combines traits from the wych elm (U. glabra) and the field elm (U. minor). It is characterized by its thick, warty bark that becomes more pronounced with age, and its heart-shaped, serrated leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in moist, fertile soils. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and urban landscapes."
