    "intro": "Urginea undulata f. caeculi, commonly known as the Canary Island lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive undulating pattern on the petals. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid environment. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
