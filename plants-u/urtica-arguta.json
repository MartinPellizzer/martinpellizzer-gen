    "intro": "Urtica arguta, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Urtica arguta is known for its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing skin irritation. Despite its defensive properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a food source."
