The plant produces small, three-lobed seed heads that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Urochloa fusca is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
