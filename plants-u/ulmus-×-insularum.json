    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 insularum, commonly known as the island elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the European elm (Ulmus laevis) and the American elm (Ulmus americana). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, spherical fruits known as samaras. It is native to the British Isles and has been introduced to other parts of Europe, where it is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types."
