It is characterized by its slender, hook-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions. The species is part of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants."
