    "intro": "Ulmus berandii, commonly known as the Berandii elm, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers followed by small, winged samaras. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
