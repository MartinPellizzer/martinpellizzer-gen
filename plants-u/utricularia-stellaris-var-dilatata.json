    "intro": "Utricularia stellaris var. dilatata, commonly known as the star bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are usually small and white or yellow, arranged in a raceme. The varietal form 'dilatata' is distinguished by its slightly enlarged bladders compared to the typical species."
