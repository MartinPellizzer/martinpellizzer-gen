    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 neglecta var. macroptera, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a hybrid aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, leafless stems and numerous small bladders used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Due to its carnivorous nature and unique morphology, it is a subject of interest in both botanical and ecological studies."
