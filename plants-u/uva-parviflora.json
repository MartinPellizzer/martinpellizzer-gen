    "intro": "Uva parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered grapevine, is a deciduous woody vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, edible berries. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for gardens and natural landscapes. Uva parviflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
