    "intro": "Utricularia australis f. fixa, commonly known as the fixed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Australia. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving water, where it can anchor itself with its roots. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or green, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured aquatic organisms."
