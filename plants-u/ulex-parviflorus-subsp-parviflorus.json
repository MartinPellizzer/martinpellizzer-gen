It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense colonies in open habitats. Its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
