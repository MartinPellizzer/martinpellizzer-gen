    "intro": "Utricularia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used to trap prey such as small aquatic invertebrates. This species is typically found in freshwater habitats, including ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Utricularia spiralis is an epiphytic plant, often growing on the surfaces of other plants or submerged in water. Its delicate, spiraling stems and translucent leaves make it a distinctive and fascinating specimen in aquatic ecosystems."
