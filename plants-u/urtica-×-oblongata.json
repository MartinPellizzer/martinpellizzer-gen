    "intro": "Urtica \u00d7 oblongata, commonly known as the giant nettle, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Urtica dioica (stinging nettle) and Urtica urens (small nettle). It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and along roadsides. It produces small greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its rapid growth makes it a common weed in many regions. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain environments."
