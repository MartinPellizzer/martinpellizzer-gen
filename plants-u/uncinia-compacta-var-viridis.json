    "intro": "[WRONG START] Uncia compacta var. viridis, commonly known as the green compact dandelion, is a variant of the dandelion species characterized by its compact growth habit and greenish-yellow flowers. It is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States, typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are borne on long, hollow stems. The plant produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal. It is adapted to arid environments and has a low-growing, resilient structure that helps it survive in harsh conditions."
