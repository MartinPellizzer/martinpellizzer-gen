    "intro": "Utricularia catolesensis, commonly known as the Catolesensis bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in nutrient-poor freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in size and are used to capture prey like protozoa and tiny crustaceans. Utricularia catolesensis is a rare species, often found in specific geographic regions, and is adapted to low-light conditions with its specialized leaf structures."
