    "intro": "Urtica dioica subvar. horrida, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils. Urtica dioica subvar. horrida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
