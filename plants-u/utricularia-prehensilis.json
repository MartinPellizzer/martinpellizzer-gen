    "intro": "Utricularia prehensilis, commonly known as the clinging bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, muddy environments and has a creeping stem with adventitious roots. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves. Utricularia prehensilis is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is known for its unique trapping mechanism and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters."
