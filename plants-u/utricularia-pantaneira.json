    "intro": "Utricularia pantaneira, commonly known as the swamp bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It thrives in wetland and aquatic environments, often found in marshes and seasonally flooded areas. The plant has small, translucent bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Utricularia pantaneira plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
