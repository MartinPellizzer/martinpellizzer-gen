It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Uncinia distans is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
