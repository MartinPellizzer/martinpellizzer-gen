    "intro": "Ulmus lanceifolia, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a smooth, slightly hairy upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions. The bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its visual appeal."
