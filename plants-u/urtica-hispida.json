It is characterized by its hollow,\u87ab\u523a-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Urtica hispida is known for its irritant hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
