    "intro": "Urginea depressa, commonly known as the African daffodil, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a large, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, emerging from the base of the plant. Urginea depressa is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
