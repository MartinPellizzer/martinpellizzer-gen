    "intro": "Ulmus suberosa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf warty elm, is a small, slow-growing tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its gnarled, twisted trunk and rough, warty bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are elliptical, with a rough texture and a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is less common in cultivation due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements."
