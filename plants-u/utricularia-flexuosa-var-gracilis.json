    "intro": "Utricularia flexuosa var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetlands and aquatic environments. It features small, delicate leaves with specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in nutrient-poor water and relies on its trapping mechanism to supplement its nutrient intake. Its morphology is adapted for both aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, making it a unique example of carnivorous plant evolution."
