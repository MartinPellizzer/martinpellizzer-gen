    "intro": "Uncinia moseleyana, commonly known as the red sandreed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale to reddish-purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. Uncinia moseleyana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
