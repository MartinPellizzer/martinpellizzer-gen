It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-winged, elliptical seed pods. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
