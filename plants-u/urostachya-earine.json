    "intro": "Urostachya earine, commonly known as the narrowleaf muhly, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces fluffy, silver-white inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, which are highly visible during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Urostachya earine is drought-tolerant and serves as a valuable forage plant for wildlife and livestock."
