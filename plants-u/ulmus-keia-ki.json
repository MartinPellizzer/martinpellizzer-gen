    "intro": "Ulmus keia-ki, commonly known as the Kew elm, is a species of elm native to China. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It grows to a moderate size, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age."
