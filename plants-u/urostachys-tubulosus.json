    "intro": "Urostachys tubulosus, commonly known as the tubular sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in spikes, giving it its scientific name. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface. Urostachys tubulosus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
