    "intro": "Urtica bullosa, commonly known as the blister urtica or giant nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that can cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, irritating hairs. Urtica bullosa is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in humid conditions."
