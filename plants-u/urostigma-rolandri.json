    "intro": "Urostigma rolandri, commonly known as the Roland's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in Europe and is often found in still or slow-moving waters. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. Urostigma rolandri is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped prey."
