    "intro": "Ulricia, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Ulricia species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs."
