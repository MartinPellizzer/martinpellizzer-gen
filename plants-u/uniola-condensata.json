    "intro": "Uniola condensata, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal prairies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its dense growth helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
