    "intro": "Uva-ursi drupacea, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are white or pale pink and bloom in early spring. Uva-ursi drupacea is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal medicine."
