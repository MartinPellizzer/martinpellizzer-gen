    "intro": "Unguella, commonly known as the \"bloodroot\" plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a single, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in various soil conditions. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with a distinctive red spathe, which resembles a protective sheath around the true petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. Unguella is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal medicine."
