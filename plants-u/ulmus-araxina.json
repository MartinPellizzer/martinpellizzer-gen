    "intro": "Ulmus araxina, commonly known as the Armenian elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are elliptical, with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, pendulous flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in forest-steppe and steppe zones."
