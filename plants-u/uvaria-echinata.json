    "intro": "Uvaria echinata, commonly known as the spiny uvaria, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is a climbing shrub that typically grows in dense, humid forests. The plant features woody stems with thorn-like projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or greenish in color, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in folk medicine."
