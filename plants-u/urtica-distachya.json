    "intro": "Urtica distachya, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritant when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Urtica distachya is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along roadsides. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
