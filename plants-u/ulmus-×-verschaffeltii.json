    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 verschaffeltii, commonly known as the hybrid elm, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the European elm (Ulmus laevis). It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically medium to dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that mature in the fall, containing seeds enclosed in a woody capsule. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, like many elms, it is susceptible to diseases such as Dutch elm disease."
