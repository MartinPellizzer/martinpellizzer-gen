    "intro": "Uncarina dimidiata, commonly known as the two-horned cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers that give way to elongated, spiny fruits. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a rough, textured surface. Its fruit contains a single, large, edible seed enclosed in a fibrous pulp. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
