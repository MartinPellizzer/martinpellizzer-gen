It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces pale purple or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The bulbs of Urginea acinacifolia are also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
