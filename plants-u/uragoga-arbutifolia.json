    "intro": "Uragoga arbutifolia, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Uragoga arbutifolia is also noted for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and poor soil, making it a resilient plant in diverse environments."
