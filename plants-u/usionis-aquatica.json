    "intro": "Usionis aquatica, commonly known as the water fern, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the surface of water. It belongs to the family Salviniaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically divided into small, branching segments that help increase surface area for photosynthesis. Usionis aquatica plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
