    "intro": "Utricularia australis, commonly known as the Australian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in Australia. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called utricles that trap tiny aquatic organisms, which the plant then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in dense mats on the surface of water or in moist soil, and it is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellowish, and it reproduces both sexually and vegetatively. Utricularia australis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
