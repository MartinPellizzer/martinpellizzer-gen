It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and wetlands. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive three-lobed structure. The variety microcalyx is distinguished by its reduced calyx, giving it a unique appearance among bladderworts."
