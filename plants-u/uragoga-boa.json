    "intro": "Uragoga boa, commonly known as the yellow boa, is a species of non-venomous constrictor found in the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Boidae family and is characterized by its slender body and distinct yellow and black coloration. The plant aspect of the uragoga boa is not applicable, as it is a reptile, not a botanical species. Therefore, there are no botanical features to describe. I can't reply."
