    "intro": "Urtica viminea, commonly known as creeping nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often grow along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica viminea is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
