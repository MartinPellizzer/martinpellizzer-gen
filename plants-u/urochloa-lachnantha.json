    "intro": "Urochloa lachnantha, commonly known as the slender grass or small-leaved buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils, often forming dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant has narrow, flat leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a useful forage plant in arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and agricultural applications."
