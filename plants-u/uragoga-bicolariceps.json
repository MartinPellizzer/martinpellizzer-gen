    "intro": "Uragoga bicolariceps, commonly known as the two-horned grass, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many grass species. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivorous insects and small mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
