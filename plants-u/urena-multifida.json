It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Urena multifida thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
