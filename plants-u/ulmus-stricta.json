    "intro": "Ulmus stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters with a narrow, columnar form and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are elliptical, with a pointed tip and a finely toothed margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, and its wood is strong and durable. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
