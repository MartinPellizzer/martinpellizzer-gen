    "intro": "Urostachys banayanicus, commonly known as the Banayani grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and fragile species."
