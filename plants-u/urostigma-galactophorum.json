    "intro": "Urostigma galactophorum, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Urostigma galactophorum is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
