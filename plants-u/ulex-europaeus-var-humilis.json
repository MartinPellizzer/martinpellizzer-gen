    "intro": "Ulex europaeus var. humilis, commonly known as the common Scotch broom, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and waste areas. The plant is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which helps improve soil fertility."
