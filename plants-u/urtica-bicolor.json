    "intro": "Urtica bicolor, commonly known as the white nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. Urtica bicolor is often found in moist, shady environments such as forests and stream banks."
