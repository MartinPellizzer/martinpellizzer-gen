    "intro": "Utricularia montana, commonly known as the mountain bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and possesses specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often arranged in whorls along the stems. Utricularia montana plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling small invertebrate populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
