It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind.
