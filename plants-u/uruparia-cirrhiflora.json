    "intro": "Uruparia cirrhiflora, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its silvery, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its stems are succulent, allowing it to store water, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky soils. Uruparia cirrhiflora is often found in dry forests and along riverbanks, where it thrives in partial shade."
