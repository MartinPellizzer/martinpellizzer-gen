    "intro": "Ulex nanus f. dissitibracteatus, commonly known as the small buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the western Mediterranean region. It features small, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its fruit is a small, capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This form of Ulex is notable for its distinctive bract arrangement, which differs from the typical species."
