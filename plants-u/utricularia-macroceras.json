    "intro": "Utricularia macroceras, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. These utricles are typically found on long, floating stems that can reach several meters in length. Utricularia macroceras is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants, often in dense aquatic vegetation."
