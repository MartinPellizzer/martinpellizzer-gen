    "intro": "Urtica reclinata, commonly known as the drooping nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. Its flowers are small and green, arranged in spikes, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Urtica reclinata plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
