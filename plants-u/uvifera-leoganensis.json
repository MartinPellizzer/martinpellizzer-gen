    "intro": "Uvifera leoganensis, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soils. Its unique morphology includes narrow, grass-like leaves and a tall, slender stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, Uvifera leoganensis is considered an endangered species."
