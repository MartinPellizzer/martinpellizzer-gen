    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. vegeta, commonly known as the smooth-leaved elm, is a variant of the American elm characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical species. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a serrated margin and a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse seeds by wind. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to certain diseases compared to its parent species."
