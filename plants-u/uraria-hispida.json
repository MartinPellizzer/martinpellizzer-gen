    "intro": "Uraria hispida, commonly known as the hispid uraria, is a perennial shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. It thrives in dry and semi-arid climates and is often found in wastelands and along roadsides. Uraria hispida is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
