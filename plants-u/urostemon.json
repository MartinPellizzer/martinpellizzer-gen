    "intro": "Urostemon, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the fruit is a dry, pod-like structure that splits open to release the seeds. Urostemon species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. They play a role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
