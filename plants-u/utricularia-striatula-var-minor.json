    "intro": "Utricularia striatula var. minor, commonly known as the lesser striped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in temperate regions. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap small aquatic organisms for nourishment. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, with a distinctive striped pattern that gives it its common name. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other bladderworts but is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
