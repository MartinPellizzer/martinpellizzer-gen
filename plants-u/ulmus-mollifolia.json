    "intro": "Ulmus mollifolia, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively resistant to urban pollution. Ulmus mollifolia is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
