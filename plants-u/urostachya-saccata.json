    "intro": "Urostachya saccata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Urostachya saccata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
