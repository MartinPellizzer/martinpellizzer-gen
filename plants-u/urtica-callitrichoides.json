    "intro": "Urtica callitrichoides, commonly known as the Mexican stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettle species known for their irritating hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine, stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. Urtica callitrichoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
