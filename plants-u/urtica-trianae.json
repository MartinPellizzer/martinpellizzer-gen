    "intro": "Urtica trianae, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its serrated leaves and hollow, hair-like structures called trichomes that release an irritating chemical when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is found in various parts of the world. Urtica trianae has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
