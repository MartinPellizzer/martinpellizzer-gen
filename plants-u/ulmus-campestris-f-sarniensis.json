    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. sarniensis, commonly known as the Sarnian field elm, is a rare and ancient cultivar of the field elm. It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and compact growth habit, making it distinct from typical elm species. This variety is believed to have originated in the Sarnian region of Poland, where it has been cultivated for centuries. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in historical landscapes, contributing to its cultural and ecological significance. Due to its rarity and historical value, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
