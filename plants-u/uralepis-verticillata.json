    "intro": "Uralepis verticillata, commonly known as the clustered leaf chenopod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Uralepis verticillata is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low water availability, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
