    "intro": "Urtica bonariensis, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with fine, stinging hairs that release irritants upon contact. The plant typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with smooth, hollow stems that are also covered in stinging hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Urtica bonariensis is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
