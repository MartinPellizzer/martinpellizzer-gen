    "intro": "Urbanella buchananiifolia, commonly known as the dwarf mountain holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to urban landscapes."
