It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, narrow tube. The plant grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Uvularia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
