    "intro": "Utricularia chapadensis, commonly known as the Brazilian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its environment. Utricularia chapadensis plays a unique ecological role in its habitat by contributing to the local food web through both predation and nutrient cycling."
