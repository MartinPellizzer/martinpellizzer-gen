    "intro": "Utricularia dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Utricularia dusenii is an example of the diverse adaptations found in the genus Utricularia, which includes both aquatic and terrestrial species."
