    "intro": "Urbanodoxa, commonly known as the urban wildflower, is a resilient plant species that thrives in urban environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, colorful blossoms. It is often found growing in cracks of sidewalks, along roadsides, and in neglected urban spaces. Due to its adaptability, Urbanodoxa is considered an indicator species of urban biodiversity."
