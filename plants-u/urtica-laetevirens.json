    "intro": "Urtica laetevirens, commonly known as the green nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains fine hairs that release irritants, causing a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica laetevirens plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
