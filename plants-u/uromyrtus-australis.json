    "intro": "Uromyrtus australis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and woody structure, which helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Uromyrtus australis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
