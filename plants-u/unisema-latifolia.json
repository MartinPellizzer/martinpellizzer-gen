    "intro": "Unisema latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed unisema, is a species characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are often large, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife species."
