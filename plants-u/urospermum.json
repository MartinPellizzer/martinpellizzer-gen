    "intro": "Urospermum, commonly known as the goatweed or yellow star-thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and many species are found in arid and semi-arid regions. Urospermum species typically have hairy stems, lance-shaped leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. They are often considered invasive in some regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. The plant's name comes from the Greek words \"uro-\" meaning urine and \"spermos\" meaning seed, referring to its historical use in treating urinary disorders."
