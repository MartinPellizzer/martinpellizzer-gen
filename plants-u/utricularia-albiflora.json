    "intro": "Utricularia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in marshes and shallow water bodies. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. Utricularia albiflora plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem by capturing and digesting small aquatic organisms."
