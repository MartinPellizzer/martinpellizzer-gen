    "intro": "Uraria styracifolia, commonly known as the Indian strangleberry, is a climbing legume native to South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas and can form dense thickets, which can be invasive in certain environments. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
