    "intro": "Urostigma longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved urostigma, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in the spring. Urostigma longifolium is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
