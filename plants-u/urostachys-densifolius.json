    "intro": "Urostachys densifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in China. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Urostachys densifolius is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
