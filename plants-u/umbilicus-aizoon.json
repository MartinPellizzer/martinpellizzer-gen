    "intro": "Umbilicus aizoon, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence, which resembles a star or wheel. The plant features a short, thick stem with narrow, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small white or yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Umbilicus aizoon is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
