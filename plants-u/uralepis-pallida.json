    "intro": "Uralepis pallida, commonly known as the pale uralepis, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense spike, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Uralepis pallida is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
