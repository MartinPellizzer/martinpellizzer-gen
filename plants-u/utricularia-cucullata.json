It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia cucullata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions."
