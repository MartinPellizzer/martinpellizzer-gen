It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to withstand the humid tropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Unona leytensis is considered a vulnerable species."
