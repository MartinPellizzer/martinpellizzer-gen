    "intro": "Uvaria narum var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed uvaria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often larger than those of the typical Uvaria narum. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture and botanical gardens."
