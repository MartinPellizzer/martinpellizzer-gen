    "intro": "Urelytrum vanderystii, commonly known as Vanderyst's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the Lentibulariaceae family. It is characterized by its specialized bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor wetland environments, where it supplements its nutrient intake through prey capture. Its roots are often submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects. Urelytrum vanderystii is native to parts of Africa and is an example of the adaptive strategies employed by carnivorous plants in low-nutrient habitats."
