    "intro": "Ulmus pumila var. suberosa, commonly known as the Japanese cliff elm, is a variant of the Chinese elm native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or slopes. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round samaras that disperse by wind. This hardy species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
