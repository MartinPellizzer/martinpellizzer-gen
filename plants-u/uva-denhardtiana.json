It is a member of the Vitaceae family, which includes other well-known vines such as grapes and Virginia creeper. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are clustered in small inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a velvety texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Uva denhardtiana is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
