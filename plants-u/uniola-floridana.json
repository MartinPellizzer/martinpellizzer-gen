    "intro": "Uniola floridana, commonly known as Florida grass or flatsear grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
