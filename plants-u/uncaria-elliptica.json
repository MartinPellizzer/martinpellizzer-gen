    "intro": "Uncaria elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical cat's claw, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and hook-shaped thorns. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, hence the species name, and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is valued for its potential medicinal properties, though its use is less widespread compared to other cat's claw species."
