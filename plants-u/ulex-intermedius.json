    "intro": "Ulex intermedius, commonly known as the common bladder campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features upright, branching stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by bladder-like seed pods that burst to disperse seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Ulex intermedius is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas."
