    "intro": "Utricularia simplex, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats across the globe. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizoids for anchorage. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, often arranged in clusters. Utricularia simplex is a highly adaptable species, capable of thriving in a variety of aquatic environments."
