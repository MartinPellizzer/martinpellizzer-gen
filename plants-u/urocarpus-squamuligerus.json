    "intro": "Urocarpus squamuligerus, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Urocarpus squamuligerus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
