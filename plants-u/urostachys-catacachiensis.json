    "intro": "Urostachys catacachiensis, commonly known as the Catacachi grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its botanical structure includes fibrous roots and a compact inflorescence that produces small, spikelet-like flowers. Urostachys catacachiensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its high-altitude habitat."
