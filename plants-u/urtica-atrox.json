    "intro": "Urtica atrox, commonly known as the giant nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants that cause a painful rash upon contact. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Urtica atrox is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
