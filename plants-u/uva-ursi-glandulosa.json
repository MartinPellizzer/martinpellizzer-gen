    "intro": "Uva-ursi glandulosa, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Europe. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in tiny, glandular dots, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound used in traditional medicine for urinary tract support. Uva-ursi glandulosa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
