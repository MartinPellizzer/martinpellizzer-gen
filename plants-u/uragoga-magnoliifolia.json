    "intro": "Uragoga magnoliifolia, commonly known as the white magnolia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that resemble those of the magnolia genus, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its white blooms. Uragoga magnoliifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
