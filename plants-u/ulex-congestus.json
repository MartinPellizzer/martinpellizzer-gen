    "intro": "Ulex congestus, commonly known as the common sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, yellowish-green stems and small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, round, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Ulex congestus is well adapted to salty, windy environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
