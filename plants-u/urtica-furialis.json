    "intro": "Urtica furialis, commonly known as the common nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants that cause a painful reaction upon contact. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in woodland edges. Urtica furialis plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
