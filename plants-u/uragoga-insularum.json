    "intro": "Uragoga insularum, commonly known as the island hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and is often found growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Uragoga insularum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
