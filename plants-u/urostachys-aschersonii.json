    "intro": "Urostachys aschersonii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Urostachys aschersonii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
