    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf field elm, is a variant of the field elm native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are usually longer and wider than those of the typical field elm. The tree typically grows as a small to medium-sized deciduous tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often found in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils."
