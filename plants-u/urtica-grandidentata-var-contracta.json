    "intro": "Urtica grandidentata var. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smaller, more narrow leaves compared to the typical Urtica grandidentata, and it often grows in moist, wooded areas. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing skin irritation in humans. Its flowers are small and greenish, appearing in clusters, and it is often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
