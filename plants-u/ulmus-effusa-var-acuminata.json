    "intro": "Ulmus effusa var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elm, is a variant of the Chinese elm. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard Ulmus effusa. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and thrives in temperate climates. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a rounded or irregular crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
