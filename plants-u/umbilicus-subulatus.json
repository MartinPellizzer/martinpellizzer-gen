    "intro": "Umbilicus subulatus, commonly known as the needleleaf umbilicus, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring and early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
