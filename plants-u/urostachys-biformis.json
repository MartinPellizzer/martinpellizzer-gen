    "intro": "Urostachys biformis, commonly known as the two-form grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed florets, giving it its specific epithet \"biformis.\" Urostachys biformis thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
