It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and heart-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is typically found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by various insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
