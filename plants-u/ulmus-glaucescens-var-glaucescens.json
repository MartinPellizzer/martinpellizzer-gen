    "intro": "Ulmus glaucescens var. glaucescens, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a hardy and adaptable species. Its slow growth rate and resistance to urban conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
