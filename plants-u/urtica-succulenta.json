    "intro": "Urtica succulenta, commonly known as the succulent nettle, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other nettle species, though it differs in its succulent traits. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs that can cause mild irritation upon contact. Urtica succulenta typically produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
