    "intro": "Urtica cannabina, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a skin reaction when touched. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, nitrogen-rich soils. Urtica cannabina is both a weed and a valuable plant used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
