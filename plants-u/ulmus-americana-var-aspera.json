    "intro": "Ulmus americana var. aspera, commonly known as the American winged elm, is a variant of the American elm characterized by its distinctive winged branches. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The tree has rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated margins. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. This variety is more resistant to Dutch elm disease compared to the common American elm, making it a valuable ornamental and ecological species."
