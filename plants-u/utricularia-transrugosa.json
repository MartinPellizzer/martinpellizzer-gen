    "intro": "Utricularia transrugosa, commonly known as the rugose bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture microscopic prey. These structures are typically less than a millimeter in size and are used to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water environments. Utricularia transrugosa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes."
