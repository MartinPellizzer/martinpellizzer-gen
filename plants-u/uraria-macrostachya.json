    "intro": "Uraria macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stalked uraria, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated stipules and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in open woodland or grassland areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage in certain ecological contexts."
