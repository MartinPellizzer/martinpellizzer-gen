    "intro": "Uragoga popayensis, commonly known as the Popay\u00e1n orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Andean region of Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a complex array of colors, typically ranging from white to deep purple. The plant prefers high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, humus-filled soil of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Uragoga popayensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
