    "intro": "Utricularia ceratophylloides, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients it cannot acquire from the water alone. Utricularia ceratophylloides is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in marshy or pond environments."
