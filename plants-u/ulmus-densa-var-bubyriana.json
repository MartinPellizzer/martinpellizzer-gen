    "intro": "Ulmus densa var. bubyriana, commonly known as the Bubyriana elm, is a rare and ancient variety of elm native to central Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in European botany. Due to its susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it is now rare in the wild."
