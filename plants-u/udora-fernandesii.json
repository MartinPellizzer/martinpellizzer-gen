    "intro": "Udora fernandesii, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Udora fernandesii is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this rare species."
