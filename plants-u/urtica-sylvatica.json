It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains tiny, venomous hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. Urtica sylvatica belongs to the Urticaceae family and produces small greenish-white flowers. It is often found in moist, shady areas and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
