It is native to parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The tree is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often glossy and have a smooth margin. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. The wood of Ulmus simplicidens is valued for its fine grain and is used in traditional woodworking and furniture making."
