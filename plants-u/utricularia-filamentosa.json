    "intro": "Utricularia filamentosa, commonly known as the filamentous bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant is typically found in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are often filamentous, contributing to its common name. Utricularia filamentosa exhibits rapid growth and can spread through both vegetative propagation and seed dispersal."
