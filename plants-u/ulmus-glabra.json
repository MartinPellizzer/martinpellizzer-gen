    "intro": "Ulmus glabra, commonly known as the slippery elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark that becomes deeply furrowed with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy underside, giving the tree its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring followed by winged samaras. The tree is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly the mucilage found in its inner bark."
