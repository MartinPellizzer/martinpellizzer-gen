    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 chaterorum, commonly known as the Chater's elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the European elm (Ulmus minor) and the American elm (Ulmus americana). It is a medium-sized tree with a broad, spreading crown and a trunk that often develops a distinctive fluted appearance. The leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain one or two seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to certain diseases compared to its parent species."
