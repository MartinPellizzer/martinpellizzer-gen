    "intro": "Unona musaria, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, Unona musaria is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
