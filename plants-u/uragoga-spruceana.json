    "intro": "Uragoga spruceana, commonly known as the Sierra spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Uragoga spruceana thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in forest ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
