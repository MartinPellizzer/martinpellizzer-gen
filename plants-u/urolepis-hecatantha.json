    "intro": "Urolepis hecatantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass or African grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
