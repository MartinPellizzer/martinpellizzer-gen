It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. Utricularia phusoidaoensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
