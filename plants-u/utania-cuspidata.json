    "intro": "Utania cuspidata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and canyons. Its hardy nature makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Utania cuspidata plays a role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
