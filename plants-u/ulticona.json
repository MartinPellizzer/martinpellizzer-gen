    "intro": "Ulticona, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy petals that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant's unique structure includes a central stem with spiraling, leaf-like appendages that resemble tendrils. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Ulticona is considered a highly endangered species."
