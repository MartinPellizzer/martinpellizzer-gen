    "intro": "Ulex ericetarum, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a perennial shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, oval berries that turn black when mature. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland edges. Ulex ericetarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows."
