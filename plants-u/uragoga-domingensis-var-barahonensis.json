    "intro": "Uragoga domingensis var. barahonensis, commonly known as the Barahonensis Uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
