It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, giving it its common name. Urtica cymosa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
