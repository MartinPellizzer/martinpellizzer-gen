    "intro": "Urtica pinnatifida, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release formic acid when touched, causing a skin irritation. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica pinnatifida is also known for its nutritional value, containing high levels of protein, iron, and vitamins."
