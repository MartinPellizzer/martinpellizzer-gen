    "intro": "Unciferia segoviensis, commonly known as the Segovia orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its delicate, terrestrial growth habit and features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption, and it has a short flowering period, usually in spring. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
