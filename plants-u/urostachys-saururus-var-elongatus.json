    "intro": "Urostachys saururus var. elongatus, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, which bloom during the summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. This variant is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
