    "intro": "Ulmus microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Ulmus microphylla is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
