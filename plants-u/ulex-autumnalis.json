    "intro": "Ulex autumnalis, commonly known as the Scottish heath or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Britain and northern Europe. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal dunes or heathland habitats. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in dense, spiny heads. Its leaves are needle-like and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature. Ulex autumnalis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
