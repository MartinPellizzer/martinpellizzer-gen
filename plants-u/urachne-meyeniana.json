    "intro": "Urachne meyeniana, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Urachne meyeniana is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
