    "intro": "Ulmus foliacea var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elm, is a variant of the common elm characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas. The leaves are elongated and have a distinctive, serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in urban environments."
