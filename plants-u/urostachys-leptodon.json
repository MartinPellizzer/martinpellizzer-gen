    "intro": "Urostachys leptodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to arid and rocky environments in Asia. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Urostachys leptodon is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
