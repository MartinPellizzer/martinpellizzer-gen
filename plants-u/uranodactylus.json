    "intro": "Uranodactylus, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature a yellow or golden center surrounded by contrasting colors. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. The botanical features of Uranodactylus make it a popular subject in both horticultural and scientific studies."
