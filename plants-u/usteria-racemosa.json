It is a perennial herb that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in tidal zones and rocky shores. The plant has aromatic, finely divided leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal fluctuations. Usteria racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
