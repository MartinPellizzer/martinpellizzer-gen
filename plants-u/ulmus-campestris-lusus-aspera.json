    "intro": "Ulmus campestris lusus aspera, commonly known as the rough field elm, is a variant of the field elm native to parts of Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves with doubly serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse via wind. This species is relatively hardy but susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
