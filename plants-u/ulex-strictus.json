    "intro": "Ulex strictus, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in sandy or disturbed soils. Ulex strictus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
