    "intro": "Uva angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grape or Spanish grape, is a species of flowering plant in the Vitaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in rocky or limestone soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and small, elliptical leaves with a pointed tip. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature. Uva angustifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can also be cultivated for its edible fruits."
