    "intro": "Ulmus glabra subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain elm, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough texture and a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
