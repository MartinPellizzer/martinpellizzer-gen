    "intro": "Ulex opistholepis, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Ulex opistholepis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
