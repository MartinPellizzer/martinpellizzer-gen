    "intro": "Ulmus suberosa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved hackberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas."
