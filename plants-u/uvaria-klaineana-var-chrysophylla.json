It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking golden yellow during the dry season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, round berries that are yellow when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
