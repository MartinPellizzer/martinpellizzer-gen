    "intro": "Ulmus viscosa, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and tolerance to urban conditions. Ulmus viscosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively disease-resistant nature."
