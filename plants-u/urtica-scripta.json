    "intro": "Urtica scripta, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica scripta thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. Its growth habit includes erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with a fibrous root system that helps it establish in various habitats."
