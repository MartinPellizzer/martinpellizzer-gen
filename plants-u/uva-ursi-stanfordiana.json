    "intro": "Uva-ursi stanfordiana, commonly known as the Stanford bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Uva-ursi stanfordiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
