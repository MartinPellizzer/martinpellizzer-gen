It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas and along roadsides."
