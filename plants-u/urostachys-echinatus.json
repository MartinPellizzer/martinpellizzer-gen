    "intro": "Urostachys echinatus, commonly known as the spiked cushion grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Urostachys echinatus is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
