    "intro": "Urtica monoica, commonly known as the single-stem nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine hairs that cause an itchy reaction upon contact. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Urtica monoica is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges."
