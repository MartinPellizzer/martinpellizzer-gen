    "intro": "Utricularia affinis var. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap aquatic prey, enabling the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has slender, branched stems covered in tiny, leaf-like structures. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive two-lipped structure typical of the family. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
