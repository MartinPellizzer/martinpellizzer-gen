    "intro": "Urtica floribunda, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems covered in stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped, serrated, and often have a slightly fuzzy texture. Urtica floribunda is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
