    "intro": "Ulmus campestris subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading crown with heart-shaped leaves. The bark is gray and fissured, with a rough texture that becomes more pronounced with age. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is known for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease."
