    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. diplotricha, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. Urtica dioica var. diplotricha is a dioecious species, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants."
