It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptic or ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are typically followed by bright red, star-shaped berries. Uvaria boniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its fruit, while not widely consumed commercially, is sometimes used in local cuisines and remedies."
