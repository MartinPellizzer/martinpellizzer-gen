It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Its flowers are often pale blue or purple, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind.
