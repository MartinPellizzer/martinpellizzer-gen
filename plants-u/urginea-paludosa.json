    "intro": "Urginea paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bulb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features a large, fleshy underground bulb that serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. The plant produces tall, leafless stems that bear clusters of white or pale purple flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, adapted to thrive in moist, swampy environments. Urginea paludosa is often found in areas with poor drainage, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
