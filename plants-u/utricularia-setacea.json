    "intro": "Utricularia setacea, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on its specialized structures to obtain essential nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Utricularia setacea is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of wetland habitats."
