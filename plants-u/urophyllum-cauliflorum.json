    "intro": "Urophyllum cauliflorum, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of tropical and subtropical areas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline and arid environments. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems that often grow close to the ground. Urophyllum cauliflorum is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
