    "intro": "Urochloa turbinata, commonly known as the turban grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive turban-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Urochloa turbinata is used in some regions for forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature."
