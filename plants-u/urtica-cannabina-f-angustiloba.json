    "intro": "Urtica cannabina f. angustiloba, commonly known as narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is known for its fine hairs that release irritating chemicals upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and it is often found in temperate regions. This variety is sometimes cultivated for its nutritional value, as its young leaves can be cooked and eaten."
