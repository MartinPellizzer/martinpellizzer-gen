    "intro": "Uragoga butaensis, commonly known as the Butaensis Uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
