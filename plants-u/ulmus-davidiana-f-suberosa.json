    "intro": "Ulmus davidiana f. suberosa, commonly known as the Chinese cliff elm, is a unique variant of the David's elm. It is characterized by its gnarled, twisted trunk and thick, flaky bark, which gives it a rugged appearance. This form is typically found growing on rocky slopes and cliffs, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. The leaves are small, oval, and have a slightly serrated edge, often turning yellow in the autumn. It is a slow-growing tree that is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
