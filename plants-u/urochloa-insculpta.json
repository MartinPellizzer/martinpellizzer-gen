    "intro": "Urochloa insculpta, commonly known as the finely-veined grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with prominent, finely spaced veins. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Urochloa insculpta is valued for its use in livestock forage and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
