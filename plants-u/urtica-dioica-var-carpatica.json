    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. carpatica, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that release histamine and formic acid when touched. The plant typically grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with smooth, hollow stems and small greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has been used historically for its nutritional value and in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
