    "intro": "Uvaria ligularis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed uvaria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Uvaria ligularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its growth habit makes it suitable for use in shaded garden settings or as part of greenery in tropical landscapes."
