    "intro": "Urtica spicigera, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it is known for its stinging hairs that release formic acid when touched. Urtica spicigera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
