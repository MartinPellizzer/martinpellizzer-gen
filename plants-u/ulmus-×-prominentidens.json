    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 prominentidens, commonly known as the Chinese field elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ulmus parvifolia and Ulmus laciniata. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Its adaptability makes it a common ornamental and shade tree in parts of Asia."
