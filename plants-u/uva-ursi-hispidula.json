    "intro": "Uva-ursi hispidula, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in woodland and heathland environments. Uva-ursi hispidula is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
