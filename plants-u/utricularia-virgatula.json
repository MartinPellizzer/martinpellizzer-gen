    "intro": "Utricularia virgatula, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to capture small aquatic organisms. Utricularia virgatula is often found in nutrient-poor environments, where it supplements its nutrient intake through captured prey."
