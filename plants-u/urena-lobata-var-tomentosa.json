    "intro": "Urena lobata var. tomentosa, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to the Americas, particularly thriving in warm, humid climates. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its hairy foliage and robust growth make it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. Urena lobata var. tomentosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
