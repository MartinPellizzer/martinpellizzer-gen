    "intro": "Urtica tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian nettle, is a perennial herb native to Tasmania and parts of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a rash upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and a dense covering of fine hairs. Urtica tasmanica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
