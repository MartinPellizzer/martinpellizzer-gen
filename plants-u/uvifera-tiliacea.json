    "intro": "Uvifera tiliacea, commonly known as the common sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits known as samaras. Uvifera tiliacea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and in woodland areas. It is valued for its rapid growth and historical use in timber production."
