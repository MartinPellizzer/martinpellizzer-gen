    "intro": "Uromyrtus supraaxillaris, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by distinctive, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Uromyrtus supraaxillaris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
