    "intro": "Utricularia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepalese bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically whorled and have specialized structures for attachment to substrates. Utricularia nepalensis plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation."
