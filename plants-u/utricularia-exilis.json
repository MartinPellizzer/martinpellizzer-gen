    "intro": "Utricularia exilis, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as trap organs to capture small aquatic prey. This species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Utricularia exilis is a carnivorous plant that relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters. Its delicate appearance and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
