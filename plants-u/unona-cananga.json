It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and emit a sweet, intoxicating scent. The plant has a succulent, branching structure with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths.
