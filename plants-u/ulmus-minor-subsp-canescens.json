    "intro": "Ulmus minor subsp. canescens, commonly known as the white elm, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u20138 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and urban landscapes."
