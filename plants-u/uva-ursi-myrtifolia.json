    "intro": "Uva-ursi myrtifolia, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds such as arbutin, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Uva-ursi myrtifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
