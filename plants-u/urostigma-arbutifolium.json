    "intro": "Urostigma arbutifolium, commonly known as the bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Urostigma arbutifolium is also known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
