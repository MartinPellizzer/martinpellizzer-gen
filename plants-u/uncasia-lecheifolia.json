    "intro": "Uncasia lecheifolia, commonly known as the milkweed of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its most distinctive feature is the milky sap it exudes, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Uncasia lecheifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas of mountainous regions."
