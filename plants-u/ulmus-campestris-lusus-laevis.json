    "intro": "Ulmus campestris lusus laevis, commonly known as the European field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and slightly lobed. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along riverbanks. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
