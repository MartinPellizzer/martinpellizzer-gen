    "intro": "Uapaca paludosa, commonly known as the swamp kola, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain several seeds. Uapaca paludosa is typically found in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems."
