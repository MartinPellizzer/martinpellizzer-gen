    "intro": "Uruparia acida, commonly known as sour wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Uruparia acida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
