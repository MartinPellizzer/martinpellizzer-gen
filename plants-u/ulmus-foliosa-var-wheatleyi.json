    "intro": "Ulmus foliosa var. wheatleyi, commonly known as the Desert Willow, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, round fruits that split open to release its seeds. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
