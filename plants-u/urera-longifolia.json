    "intro": "Urera longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf urera, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Urera longifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
