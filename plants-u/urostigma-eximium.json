    "intro": "Urostigma eximium, commonly known as the goldenstar milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Urostigma eximium is often found in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
