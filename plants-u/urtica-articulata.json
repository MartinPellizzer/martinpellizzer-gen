    "intro": "Urtica articulata, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features hollow, hairless stems that are covered in fine, stinging hairs called trichomes, which release irritants when touched. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Urtica articulata is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in woodland areas."
