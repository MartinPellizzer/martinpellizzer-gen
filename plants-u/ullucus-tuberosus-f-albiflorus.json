    "intro": "Ullucus tuberosus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered ullucu, is a variant of the ullucu plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast with its typical purple or red blooms in the species. The plant produces tuberous roots that are used in traditional Andean cuisine, though the white-flowered form is less commonly cultivated. Botanically, it belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and shares features with other Andean tubers like the oca and mashua. Its ornamental value has led to increased interest in its cultivation for both agricultural and horticultural purposes."
