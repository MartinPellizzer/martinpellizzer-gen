It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges and grassy areas. Ulex vernalis is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
