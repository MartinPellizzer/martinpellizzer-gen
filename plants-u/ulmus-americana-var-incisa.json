    "intro": "Ulmus americana var. incisa, commonly known as the American elm variant with incised leaves, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that have distinctive incisions, giving it a unique appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a tall, slender trunk and a spreading, vase-like crown. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This variant is less common than the standard American elm due to its limited range and susceptibility to Dutch elm disease."
