    "intro": "Uvularia puberula, commonly known as the downy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a soft, downy appearance, which is reflected in its scientific name. Uvularia puberula is often found in shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
