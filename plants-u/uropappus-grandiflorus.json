    "intro": "Uropappus grandiflorus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Uropappus grandiflorus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
