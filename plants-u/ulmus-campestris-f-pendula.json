    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping field elm, is a striking cultivar of the field elm. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for urban landscapes. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many areas."
