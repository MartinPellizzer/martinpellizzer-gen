    "intro": "Ulex baeticus f. bourgaeanus, commonly known as the Bourgaean's sea holly, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and sturdy. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
