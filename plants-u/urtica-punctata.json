The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, disturbed soils. Urtica punctata produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators. Its leaves and stems have been used historically in traditional medicine and culinary practices."
