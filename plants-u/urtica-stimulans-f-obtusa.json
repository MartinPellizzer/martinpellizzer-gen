    "intro": "Urtica stimulans f. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species characterized by its broader leaves and shorter, less pronounced stinging hairs. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated edge, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The plant contains irritants in its hairs, which can cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin. It is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
