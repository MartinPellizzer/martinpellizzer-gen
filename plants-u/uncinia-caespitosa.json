    "intro": "Uncinia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Uncinia caespitosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environments."
