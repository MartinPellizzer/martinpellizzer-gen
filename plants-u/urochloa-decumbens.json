    "intro": "Urochloa decumbens, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface. Urochloa decumbens is drought-tolerant and often used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
