    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica var. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-veined elm, is a cultivar of the wych elm, characterized by its striking variegated foliage. Its leaves display a unique combination of white, yellow, and green, creating a visually appealing contrast against the dark bark. The tree is a hybrid between Ulmus glabra and Ulmus minor, resulting in a hardy and relatively disease-resistant specimen. It typically grows to a moderate height, making it suitable for smaller gardens or urban landscapes. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, leading to its distinctive appearance."
