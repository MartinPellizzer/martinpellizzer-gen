It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is known for its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing skin irritation. This form is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
