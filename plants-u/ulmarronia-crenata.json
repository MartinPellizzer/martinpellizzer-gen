    "intro": "Ulmarronia crenata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy or velvety in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Ulmarronia crenata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. It is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
