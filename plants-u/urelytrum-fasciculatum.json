    "intro": "Urelytrum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, with short, branched stems. Urelytrum fasciculatum is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to the food web and water filtration."
