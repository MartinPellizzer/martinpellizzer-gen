    "intro": "Urtica spirealis var. ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive stinging hair structure. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, the plant is known for its irritant hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
