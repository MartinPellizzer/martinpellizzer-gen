    "intro": "Ulex microclada, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with stiff, hooked hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, glandular hairs. Ulex microclada is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
