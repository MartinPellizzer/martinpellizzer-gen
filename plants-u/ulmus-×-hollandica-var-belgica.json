    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica var. belgica, commonly known as the Belgian elm, is a hybrid species within the elm genus, resulting from the cross between the wych elm and the English elm. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark, fissured bark that becomes more prominent with age. The tree produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically slightly hairy on the underside. It is a deciduous species, shedding its leaves in the autumn, and is known for its moderate growth rate. The Belgian elm is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively resistant to certain diseases compared to other elm species."
