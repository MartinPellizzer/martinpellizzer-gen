    "intro": "Uva-ursi manzanita, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for humans but are particularly favored by wildlife, including bears. Botanically, it belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes other familiar plants like blueberries and heathers. Its compact form and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils make it a common sight in chaparral and woodland habitats."
