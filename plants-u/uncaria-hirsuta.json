    "intro": "Uncaria hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy cat's claw, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and hirsute (hairy) appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and red, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with serrated margins. Uncaria hirsuta is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
