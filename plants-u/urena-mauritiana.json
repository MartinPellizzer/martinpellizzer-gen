    "intro": "Urena mauritiana, commonly known as Indian hemp or velvetleaf, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Urena mauritiana is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, due to its adaptability to various soil types. It is also known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
