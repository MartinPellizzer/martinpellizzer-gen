    "intro": "Uragoga reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, net-like pattern of veins. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Uragoga reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
