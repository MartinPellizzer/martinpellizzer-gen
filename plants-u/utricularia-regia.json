    "intro": "Utricularia regia, commonly known as the Royal Bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia regia is known for its delicate appearance and unique method of nutrient acquisition."
