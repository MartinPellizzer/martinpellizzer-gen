    "intro": "Uniola laxa, commonly known as coastal grass or sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy and saline soils, making it an important component of coastal dune ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in coastal areas."
