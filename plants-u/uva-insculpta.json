    "intro": "Uva insculpta, commonly known as the engraved grape, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique, sculpted leaves that resemble intricate engravings, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by dark blue or black berries. Uva insculpta thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
