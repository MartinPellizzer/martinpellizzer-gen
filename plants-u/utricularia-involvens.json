    "intro": "Utricularia involvens, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its roots are often submerged, and it produces small, delicate flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Utricularia involvens is a fascinating example of plant adaptation to aquatic habitats."
