    "intro": "Ulmus montana var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple cliff-elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive dark purple to black bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns reddish-purple in autumn. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged samaras. This variety is valued for its ornamental bark and is often used in rock gardens or as a specimen plant in horticulture."
