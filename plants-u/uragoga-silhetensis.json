    "intro": "Uragoga silhetensis, commonly known as the Silhetensis fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the hills of Bangladesh. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
