    "intro": "Ulmus aquatica, commonly known as the water elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
