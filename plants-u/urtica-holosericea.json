    "intro": "Urtica holosericea, commonly known as the velvetleaf nettle, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica holosericea thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its hairy stems and leaves can cause skin irritation upon contact, making it a common allergen."
