    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus f. discolor, commonly known as the white scurvygrass, is a variant of the common sea holly. It is a low-growing, perennial plant characterized by its distinctive white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in coastal environments, particularly on sandy or gravelly soils. Its foliage consists of small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This form is notable for its reduced floral display compared to the typical species, making it a unique and less common variant in botanical collections."
