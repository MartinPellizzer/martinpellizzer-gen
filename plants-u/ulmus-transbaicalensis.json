    "intro": "Ulmus transbaicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in the Transbaikal area of Russia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic to ovate in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round samaras that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in forested areas along river valleys."
