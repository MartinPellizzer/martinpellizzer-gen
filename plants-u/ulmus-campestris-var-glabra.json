    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions and full sun. This species is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban environments."
