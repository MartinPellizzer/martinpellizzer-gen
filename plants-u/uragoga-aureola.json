    "intro": "Uragoga aureola, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a star-like pattern, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Uragoga aureola is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
