    "intro": "Ulbrichia beatensis, commonly known as the Beatensia tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in late spring. Ulbrichia beatensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
