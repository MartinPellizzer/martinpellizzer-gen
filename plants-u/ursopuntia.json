    "intro": "Ursopuntia, commonly known as the bear cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and is covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and cold temperatures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its fuzzy exterior. Ursopuntia is adapted to arid and rocky environments, with spines that provide both protection and shade. Its slow growth rate and distinctive appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
