    "intro": "Urocarpidium jacens, commonly known as the creeping bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Urocarpidium jacens is also notable for its ability to capture small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures, aiding in its nutrient acquisition."
