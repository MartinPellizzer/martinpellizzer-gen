    "intro": "Umbilicus tuberculosus, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its flowers are small and usually pink or purple in color. Umbilicus tuberculosus is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to trap and digest prey."
