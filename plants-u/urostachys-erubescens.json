    "intro": "Urostachys erubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, branching stems that are typically reddish in color, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Urostachys erubescens is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
