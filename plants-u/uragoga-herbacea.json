    "intro": "Uragoga herbacea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically producing spores rather than seeds. Due to habitat destruction, Uragoga herbacea is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
