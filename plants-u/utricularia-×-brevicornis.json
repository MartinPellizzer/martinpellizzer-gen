    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 brevicornis, commonly known as the narrow-horned bladderwort, is a hybrid aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used for capturing prey, which are a key adaptation for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. It has delicate, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, pale yellow flowers. Due to its hybrid nature, Utricularia \u00d7 brevicornis exhibits variability in morphology and is often found in regions where its parent species co-occur."
