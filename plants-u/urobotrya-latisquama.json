    "intro": "Urobotrya latisquama, commonly known as the broad-scale lichen, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae. It is a saxicolous lichen, typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is foliose, with a distinctive broad, scale-like structure that gives it its common name. It is characterized by a yellowish to orange-brown color and a lecanorine type of thallus. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
