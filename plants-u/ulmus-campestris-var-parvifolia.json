    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved field elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a common ornamental and ecological plant in temperate regions."
