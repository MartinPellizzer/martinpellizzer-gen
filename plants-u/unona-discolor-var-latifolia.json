    "intro": "Unona discolor var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf white wood fern, is a variant of the white wood fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a whitish or silvery bloom. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
