    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. mitissima, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which release irritating chemicals upon contact. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica dioica var. mitissima is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its anti-inflammatory and nutritional benefits."
