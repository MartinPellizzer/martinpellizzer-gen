    "intro": "Ulmus glabra var. montana, commonly known as the mountain elm, is a variant of the winged elm native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The tree has a slender, often multi-trunked form with smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. The mountain elm produces small, pendulous catkins and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
