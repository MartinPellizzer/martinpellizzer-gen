    "intro": "Utricularia inthanonensis, commonly known as the Thai Bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to Thailand. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture tiny aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies and has delicate, floating leaves. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with a unique structure that aids in pollination. Utricularia inthanonensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling algae and small invertebrate populations."
