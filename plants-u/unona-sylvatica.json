    "intro": "Unona sylvatica, commonly known as the forest unona, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, oval berries that ripen to a dark red color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge, often with a slightly aromatic scent. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
