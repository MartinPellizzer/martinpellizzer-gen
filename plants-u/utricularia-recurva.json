    "intro": "Utricularia recurva, commonly known as the curling bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia recurva is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
