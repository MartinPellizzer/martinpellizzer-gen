    "intro": "Urostigma fagineum, commonly known as the black alder. It is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its dark, almost black bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Urostigma fagineum thrives in wet or moist soils, often found near rivers or in swampy areas."
