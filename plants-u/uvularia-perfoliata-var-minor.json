    "intro": "Uvularia perfoliata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser perfoliate bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive perfoliate leaves, which are arranged in a rosette and have a unique appearance with a central hole. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
