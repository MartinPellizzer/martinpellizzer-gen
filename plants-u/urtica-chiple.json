    "intro": "Urtica chiple, commonly known as the stinging nettle of the Andes, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettle species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, irritating hairs that release histamine upon contact. Urtica chiple thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
