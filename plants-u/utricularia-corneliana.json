    "intro": "Utricularia corneliana, commonly known as the Cornelian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake. Utricularia corneliana is native to regions in Africa and is often found in marshes and slow-moving streams."
