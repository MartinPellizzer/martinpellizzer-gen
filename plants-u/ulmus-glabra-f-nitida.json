    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. nitida, commonly known as the European Wych Elm, is a cultivar of the Wych Elm, characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, pale bark. It is a deciduous tree that typically reaches heights of 15 to 25 meters, with a narrow, columnar shape that makes it suitable for small gardens or urban settings. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in autumn. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in landscaping for its elegant form and seasonal interest. However, it is susceptible to elm diseases such as Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions."
