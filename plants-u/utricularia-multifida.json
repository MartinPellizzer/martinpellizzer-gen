    "intro": "Utricularia multifida, commonly known as the multifid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in wet, nutrient-poor environments. The plant features small, delicate leaves with numerous branches, and it produces tiny, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are borne on slender, erect stems. Utricularia multifida is an epiphytic species, often growing on the surfaces of other plants or submerged in water."
