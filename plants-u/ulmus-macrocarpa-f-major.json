    "intro": "Ulmus macrocarpa f. major, commonly known as the American elm, is a cultivar of the American elm tree native to the United States. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, spreading canopy, which gives it a distinctive and graceful appearance. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture on the underside. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in urban landscapes. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has greatly reduced its population in the wild."
