    "intro": "Ulmus vulgaris proles minor, commonly known as the small-leaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the common elm. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its smaller size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
