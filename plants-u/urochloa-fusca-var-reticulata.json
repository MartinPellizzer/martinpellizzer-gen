    "intro": "Urochloa fusca var. reticulata, commonly known as hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and have a bluish-green color, while the inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small florets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for pasture and erosion control. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to regrow quickly after grazing."
