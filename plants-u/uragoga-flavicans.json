    "intro": "Uragoga flavicans, commonly known as the yellow-flowered uragoga, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in panicles, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, fibrous capsule that contains seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Uragoga flavicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
