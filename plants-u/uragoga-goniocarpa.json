    "intro": "Uragoga goniocarpa, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical plant native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a dense canopy and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by yellow, star-shaped fruits, which are edible and have a sweet, juicy pulp. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly rough texture, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine."
