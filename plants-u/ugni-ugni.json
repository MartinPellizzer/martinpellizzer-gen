    "intro": "Ugni ugni, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces bright red, strawberry-like fruits that are edible but often have a tart, acidic flavor. Ugni ugni is well adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist climates. Its unique appearance and seasonal fruiting make it a notable ornamental plant in its native habitat."
