    "intro": "Uncaria tomentosa var. dioica, commonly known as the Amazonian cat's claw, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often found growing along forest edges and in shaded understories. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the humid, nutrient-poor environments of tropical rainforests."
