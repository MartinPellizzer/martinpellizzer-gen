    "intro": "Urostigma infectorium, commonly known as the poison hemlock, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant contains toxic compounds such as cicutoxin and \u03b3-conicein, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in woodland edges. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
