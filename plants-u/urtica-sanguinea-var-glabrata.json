    "intro": "Urtica sanguinea var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth red nettle, is a variant of the red nettle species characterized by its glabrous (hairless) stems. It is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly regions in China and India. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological traits and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
