    "intro": "Utricularia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia pubescens typically grows in dense mats and is often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its hairy appearance, due to fine pubescence on its stems and leaves, is a distinguishing feature."
