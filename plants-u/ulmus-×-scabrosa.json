    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 scabrosa, commonly known as the European wych elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the wych elm (Ulmus glabra) and the English elm (Ulmus procera). It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and drooping branches, often forming a narrow, weeping shape. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface. This species is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value in parks and gardens. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions."
