    "intro": "Uragoga amicorum, commonly known as the friendship orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy blooms. Uragoga amicorum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
