    "intro": "Ulmus cebennensis, commonly known as the European wych elm, is a species of elm native to Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The bark is gray and fissured, while the leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. This species is known for its resilience but has been affected by Dutch elm disease."
