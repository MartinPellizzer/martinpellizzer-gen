    "intro": "Umbilicus giganteus, commonly known as the giant bellybutton plant, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. Its unique appearance, resembling a giant belly button, has earned it its common name. Umbilicus giganteus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
