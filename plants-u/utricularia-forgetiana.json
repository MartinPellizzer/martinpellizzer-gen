    "intro": "Utricularia forgetiana, commonly known as the Indian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders attached to the leaf tips. Utricularia forgetiana is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and unique predatory behavior."
