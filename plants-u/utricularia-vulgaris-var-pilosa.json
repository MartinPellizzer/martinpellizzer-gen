    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies such as ponds and marshes. The plant's unique adaptations allow it to thrive in environments where traditional nutrients are scarce."
