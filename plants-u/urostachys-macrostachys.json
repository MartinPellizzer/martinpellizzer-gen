    "intro": "Urostachys macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stemmed sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, adapting it to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
