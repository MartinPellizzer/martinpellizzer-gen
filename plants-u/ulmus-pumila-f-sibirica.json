It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions, making it adaptable to various soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by samaras, which are winged seeds dispersed by the wind. This species is often used in reforestation projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits."
