    "intro": "Uva-ursi procumbens var. coactilis, commonly known as the creeping bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in extreme climates."
