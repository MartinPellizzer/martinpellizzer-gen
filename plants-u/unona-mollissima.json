    "intro": "Unona mollissima, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by oval, woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it both ecologically significant and agriculturally problematic."
