It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate rainfall. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in Mediterranean-type ecosystems."
