    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris subsp. macrorhiza, commonly known as the greater bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on its specialized structures for nutrient acquisition. Its leaves are often submerged, with the bladders attached to the stems, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions. This subspecies is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize various aquatic environments."
