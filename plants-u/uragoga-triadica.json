    "intro": "Uragoga triadica, commonly known as Chinese lantern or Physostegia, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads through both rhizomes and seeds, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Uragoga triadica is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
