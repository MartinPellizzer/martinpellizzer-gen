    "intro": "Urostigma littorale, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green leaves, which are adapted to tolerate saline and windy environments. The plant typically grows along shores, dunes, and salt marshes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Urostigma littorale is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
