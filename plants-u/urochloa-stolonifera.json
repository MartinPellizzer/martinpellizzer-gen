    "intro": "Urochloa stolonifera, commonly known as silverleaf buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which involves horizontal stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery appearance due to the fine pubescence on the leaf surfaces. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in lawns and pastures. Urochloa stolonifera is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and its low maintenance requirements."
