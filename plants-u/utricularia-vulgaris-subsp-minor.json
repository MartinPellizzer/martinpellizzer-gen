    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser bladderworts, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used for capturing prey. This subspecies typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it can receive adequate sunlight. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations and providing habitat for microorganisms."
