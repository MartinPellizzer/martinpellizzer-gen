    "intro": "Urostachys squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly flaxflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Its leaves are often covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Urostachys squarrosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
