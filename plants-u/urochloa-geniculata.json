    "intro": "Urochloa geniculata, commonly known as the climbing grass or geniculate grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats or vines. The plant has slender, often twining stems that can climb over other vegetation. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a prominent midrib. Urochloa geniculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its rapid growth and soil stabilization properties."
