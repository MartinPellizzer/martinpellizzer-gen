    "intro": "Utricularia menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that bear specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This aquatic or semi-aquatic plant is native to regions with moist, nutrient-poor environments, such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape. The plant's unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition through predation make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
