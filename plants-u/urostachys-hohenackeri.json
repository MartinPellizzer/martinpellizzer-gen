    "intro": "Urostachys hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
