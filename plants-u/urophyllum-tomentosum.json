    "intro": "Urophyllum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, upright stem covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Urophyllum tomentosum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure."
