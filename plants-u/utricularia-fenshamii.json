    "intro": "Utricularia fenshamii, commonly known as the Fensham's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in wetland environments. The plant features delicate, floating leaves with specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to capture small aquatic organisms. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for studying carnivorous plant adaptations."
