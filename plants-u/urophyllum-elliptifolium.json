    "intro": "Urophyllum elliptifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf star-fruit plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when ripe, often containing a single seed. Urophyllum elliptifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
