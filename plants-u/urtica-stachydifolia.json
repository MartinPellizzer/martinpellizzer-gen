    "intro": "Urtica stachydifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Urtica stachydifolia is known for its stinging hairs, which release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in many people. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
