    "intro": "Urophyllum vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic flame plant, is a rare and striking species native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils and requires high levels of sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
