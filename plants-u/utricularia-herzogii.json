    "intro": "Utricularia herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on these traps for essential nutrients. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia herzogii is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
