    "intro": "Urostachys tenuis, commonly known as the slender leaved saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Urostachys tenuis plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
