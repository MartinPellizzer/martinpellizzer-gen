It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance.

Urena sieberi is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
