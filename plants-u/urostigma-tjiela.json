The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is known for its milky sap, which is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
