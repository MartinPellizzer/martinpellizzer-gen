It is characterized by its smooth, hollow, and cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with serrated edges and also bear stinging hairs. Urtica cylindrica is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks."
