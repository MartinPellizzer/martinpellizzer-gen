    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 cantabrigiensis, commonly known as the Cambridge elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra). It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in urban landscapes. However, like many elm species, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions."
