    "intro": "Uragoga multicostata, commonly known as the broad-ribbed arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are prominently veined and often have a waxy texture. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is often found in swamps or along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Uragoga multicostata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in local cultures."
