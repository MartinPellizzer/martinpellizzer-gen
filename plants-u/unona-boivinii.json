    "intro": "Unona boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Unona boivinii is considered a conservation concern."
