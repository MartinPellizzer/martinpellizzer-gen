It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its historical significance and ornamental value, it has been cultivated for centuries in gardens and parks."
