    "intro": "Urospermum grandiflorum, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Its showy, purple to pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Urospermum grandiflorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
