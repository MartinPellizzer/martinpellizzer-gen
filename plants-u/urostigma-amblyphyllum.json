    "intro": "Urostigma amblyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on leafless stems. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Urostigma amblyphyllum is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent stems and leaves."
