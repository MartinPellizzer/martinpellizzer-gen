    "intro": "Urtica hirsuta, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is known for its stinging hairs that release formic acid when touched. The plant thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and green, clustered in umbels, and it is an important plant in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts. Urtica hirsuta is also a common weed in agricultural settings."
