    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and stagnant water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia vulgaris is typically found in temperate regions and can grow in both freshwater and brackish environments. Its unique method of nutrient acquisition through predation makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
