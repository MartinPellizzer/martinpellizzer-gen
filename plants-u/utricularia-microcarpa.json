    "intro": "Utricularia microcarpa, commonly known as the miniature bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 millimeter in size, which is why it is called the \"miniature bladderwort.\" Utricularia microcarpa is notable for its ability to float on the water surface while maintaining its submerged trapping structures."
