    "intro": "Utricularia thonningii, commonly known as the African bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture microscopic organisms. These utricles are inflated and can be triggered by water movement to expel a jet of water that captures prey. Utricularia thonningii is notable for its rapid growth and unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments."
