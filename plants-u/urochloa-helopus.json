    "intro": "Urochloa helopus, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments due to its salt tolerance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-resistant and can withstand moderate grazing, making it a resilient species in harsh coastal climates. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
