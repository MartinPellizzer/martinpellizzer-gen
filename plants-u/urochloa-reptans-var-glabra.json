    "intro": "Urochloa reptans var. glabra, commonly known as slender blady grass, is a tropical perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands, rice fields, and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
