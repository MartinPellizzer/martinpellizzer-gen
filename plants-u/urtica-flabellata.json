It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes many stinging plants. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. Urtica flabellata produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and often invasive species in its native habitats."
