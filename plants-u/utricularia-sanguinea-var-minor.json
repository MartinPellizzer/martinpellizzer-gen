    "intro": "Utricularia sanguinea var. minor, commonly known as the blood bladder bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture microscopic aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in water or very moist soil, and its leaves are often submerged. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. This variety is less common than the main species and is often found in shaded, nutrient-poor environments."
