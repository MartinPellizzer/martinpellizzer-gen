    "intro": "Ulmus effusa var. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaf elm, is a variant of the Wych elm, characterized by its distinctive rounded leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas. The plant has a tall, straight trunk with a spreading crown, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth margin. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional landscapes."
