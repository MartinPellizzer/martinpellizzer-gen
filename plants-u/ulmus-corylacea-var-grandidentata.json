    "intro": "Ulmus corylacea var. grandidentata, commonly known as the large-toothed elm, is a variant of the American elm native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, serrated leaves that are broader and more pointed than those of the typical American elm. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and a straight, sturdy trunk. Its bark is gray and develops shallow fissures as the tree matures. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in urban landscapes."
