    "intro": "Uragoga britteniana, commonly known as the brittle leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant's leaves are thin and brittle, giving it its common name, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It requires specific soil conditions and high humidity to flourish, making it a challenging plant to cultivate. Due to habitat loss, Uragoga britteniana is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
