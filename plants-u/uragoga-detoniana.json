    "intro": "Uragoga detoniana, commonly known as the explosive orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble small, explosive capsules, which open with a sudden burst to release seeds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat. Its botanical features include a slender stem and lanceolate leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
