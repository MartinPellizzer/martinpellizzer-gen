    "intro": "Urtica trinervia, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Urtica trinervia is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
