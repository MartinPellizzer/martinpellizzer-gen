    "intro": "Urostachys serpyllifolius, commonly known as common sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Urostachys serpyllifolius is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
