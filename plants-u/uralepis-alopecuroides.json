It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is an aquatic or semi-aquatic species, often found in wetland habitats. It has a unique root system that includes both roots and rhizomes, which help it anchor in muddy substrates. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive appearance, with \"alepecuroides\" referring to its woolly texture."
