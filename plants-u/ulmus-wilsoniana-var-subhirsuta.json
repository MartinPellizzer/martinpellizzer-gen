    "intro": "Ulmus wilsoniana var. subhirsuta, commonly known as the hirsute Chinese elm, is a variant of the Chinese elm native to China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The tree produces small, pendulous catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged samaras. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a hardy ornamental tree. Its unique foliage and resilience make it a popular choice for urban landscaping."
