    "intro": "Urtica haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it both a challenging and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
