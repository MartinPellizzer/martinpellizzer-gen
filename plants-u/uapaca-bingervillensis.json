    "intro": "Uapaca bingervillensis, commonly known as the Kibera apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of East Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by edible, yellowish-orange berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and are often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines. Uapaca bingervillensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
