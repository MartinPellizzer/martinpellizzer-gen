    "intro": "Utricularia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia glandulosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
