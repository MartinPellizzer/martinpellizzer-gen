    "intro": "Urostachys orizabae, commonly known as the Mexican feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It features slender, wiry stems that form dense clumps and produce delicate, feathery inflorescences during the spring and summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its fine, silver-gray foliage and light, airy flower plumes. Urostachys orizabae is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
