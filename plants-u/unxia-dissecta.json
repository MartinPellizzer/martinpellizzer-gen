    "intro": "Unxia dissecta, commonly known as the dissected unxia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Unxia dissecta thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
