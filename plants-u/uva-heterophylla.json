    "intro": "Uva heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf vine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves ranging from ovate to linear in shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its stems are often woody and can climb or trail along the ground. Uva heterophylla is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
