It is characterized by its large, showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Urginea ollivieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of resilience in harsh environments."
