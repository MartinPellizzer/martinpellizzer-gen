It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Uvaria monticola is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
