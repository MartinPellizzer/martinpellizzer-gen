    "intro": "Urtica nutans, commonly known as the prostrate nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairless stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation. Urtica nutans is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
