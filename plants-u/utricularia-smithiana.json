    "intro": "Utricularia smithiana, commonly known as the Smith's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are slender and often form a rosette, while its flowers are small and usually yellow or greenish in color. Utricularia smithiana is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
