    "intro": "Urostigma pedunculatum, commonly known as the slender bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The fruit is a slender pod that contains several seeds, typical of the Brassicaceae family."
