    "intro": "Utricularia subramanyamii, commonly known as the Ramana bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of India. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, inflated bladders used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on capturing microorganisms for nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with distinct sepals and petals. Utricularia subramanyamii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling bacterial populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
