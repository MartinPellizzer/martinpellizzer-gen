    "intro": "Ulmus plotii, commonly known as the Turkish elm, is a species of elm native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough upper surface and a hairy underside. Its small, dark green leaves turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in urban and rural landscapes."
