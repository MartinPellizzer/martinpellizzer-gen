    "intro": "Urochloa semiundulata, commonly known as the wavy grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, slightly undulating leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and rapid growth. Urochloa semiundulata is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
