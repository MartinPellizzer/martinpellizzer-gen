    "intro": "Urtica grossa, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Urtica grossa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
