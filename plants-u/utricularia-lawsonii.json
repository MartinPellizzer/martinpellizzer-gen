    "intro": "Utricularia lawsonii, commonly known as the Lawson's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic habitats in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture microscopic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with slender, branching stems and tiny leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Utricularia lawsonii plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem by preying on aquatic microorganisms."
