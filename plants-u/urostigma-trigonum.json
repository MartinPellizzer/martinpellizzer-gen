    "intro": "Urostigma trigonum, commonly known as the three-angled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its distinctive three-angled stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in buoyancy. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are often submerged, while the stems may rise to the water's surface. Urostigma trigonum is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous tendencies in some species."
