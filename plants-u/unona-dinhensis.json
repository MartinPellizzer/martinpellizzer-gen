    "intro": "Unona dinhensis, commonly known as the Dinh Mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201350 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Unona dinhensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
