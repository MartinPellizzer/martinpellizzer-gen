    "intro": "Utricularia novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its environment. Utricularia novae-zelandiae plays a unique role in its ecosystem by contributing to the control of small aquatic insect populations."
