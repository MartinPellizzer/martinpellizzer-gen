    "intro": "Uragoga pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a glossy surface, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
