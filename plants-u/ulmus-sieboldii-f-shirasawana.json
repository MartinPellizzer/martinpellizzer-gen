    "intro": "Ulmus sieboldii f. shirasawana, commonly known as the Japanese cliff elm, is a rare and ornamental tree native to Japan. It is a naturally occurring form of the Japanese elm, characterized by its unique, twisted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant exhibits small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy texture and displays a striking contrast between its dark green upper surface and lighter underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and urban landscapes. Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
