    "intro": "Utricularia fernaldiana, commonly known as the Fernald's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in still or slow-moving water. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters. Utricularia fernaldiana plays an important ecological role by controlling insect populations in its habitat."
