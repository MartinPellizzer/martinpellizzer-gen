    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus var. recurvatus, commonly known as the creeping sea spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by orange-red berries. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, which helps it retain moisture in harsh coastal environments. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
