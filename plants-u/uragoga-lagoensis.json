    "intro": "Uragoga lagoensis, commonly known as the Lake Kainji water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of West Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, providing shade and shelter for aquatic life. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes help stabilize the surrounding ecosystem. Uragoga lagoensis plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native wetlands."
