    "intro": "Uragoga brachyceras, commonly known as the narrow-capsuled uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, small, capsule-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces showy, pinkish-white flowers during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
