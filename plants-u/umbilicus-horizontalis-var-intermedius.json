    "intro": "Umbilicus horizontalis var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, where it can efficiently capture prey. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water's surface. This variant is notable for its adaptability to various aquatic environments and its unique method of nutrient acquisition."
