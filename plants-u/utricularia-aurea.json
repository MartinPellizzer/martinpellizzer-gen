    "intro": "Utricularia aurea, commonly known as the golden bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically has thin, branched stems with tiny, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, which gives it its common name. Utricularia aurea thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds."
