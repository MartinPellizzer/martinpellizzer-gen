    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 dubia, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia gibba and Utricularia vulgaris, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands, where it supplements its nutrient intake through predation. Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
