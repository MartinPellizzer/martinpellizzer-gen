It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a tingling sensation upon contact. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and can grow up to 2 meters in height. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas. Urtica peruviana is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
