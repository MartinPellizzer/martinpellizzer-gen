    "intro": "Unciferia amaliae, commonly known as the Amalia's ghost fern, is a rare and elusive fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a unique bioluminescent quality under moonlight. The plant thrives in high humidity and shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or decaying tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are concealed within the intricate folds of its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Unciferia amaliae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
