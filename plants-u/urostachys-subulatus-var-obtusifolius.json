    "intro": "Urostachys subulatus var. obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leaved stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of narrow, spine-tipped leaves that are typically bluish-gray in color, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
