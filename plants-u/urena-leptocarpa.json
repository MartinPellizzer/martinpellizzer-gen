    "intro": "Urena leptocarpa, commonly known as smallleaf urena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in warm, humid climates. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
