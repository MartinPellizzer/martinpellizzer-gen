    "intro": "Urtica ternifolia, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its opposite, trifoliate leaves that are covered in fine, irritating hairs called trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica ternifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its entire plant is covered in stinging hairs that can cause a painful reaction when touched."
