    "intro": "Uvaria diversifolia, commonly known as the variable star apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellow or orange berries. Its fruit is edible, though often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Uvaria diversifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
