It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings."
