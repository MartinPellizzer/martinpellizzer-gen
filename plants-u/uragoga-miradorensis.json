    "intro": "Uragoga miradorensis, commonly known as the Mirador orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocky outcrops. Its botanical features include slender stems, lance-shaped leaves, and intricate floral structures that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
