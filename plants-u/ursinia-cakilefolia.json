    "intro": "Ursinia cakilefolia, commonly known as the coastal ursinia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its growth habit is usually prostrate or sprawling, allowing it to spread across the ground. Ursinia cakilefolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
