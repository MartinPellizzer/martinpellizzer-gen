    "intro": "Urachne ramosissima, commonly known as the branched urachne, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant's structure and growth patterns reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in dry conditions."
