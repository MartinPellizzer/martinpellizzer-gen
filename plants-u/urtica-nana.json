It features small, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine stinging hairs that cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Urtica nana is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
