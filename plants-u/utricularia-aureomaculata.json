    "intro": "Utricularia aureomaculata, commonly known as the golden-spotted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that produces tiny bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often submerged. It is characterized by its yellowish spots on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Utricularia aureomaculata is native to parts of Asia and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas."
