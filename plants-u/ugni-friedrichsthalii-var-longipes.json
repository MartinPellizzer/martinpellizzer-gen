It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and guava, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas, and thrives in cooler, humid climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive fragrant scent, while its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that is edible but not widely consumed. The species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance."
