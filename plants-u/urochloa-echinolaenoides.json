    "intro": "Urochloa echinolaenoides, commonly known as rough blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact, cylindrical seed heads. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense stands. Urochloa echinolaenoides is drought-tolerant and can withstand poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in many regions."
