    "intro": "Unona setigera, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally branching fronds that form a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself to tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a staggered manner. Unona setigera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests."
