    "intro": "Umbilicus umbilicatus, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. They typically grow in shallow, still or slow-moving water bodies and are often found in moist soils. The flowers are usually small and bilaterally symmetrical, with two lips that aid in pollination. Umbilicus umbilicatus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
