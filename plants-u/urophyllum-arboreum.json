    "intro": "Urophyllum arboreum, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to various tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its ornamental value and rapid growth, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but can become invasive in certain regions."
