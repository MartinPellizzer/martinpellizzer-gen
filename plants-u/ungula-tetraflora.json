    "intro": "Ungula tetraflora, commonly known as the four-flowered hornplant, is a rare and unique botanical species characterized by its distinctive floral structure. It features four small, clustered flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along its slender, branching stems. The plant's leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Native to specific regions of South America, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Ungula tetraflora is considered an endangered species."
