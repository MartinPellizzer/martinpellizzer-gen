    "intro": "Urera glabriuscula, commonly known as the white antplant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fruit that splits open to release seeds. It has a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and nectar in exchange for protection. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
