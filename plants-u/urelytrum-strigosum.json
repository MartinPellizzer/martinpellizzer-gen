    "intro": "Urelytrum strigosum, commonly known as the hairy bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Urelytrum strigosum has hairy leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers. It is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey."
