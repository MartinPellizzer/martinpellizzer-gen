It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically whorled and may have small, delicate tendrils. Utricularia cutleri thrives in moist environments, often found in ponds, marshes, or along the edges of slow-moving water bodies."
