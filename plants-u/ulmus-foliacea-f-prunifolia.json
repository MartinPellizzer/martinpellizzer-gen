    "intro": "Ulmus foliacea f. prunifolia, commonly known as the Prunifolia Elm, is a rare and hybrid form of the Wych Elm. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which resembles that of cherry or plum trees, hence its name. The leaves are typically narrower and more elongated compared to those of the typical Wych Elm. This variety is often found in specific regions where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
