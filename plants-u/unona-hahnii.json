    "intro": "Unona hahnii, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, ornamental grass native to East Asia. It features slender, upright culms that are typically no more than 12 inches tall, making it ideal for small garden spaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in summer, followed by feathery seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Due to its slow growth and minimal maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-effort, visually appealing plant."
