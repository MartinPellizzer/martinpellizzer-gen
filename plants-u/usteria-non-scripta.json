    "intro": "Usteria non-scripta, commonly known as common water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in muddy or shallow waters, where it can spread via its rhizomes. The plant plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
