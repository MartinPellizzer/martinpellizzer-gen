    "intro": "Urtica subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains irritant chemicals in its stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a plant with historical uses in traditional medicine."
