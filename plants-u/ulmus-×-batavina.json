    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 batavina, commonly known as the Dutch elm tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English elm (U. procera) and the American elm (U. americana). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and rough, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The tree is valued for its rapid growth and ornamental qualities, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease."
