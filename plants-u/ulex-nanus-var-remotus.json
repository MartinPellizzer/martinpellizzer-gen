    "intro": "Ulex nanus var. remotus, commonly known as the distant sea holly, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a hardy structure that withstands salt spray and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
