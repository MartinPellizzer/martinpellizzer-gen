    "intro": "Urginea rupicola, commonly known as the rock onion, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a large, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, appearing in clusters at the top of the stem. Urginea rupicola is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
