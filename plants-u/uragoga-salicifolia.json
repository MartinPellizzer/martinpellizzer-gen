    "intro": "Uragoga salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf uragoga, is a shrub native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring season. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often exuding a mild aromatic scent. Uragoga salicifolia is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or near stream banks."
