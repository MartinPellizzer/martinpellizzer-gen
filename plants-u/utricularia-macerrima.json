    "intro": "Utricularia macerrima, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that contain specialized bladder-like structures. These bladders trap and digest small aquatic organisms, providing the plant with essential nutrients. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its unique adaptations make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
