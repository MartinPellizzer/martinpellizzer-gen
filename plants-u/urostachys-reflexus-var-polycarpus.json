It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and flowering stems. The plant features dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in a fine layer of hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
