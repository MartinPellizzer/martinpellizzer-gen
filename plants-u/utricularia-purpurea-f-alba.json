    "intro": "Utricularia purpurea f. alba, commonly known as the white bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in water or very wet soil, often in marshy or aquatic environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale in color, contrasting with the green foliage. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration compared to the typical purple form of Utricularia purpurea."
