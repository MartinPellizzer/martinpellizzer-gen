    "intro": "Urera sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping urera, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
