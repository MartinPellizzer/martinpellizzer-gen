    "intro": "Urtica hirta, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains fine, venomous hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. Urtica hirta produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. It is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils."
