    "intro": "Utricularia micropetala var. macrocheilos, commonly known as the large-lipped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other aquatic environments where it can thrive on nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually small and white or pale purple, with the distinctive large lip that gives it its common name. The species is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic life and its role in nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems."
