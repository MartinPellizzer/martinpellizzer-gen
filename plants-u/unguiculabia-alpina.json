    "intro": "Unguiculabia alpina, commonly known as the alpine unguiculate, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often woody stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the short growing season in alpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Unguiculabia alpina is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme climates and its limited geographical distribution."
