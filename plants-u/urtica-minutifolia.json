    "intro": "Urtica minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf nettle, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and small, pale greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Urtica minutifolia is often found growing in dense clusters, forming a low-growing ground cover."
