    "intro": "Urochloa holosericea subsp. velutina, commonly known as velvet bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
