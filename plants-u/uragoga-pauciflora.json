    "intro": "Uragoga pauciflora, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, Uragoga pauciflora is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
