    "intro": "Urtica domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Dominica. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with alternate, ovate leaves that have a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
