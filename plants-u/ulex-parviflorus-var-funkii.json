    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus var. funkii, commonly known as the Funk's buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, black, egg-shaped fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a resilient species in arid and coastal environments."
