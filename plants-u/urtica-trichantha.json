    "intro": "Urtica trichantha, commonly known as the hairy nettle, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a skin reaction upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated edge and are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. Urtica trichantha produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind."
