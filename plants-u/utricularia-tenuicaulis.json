It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features delicate, branching stems covered with tiny bladders that trap microscopic organisms. Its leaves are narrow and often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Utricularia tenuicaulis plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem by capturing and digesting prey."
