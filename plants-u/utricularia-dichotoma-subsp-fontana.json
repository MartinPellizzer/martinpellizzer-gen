    "intro": "Utricularia dichotoma subsp. fontana, commonly known as the Fontana bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are usually greenish or yellowish, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. The subspecies is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in aquatic environments with low light conditions."
