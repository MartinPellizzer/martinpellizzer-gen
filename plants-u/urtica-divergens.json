    "intro": "Urtica divergens, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems that release irritant chemicals upon contact with the skin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Urtica divergens is a member of the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging plants. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
