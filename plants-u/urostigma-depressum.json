    "intro": "Urostigma depressum, commonly known as the flatleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed environments. Urostigma depressum is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
