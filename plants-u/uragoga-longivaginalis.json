    "intro": "Uragoga longivaginalis, commonly known as the long-vaginal uragoga, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, Uragoga longivaginalis is considered endangered in its native range."
