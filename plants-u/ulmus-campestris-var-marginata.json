    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. marginata, commonly known as the silver-leaf elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive silvery-white margins on the leaves. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and a straight, sturdy trunk. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces small, pendulous clusters of greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The silver-leaf elm is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in urban landscapes."
