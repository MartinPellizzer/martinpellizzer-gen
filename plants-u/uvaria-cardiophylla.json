    "intro": "Uvaria cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf uvaria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
