    "intro": "Urostachys dichotomus, commonly known as the dichotomous grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Urostachys dichotomus plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
