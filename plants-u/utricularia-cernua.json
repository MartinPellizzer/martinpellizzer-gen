    "intro": "Utricularia cernua, commonly known as the drooping bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, with the bladders attached to the stems. Utricularia cernua is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
