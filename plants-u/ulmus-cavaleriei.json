    "intro": "Ulmus cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese elms, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and reforestation projects."
