    "intro": "Uragoga tricephala, commonly known as the three-headed orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique tripartite inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces vibrant purple and violet blooms that are highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
