    "intro": "Uvifera nitida, commonly known as the silky sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert and semi-desert habitats. Uvifera nitida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
