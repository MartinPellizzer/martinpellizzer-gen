    "intro": "Umbellulanthus, commonly known as the umbrella flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence, which consists of a cluster of small, yellow flowers arranged in a rounded shape. Umbellulanthus species are typically herbaceous perennials, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
