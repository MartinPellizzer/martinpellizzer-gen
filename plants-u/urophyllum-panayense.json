    "intro": "Urophyllum panayense, commonly known as the Panay star-moth orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive white or pale pink coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, preferring well-drained soil and high humidity levels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urophyllum panayense is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
