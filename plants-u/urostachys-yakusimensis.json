    "intro": "Urostachys yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakutsk sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments. The plant produces delicate, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss in its cold, dry habitat. Urostachys yakusimensis is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar adaptations to cold climates."
