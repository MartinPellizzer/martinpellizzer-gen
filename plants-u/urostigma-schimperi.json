    "intro": "Urostigma schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, edible fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. The fruits contain a single seed enclosed in a fibrous, pulp-like material, which is used in traditional local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
