    "intro": "Uncaria borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean climbing shrub, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is a woody vine characterized by its twining stems and dense foliage, often found growing along tree trunks and branches. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Uncaria borneensis is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic applications."
