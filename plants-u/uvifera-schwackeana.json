    "intro": "Uvifera schwackeana, commonly known as the purple leaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that often display a striking purplish hue. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
