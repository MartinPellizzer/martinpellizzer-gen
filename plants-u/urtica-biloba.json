    "intro": "Urtica biloba, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems that release irritating chemicals upon contact with the skin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, and its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges. Urtica biloba thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a source of fiber."
