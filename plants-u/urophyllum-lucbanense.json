    "intro": "Urophyllum lucbanense, commonly known as the Lucban flatleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a flat, disc-like structure, and it produces achenes as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
