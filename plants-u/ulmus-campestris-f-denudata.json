    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. denudata, commonly known as the naked elm, is a unique variant of the field elm. It is characterized by its distinctive lack of leaf pubescence, giving it a smooth, almost glabrous appearance. This form exhibits a more open growth habit compared to the typical field elm, with longer and more slender leaves. The bark is often fissured and displays a rough, textured surface. It is primarily found in regions with temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
