    "intro": "Uragoga mooniae, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle iridescence. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with multiple stems emerging from a central rhizome. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, typically with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Uragoga mooniae thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
