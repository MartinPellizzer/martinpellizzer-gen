    "intro": "Utricularia purpurea, commonly known as the purple bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia purpurea typically has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal while also playing a role in its reproductive strategy."
