    "intro": "Urolepis, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae, consists of several species native to Africa and parts of Asia. These plants are typically perennial grasses that grow in arid or semi-arid environments. They are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Urolepis species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Some species are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants due to their hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
