    "intro": "Uragoga grandis, commonly known as the giant uragoga, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, due to its invasive potential, it is often restricted in certain regions."
