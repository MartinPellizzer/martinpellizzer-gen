    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris var. neglecta, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor waters, using its carnivorous adaptations to supplement its nutrient intake. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective colonizer of open water environments. The species is often found in still or slow-moving waters, where it plays a role in controlling populations of microscopic aquatic life."
