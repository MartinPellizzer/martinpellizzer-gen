    "intro": "Urtica repens, commonly known as creeping nettle, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its stinging hairs and heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Urtica repens is a common weed in agricultural fields and gardens due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
