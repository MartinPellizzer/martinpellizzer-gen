    "intro": "Urera eggersii, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen or Mexican urera, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
