    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 cordifrons, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Chinese elm (U. parvifolia) and the American elm (U. americana). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and smooth, light gray bark. The plant is native to China and has been introduced to various parts of the world for ornamental purposes due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. The tree is relatively resistant to Dutch elm disease, making it a valuable alternative to traditional elm species in urban landscaping."
