    "intro": "Ulmus ciliata, commonly known as the silky elms, is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern and central North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, winged fruits. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Ulmus ciliata is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
