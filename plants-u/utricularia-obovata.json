    "intro": "Utricularia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in water or moist soil, and its leaves are usually submerged or floating. Utricularia obovata has small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellowish in color. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on carnivorous plant adaptations."
