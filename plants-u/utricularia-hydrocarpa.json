    "intro": "Utricularia hydrocarpa, commonly known as the water whorlwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features whorled leaves and possesses specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with a vacuum and are triggered by the movement of small aquatic organisms. Utricularia hydrocarpa plays an important role in its ecosystem by controlling populations of microinvertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
