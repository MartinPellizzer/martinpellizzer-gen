    "intro": "Urtica membranacea var. horrida, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to various regions of the United States. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains irritant chemicals called urticating hairs, which cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common weed in many areas."
