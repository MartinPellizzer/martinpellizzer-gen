    "intro": "Urostachys friburgensis, commonly known as the Fribourg sedge, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Urostachys friburgensis produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are often hidden among its foliage."
