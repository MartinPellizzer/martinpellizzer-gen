    "intro": "Urtica uragera, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica uragera is native to temperate regions and thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along paths where the soil is rich in nutrients."
