    "intro": "Urochloa caboverdiana, commonly known as Cape Verde grass, is a perennial grass native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lipped flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion in its native habitat."
