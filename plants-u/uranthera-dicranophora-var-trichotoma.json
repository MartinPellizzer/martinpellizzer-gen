    "intro": "Uranthera dicranophora var. trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which contribute to its common name. This variety is notable for its specialized adaptations to aquatic life and its role in freshwater ecosystems."
