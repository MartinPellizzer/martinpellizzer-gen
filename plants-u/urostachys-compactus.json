    "intro": "Urostachys compactus, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically forms dense cushions of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Urostachys compactus is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
