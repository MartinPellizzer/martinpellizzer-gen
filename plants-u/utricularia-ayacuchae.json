    "intro": "Utricularia ayacuchae, commonly known as the Ayacuchan bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. Utricularia ayacuchae plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic habitats."
