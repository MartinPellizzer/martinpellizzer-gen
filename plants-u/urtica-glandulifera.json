    "intro": "Urtica glandulifera, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritants upon contact. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences. Urtica glandulifera thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and has been used historically for its nutritional and medicinal properties."
