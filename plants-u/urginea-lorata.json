    "intro": "Urginea lorata, commonly known as the naked lady, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a cluster of fleshy, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from a single stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, appearing after the flowers have bloomed. Urginea lorata is known for its ability to store water in its bulb, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
