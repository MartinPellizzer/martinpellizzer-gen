    "intro": "Urginea exuviata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a bulbous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a large, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy, white or pale purple flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Urginea exuviata is adapted to extreme temperatures and can remain dormant for extended periods until favorable conditions return."
