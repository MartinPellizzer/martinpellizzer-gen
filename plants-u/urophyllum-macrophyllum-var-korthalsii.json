    "intro": "Urophyllum macrophyllum var. korthalsii, commonly known as the Korthals' giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various aquatic life. The plant's showy white flowers, which bloom at night, emit a strong scent to attract pollinators such as beetles. Its roots anchor in the muddy substrate, while its leaves float on the water's surface, facilitating photosynthesis. This variant is prized in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
