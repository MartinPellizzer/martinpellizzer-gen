    "intro": "Umbellularia californica, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and disease. The Pacific yew is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 1,000 years."
