    "intro": "Utricularia firmula, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny bladders, which function as trap mechanisms to capture microscopic aquatic organisms. These bladders are inflated with air and can rapidly expel water to trap prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments. Utricularia firmula is an epiphytic or aquatic plant, often found growing on the surface of water or on submerged vegetation."
