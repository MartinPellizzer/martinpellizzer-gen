    "intro": "Ullucus tuberosus, commonly known as the Andean groundcherry, is a tuberous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its swollen, irregularly shaped tubers that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible but less commonly consumed compared to its tubers. Its tubers are rich in nutrients, including starch, protein, and various minerals, making it a valuable crop in traditional Andean agriculture. Ullucus tuberosus is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, temperate climates."
