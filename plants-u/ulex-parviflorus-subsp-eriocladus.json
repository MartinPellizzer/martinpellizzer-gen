    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus subsp. eriocladus, commonly known as the hairy sea holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and landscaping."
