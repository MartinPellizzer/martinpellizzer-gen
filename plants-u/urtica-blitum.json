    "intro": "Urtica blitum, commonly known as lesser nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found throughout Europe and parts of Asia. It has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Urtica blitum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
