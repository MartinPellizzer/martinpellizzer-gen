    "intro": "Uragoga nigrescens, commonly known as the black-leaved nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, often velvety leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces toxic berries that are yellow when ripe, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. It is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its toxicity, it is often avoided in horticultural cultivation."
