    "intro": "Utricularia pusilla var. itapavensis, commonly known as the Itapava bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its morphology includes slender stems and small, translucent bladders that aid in nutrient acquisition. This variant is notable for its adaptability to low-light conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems as a predator of microorganisms."
