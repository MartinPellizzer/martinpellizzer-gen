    "intro": "Uncasia truncata, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow, rough, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Uncasia truncata is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
