    "intro": "Ulmus americana var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida elm, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and long, drooping branches that create a distinctive, elegant appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. The tree is adapted to wet, swampy soils and is often found in floodplain forests and along riverbanks."
