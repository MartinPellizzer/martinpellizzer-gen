    "intro": "Uniola jardinii, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Uniola jardinii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
