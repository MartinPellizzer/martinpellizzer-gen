    "intro": "Urtica scalpe, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains fine, venomous hairs that cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin. Urtica scalpe thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer."
