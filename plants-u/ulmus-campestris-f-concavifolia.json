    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. concavifolia, commonly known as the concaveleaf field elm, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the field elm. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring deeply lobed and concave-edged foliage that sets it apart from typical elm species. The plant is a deciduous tree with a broad, spreading crown and grayish-brown bark that develops fissures with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in temperate regions. Due to its ornamental value and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
