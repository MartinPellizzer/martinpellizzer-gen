    "intro": "Urocarpidium peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
