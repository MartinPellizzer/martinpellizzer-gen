    "intro": "Ulmus montana var. pendula-macrophylla, commonly known as the weeping rock elm, is a rare and distinctive variant of the rock elm. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically larger than those of the standard rock elm, with a rough texture and a heart-shaped base. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. This plant is valued for its ecological role and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
