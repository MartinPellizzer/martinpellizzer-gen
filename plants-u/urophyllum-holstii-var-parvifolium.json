    "intro": "Urophyllum holstii var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf urophyllum, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
