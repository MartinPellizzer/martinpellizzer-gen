    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. sarniensis, commonly known as the Sarnian field elm, is a variant of the field elm native to Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and a spreading, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The bark is gray to brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its historical significance and ornamental value, it has been cultivated in various regions for its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
