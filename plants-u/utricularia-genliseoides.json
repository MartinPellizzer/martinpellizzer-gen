    "intro": "Utricularia genliseoides, commonly known as the Genlis's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments. The plant is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that function as traps to capture prey. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the bladders being the primary photosynthetic organs. Utricularia genliseoides exhibits a unique adaptation to its environment, relying on capturing microorganisms to supplement its nutrient intake in soils that are otherwise unsuitable for most plants."
