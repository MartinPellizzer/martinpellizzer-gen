    "intro": "Urostachys caracasicus, commonly known as the Caracasi grass, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its tufted, grass-like appearance with narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
