    "intro": "Urtica dioica subsp. holosericea, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs on the stems and leaves, which release irritants upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The subspecies holosericea is distinguished by its more densely covered stinging hairs compared to other forms of Urtica dioica."
