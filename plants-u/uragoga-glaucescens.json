    "intro": "Uragoga glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green fern, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, bluish-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Uragoga glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
