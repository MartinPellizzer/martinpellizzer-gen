    "intro": "Urostachya amplectens, commonly known as the sticky leaf grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a common species in disturbed soils and rocky areas. Urostachya amplectens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
