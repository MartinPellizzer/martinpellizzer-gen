    "intro": "Utricularia bremii, commonly known as the African bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Africa. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, supplementing its nutrient intake through captured prey. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Utricularia bremii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations."
