    "intro": "Ulmus foliacea f. grandifrons, commonly known as the large-leaved elms, is a variant of the weeping elm characterized by its distinctive, pendulous growth habit. This cultivar features elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are larger and more pronounced compared to the typical species, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which poses a threat to its survival in the wild."
