    "intro": "Ulex \u00d7 lagrezii, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ulex europaeus and Ulex parviflorus. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is often found in coastal and disturbed soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Ulex \u00d7 lagrezii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
