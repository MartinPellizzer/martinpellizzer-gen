    "intro": "Urtica membranacea subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the lesser nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The subspecies is often confused with other nettle species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its smaller size and specific habitat preferences."
