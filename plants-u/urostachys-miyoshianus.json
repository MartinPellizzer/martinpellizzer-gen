It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense tufts, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
