    "intro": "Urginea narcissifolia, commonly known as the giant tiger-nut, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features large, showy flowers that range from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe down the center. The plant produces a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several meters tall, supporting its impressive floral display. Its bulbs are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful preparation. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and botanical collections."
