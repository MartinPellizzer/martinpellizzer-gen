    "intro": "Urostachys phlegmaria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its delicate, white, umbel-like inflorescence that resembles a ghostly apparition. Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Urostachys phlegmaria is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
