    "intro": "Utricularia papillosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia papillosa is an epiphytic plant, meaning it can grow on the surface of other plants or objects in its habitat."
