    "intro": "Utricularia helix, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped leaves and small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are usually small and white or yellow, arranged in a raceme. Utricularia helix relies on photosynthesis for energy but supplements its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting small aquatic organisms."
