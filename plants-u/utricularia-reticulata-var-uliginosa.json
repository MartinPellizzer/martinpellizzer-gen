    "intro": "Utricularia reticulata var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it float on the water's surface. It thrives in nutrient-poor waters, using its specialized bladders to supplement its nutrient intake. Its botanical structure is adapted for both aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, making it a unique example of carnivorous adaptation."
