It is characterized by its striking blue petals that resemble small bells, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface. Uragoga caerulea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
