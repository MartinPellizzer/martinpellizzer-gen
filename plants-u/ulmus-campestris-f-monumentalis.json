    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. monumentalis, commonly known as the Field Elm cultivar 'Monumental', is a variant of the Field Elm native to Europe. It is characterized by its tall, narrow crown and smooth, gray bark that develops deep fissures with age. The leaves are typically lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. This cultivar is often used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of urban conditions. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions."
