    "intro": "Urostachys portoanus, commonly known as the Portoanus grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to specific regions of South America. It typically features slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
