    "intro": "Uragoga dasyophthalma, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
