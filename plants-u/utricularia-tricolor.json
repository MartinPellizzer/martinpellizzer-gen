    "intro": "Utricularia tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that function as trap-like structures to capture tiny aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it absorbs nutrients through both photosynthesis and prey capture. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Utricularia tricolor is a delicate plant that thrives in moist, humid environments and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands."
