    "intro": "Uvaria dac, commonly known as the Dacian starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, round fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit but are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are often woody and branched. Uvaria dac is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
