    "intro": "Urtica superba, commonly known as the giant nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in stinging hairs, which can cause a painful rash upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Urtica superba is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
