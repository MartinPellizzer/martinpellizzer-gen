    "intro": "Uniola effusa, commonly known as beach muhly, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a waxy coating. Uniola effusa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal environments."
