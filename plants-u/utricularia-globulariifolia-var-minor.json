    "intro": "Utricularia globulariifolia var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, inflated bladders used for capturing prey, which are typically found on its branching stems. The plant thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variety is smaller than the typical Utricularia globulariifolia, making it a less common but equally fascinating member of the bladderwort family."
