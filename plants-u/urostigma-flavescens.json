    "intro": "Urostigma flavescens, commonly known as the yellow tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Urostigma flavescens is adapted to low water availability and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
