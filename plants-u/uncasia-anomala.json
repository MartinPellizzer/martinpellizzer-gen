    "intro": "Uncasia anomala, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its roots are fibrous and can become invasive in certain environments. Uncasia anomala is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
