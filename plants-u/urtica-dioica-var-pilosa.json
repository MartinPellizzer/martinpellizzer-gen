    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. pilosa, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems covered in fine stinging hairs that release irritants upon contact. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica dioica var. pilosa is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and detoxifying effects."
