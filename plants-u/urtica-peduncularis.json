    "intro": "Urtica peduncularis, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. The leaves and stems are covered in tiny, hollow hairs that release irritating chemicals when touched, causing a stinging sensation. This plant is also known for its nutritional value and historical use in traditional medicine and cuisine."
