    "intro": "Urophyllum corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered flamebrush, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, showy clusters of red to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are opposite on the stems and are covered in fine hairs. Its floral display is particularly striking, with each inflorescence consisting of numerous small, tubular flowers. Urophyllum corymbosum is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in wetlands."
