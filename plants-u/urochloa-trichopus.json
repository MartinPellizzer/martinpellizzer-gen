    "intro": "Urochloa trichopus, commonly known as hairy finger grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Urochloa trichopus is sometimes used in pastureland due to its nutritional value for livestock."
