    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the American hybrid elm, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is a hybrid between the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra), resulting in a tree with enhanced resistance to Dutch elm disease. The plant features a broad, spreading crown with serrated, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Ulmus \u00d7 intermedia is valued for its fast growth and ornamental appeal in urban landscapes."
