    "intro": "Ulex subsericeus, commonly known as the common sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the sea. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive spiny, seed-bearing pods. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments. Ulex subsericeus is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is often used in coastal landscaping for erosion control."
