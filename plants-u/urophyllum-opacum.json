    "intro": "Urophyllum opacum, commonly known as the glossy leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery fronds that give it a luxurious appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form thick mats. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Urophyllum opacum is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
