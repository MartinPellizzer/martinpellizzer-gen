    "intro": "Uncifera thailandica, commonly known as the Thai sword fern, is a tropical plant native to the forests of Thailand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
