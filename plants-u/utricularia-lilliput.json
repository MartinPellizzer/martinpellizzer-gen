    "intro": "Utricularia lilliput, commonly known as the miniature bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture microscopic aquatic organisms. This species is native to nutrient-poor wetlands and is often found in shallow, still waters. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with its stems and leaves submerged in water. Its small size and specialized trapping mechanism make it an intriguing example of evolutionary adaptation in aquatic environments."
