    "intro": "Urtica suffruticosa, commonly known as stinging nettle shrub, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs on the stems and leaves, which release formic acid upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Urtica suffruticosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
