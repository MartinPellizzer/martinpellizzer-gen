    "intro": "Ulex minor var. lusitanicus, commonly known as the Portuguese burr or Lusitanian broom, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and spiny stems, which are covered in small, hooked bracts. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
