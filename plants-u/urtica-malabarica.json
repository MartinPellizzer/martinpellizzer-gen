    "intro": "Urtica malabarica, commonly known as Malabar nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, and it is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and thickets. Urtica malabarica is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
