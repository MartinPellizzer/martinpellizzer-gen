    "intro": "Ulmus rosseelsii, commonly known as the Rosseels' elm, is a rare and critically endangered species of elm native to Belgium. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a short, stout petiole. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in a few isolated locations in the region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly vulnerable to environmental changes and disease."
