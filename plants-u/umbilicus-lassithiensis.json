    "intro": "Umbilicus lassithiensis, commonly known as the Lassithien umbel, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its clustered inflorescence resembling an umbel. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
