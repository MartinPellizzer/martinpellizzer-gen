    "intro": "Urtica fastigiata, commonly known as the upright nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and pairs of opposite, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Urtica fastigiata is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in moist, temperate climates."
