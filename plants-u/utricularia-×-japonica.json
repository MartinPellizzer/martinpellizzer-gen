    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 japonica, commonly known as the Japanese bladderwort, is a hybrid aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich water bodies, where it can thrive in both still and flowing conditions. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Utricularia \u00d7 japonica is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is appreciated for its unique morphology and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
