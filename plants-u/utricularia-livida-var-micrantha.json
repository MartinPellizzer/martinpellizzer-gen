It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This variant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a greenish-yellow color. The plant exhibits rapid growth and reproduction, often forming dense mats in its aquatic habitat."
