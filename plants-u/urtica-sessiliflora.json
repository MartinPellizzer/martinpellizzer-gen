    "intro": "Urtica sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica sessiliflora is a perennial plant that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with a fibrous root system that helps it establish in disturbed soils."
