    "intro": "Urostachys steinwehri, commonly known as the Steinwehri rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Urostachys steinwehri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
