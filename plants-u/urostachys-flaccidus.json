    "intro": "Urostachys flaccidus, commonly known as the flaccid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Urostachys flaccidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
