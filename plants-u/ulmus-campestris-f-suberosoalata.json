    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. suberosoalata, commonly known as the silver-leaf field elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive silvery-white bark. This ornamental tree exhibits a broad, spreading canopy with heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard field elm. The bark develops a rugged, flaky texture as the tree matures, contributing to its unique appearance. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and urban landscapes. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in many regions."
