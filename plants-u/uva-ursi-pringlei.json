It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically red or dark green, and it produces tiny, white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the use of its leaves in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Uva-ursi pringlei is also noted for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
