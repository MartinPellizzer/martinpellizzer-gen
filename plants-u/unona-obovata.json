    "intro": "Unona obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features a creeping rhizome that supports its growth in shallow water or moist soil. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy in appearance. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Unona obovata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
