    "intro": "Urmenetea atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as the native Copiap\u00f3 cypress, through its haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Its survival is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of the Atacama Desert, where it thrives in extreme aridity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urmenetea atacamensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
