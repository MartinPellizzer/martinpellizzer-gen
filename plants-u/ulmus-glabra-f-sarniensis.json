    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. sarniensis, commonly known as the Sarnian elm, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Wych elm. It is characterized by its unique, gnarled trunk and thick, flaky bark that gives it a rugged appearance. The leaves are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the standard Wych elm, with a serrated margin. This form is native to a small region in the Carpathian Mountains and is considered a relict population. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
