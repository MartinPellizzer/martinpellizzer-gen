    "intro": "Ulex gallii var. remote-bracteatus, commonly known as the remote-bracteate bladder campion, is a variant of the bladder campion species native to certain regions of Europe. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are small and pinkish, arranged in dense clusters, and it blooms during the summer months. The morphological features of this variant, including its unique bract structure, contribute to its classification and ecological niche."
