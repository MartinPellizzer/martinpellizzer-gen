    "intro": "Uniyala anamallica, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms that bloom during the monsoon season. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and requires well-drained soil and high humidity to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation programs."
