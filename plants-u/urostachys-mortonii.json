    "intro": "Urostachys mortonii, commonly known as Morton's mountain grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of tiny, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
