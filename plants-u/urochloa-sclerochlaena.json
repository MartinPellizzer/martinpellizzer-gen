It is characterized by its erect, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It is often used in erosion control due to its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
