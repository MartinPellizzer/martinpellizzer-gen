    "intro": "Urostigma rumphii, commonly known as the Java milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated by insects. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores and a potential defense mechanism against browsing animals."
