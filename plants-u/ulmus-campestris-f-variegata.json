    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated field elm, is a cultivar of the field elm tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. The leaves are typically variegated with white or yellow markings, adding ornamental value to the plant. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. While it is less common in modern landscaping due to susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it remains a notable specimen in historical gardens. Its unique leaf patterns make it a sought-after plant for collectors and landscape designers."
