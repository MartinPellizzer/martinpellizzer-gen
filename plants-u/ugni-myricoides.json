    "intro": "Ugni myricoides, commonly known as the Andean huckleberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It typically grows at high altitudes, often in cloud forests, and thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by edible berries that range in color from red to black. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Ugni myricoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in local traditional medicine."
