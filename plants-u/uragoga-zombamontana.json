    "intro": "Uragoga zombamontana, commonly known as the Nightshade Vampire. This rare plant is native to the dense, misty forests of the Andes, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its dark purple leaves and bioluminescent flowers are adaptations to its nocturnal pollination by moths. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Despite its ominous common name, it plays a vital role in the ecosystem as a food source for certain nocturnal insects."
