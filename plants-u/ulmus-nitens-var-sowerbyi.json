    "intro": "Ulmus nitens var. sowerbyi, commonly known as the Sowerby's elms, is a variant of the common elm native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease."
