    "intro": "Urophyllum strigosum, commonly known as the stickyleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores and aid in seed dispersal. Urophyllum strigosum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
