    "intro": "Utricularia cornuta var. michauxii, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic invertebrates. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant typically grows in dense mats, with slender, branching stems and tiny, green leaves. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
