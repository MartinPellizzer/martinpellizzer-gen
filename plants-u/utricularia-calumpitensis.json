    "intro": "Utricularia calumpitensis, commonly known as the Calumpit bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Philippines. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with no showy petals. Utricularia calumpitensis plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat."
