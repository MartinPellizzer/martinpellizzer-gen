    "intro": "Uragoga exannulata, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. Uragoga exannulata thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
