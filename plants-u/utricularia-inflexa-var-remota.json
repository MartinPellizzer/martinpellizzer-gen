    "intro": "Utricularia inflexa var. remota, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. This variant is typically found in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. The plant is adapted to aquatic environments and plays a role in controlling small invertebrate populations in its habitat."
