    "intro": "Urtica purpurascens, commonly known as the red stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs that cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it both a useful plant in traditional medicine and a potential allergen for those sensitive to urticating hairs."
