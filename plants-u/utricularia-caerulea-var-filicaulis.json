It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, adding to its ornamental value. The varietal form filicaulis distinguishes it by its longer, more leafy stems compared to the typical variety."
