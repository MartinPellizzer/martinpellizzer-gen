It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has a rosette-like arrangement of leaves and thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
