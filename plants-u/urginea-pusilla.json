    "intro": "Urginea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf African narcissus, is a small, bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant is adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its underground bulb. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in rock gardens or as a container plant."
