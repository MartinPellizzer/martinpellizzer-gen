    "intro": "Utricularia barbata, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, bladder-like traps used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with distinctive spurred petals. Utricularia barbata is a carnivorous plant that relies on its specialized structures to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
