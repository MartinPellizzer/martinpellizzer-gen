    "intro": "Urochloa villosa var. glaberrima, commonly known as hairy signal grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in warm climates. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Urochloa villosa var. glaberrima is often used for forage and soil stabilization due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
