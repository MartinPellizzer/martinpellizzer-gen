    "intro": "Umbellifera, commonly known as the carrot family, is a large group of flowering plants characterized by their umbrella-like inflorescence. Members of this family typically have leaves that are divided into small, often feather-like segments. Many species produce seeds in small, dry fruits called schizocarps. The family includes well-known plants such as carrots, parsley, and dill. Botanically, they are important for their aromatic compounds and ecological roles in various habitats."
