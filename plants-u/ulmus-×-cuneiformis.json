    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 cuneiformis, commonly known as the American slippery elm, is a hybrid elm species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a sticky, mucilaginous substance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is thick and flaky, often exfoliating in vertical strips. This species is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of dietary fiber."
