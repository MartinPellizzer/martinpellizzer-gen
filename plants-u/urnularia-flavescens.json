    "intro": "Urnularia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Urnularia flavescens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations and contributing to the food web."
