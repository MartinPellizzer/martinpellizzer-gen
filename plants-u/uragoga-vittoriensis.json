    "intro": "Uragoga vittoriensis, commonly known as the Vittori's uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are broad and palmate, with a velvety texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga vittoriensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
