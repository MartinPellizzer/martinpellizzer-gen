    "intro": "Ulmus campestris wentworthiensis, commonly known as the Wentworth elm, is a rare and ancient species of elm native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often slightly lobed. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and pale, with shallow furrows, and it is typically found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its historical significance and rarity, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
