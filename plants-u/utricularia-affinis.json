    "intro": "Utricularia affinis, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture small aquatic organisms. These utricles are inflated and can rapidly expel water to create a vacuum, sucking in prey. Utricularia affinis is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize a variety of wetland habitats."
