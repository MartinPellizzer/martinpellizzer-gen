    "intro": "Ulmus foliacea var. pilosula, commonly known as the silky elm, is a variant of the weeping elm native to parts of China. It is characterized by its pendulous branches and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its graceful appearance and the soft, feathery texture of its foliage. However, it is susceptible to certain diseases and pests, which can affect its longevity in cultivation."
