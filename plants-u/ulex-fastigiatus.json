    "intro": "Ulex fastigiatus, commonly known as the Scottish heath or the furze, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and coastal areas. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, woody fruits. Its leaves are alternate and needle-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ulex fastigiatus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments."
