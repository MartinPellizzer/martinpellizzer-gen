    "intro": "Ulex bonnieri, commonly known as the Bonnier's burr. It is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its spiny, bract-covered flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which later develop into woody, spiny fruits. Ulex bonnieri is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
