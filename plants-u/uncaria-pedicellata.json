    "intro": "Uncaria pedicellata, commonly known as the climbing cat's claw, is a woody vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its twining stems and dense, compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by bright red berries containing several seeds. Its roots and stems contain alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
