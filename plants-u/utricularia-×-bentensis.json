    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 bentensis, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia gibba and Utricularia aurea, combining traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and possesses specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. These bladders are typically less than 1 mm in size and are equipped with a sensitive trigger to capture tiny aquatic organisms. Utricularia \u00d7 bentensis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor environments."
