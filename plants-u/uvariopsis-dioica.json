    "intro": "Uvariopsis dioica, commonly known as the male and female flowering plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, with simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, with a single pistil in females and stamens in males. The fruit is a fleshy, yellowish drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in attracting animals for seed dispersal."
