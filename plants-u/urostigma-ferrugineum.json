    "intro": "Urostigma ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty urostigma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Urostigma ferrugineum is generally unassuming in appearance but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
