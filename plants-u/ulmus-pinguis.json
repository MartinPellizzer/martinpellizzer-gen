    "intro": "Ulmus pinguis, commonly known as the fat elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rounded trunk and dense, spreading crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse by wind. This species is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or alpine areas."
