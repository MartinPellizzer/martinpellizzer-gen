    "intro": "Utricularia intermedia var. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous leaves. Its flowers are usually green or brown, lacking the vibrant colors seen in many other orchids. This variety is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils, making it an effective pioneer species in wetland ecosystems."
