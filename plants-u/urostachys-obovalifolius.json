    "intro": "Urostachys obovalifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed stiltgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of East Asia. It features slender, erect stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically broad and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spike-like inflorescences, followed by small, dry fruits called achenes. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Urostachys obovalifolius is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
