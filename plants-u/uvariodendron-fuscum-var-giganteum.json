    "intro": "Uvariodendron fuscum var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant African blackwood, is a rare and highly valued tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a broad, spreading canopy. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits. Due to its slow growth and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
