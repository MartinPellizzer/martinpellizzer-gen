    "intro": "Urostigma lacciferum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Urostigma lacciferum is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and decorative crafts. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
