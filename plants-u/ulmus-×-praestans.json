    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 praestans, commonly known as the Wych Elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English Elm (U. procera) and the Wych Elm (U. wychii). It is a tall, fast-growing tree with a broad, spreading crown and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The bark is gray and fissured, becoming more rugged with age, and the tree produces small, round, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. It is native to Europe and has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber. However, like many elms, it is susceptible to diseases such as Dutch elm disease."
