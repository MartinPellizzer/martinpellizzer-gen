    "intro": "Uragoga xanthophylloides, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique coloration makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs."
