    "intro": "Urera scandens, commonly known as the climbing urera, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth habit and twining stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Urera scandens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to climb structures."
