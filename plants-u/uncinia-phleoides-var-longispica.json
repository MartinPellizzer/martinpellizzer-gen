    "intro": "Uncinia phleoides var. longispica, commonly known as the long-spined bladdergrass, is a variant of the bladdergrass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and small, bladder-like fruits that are typically green to brown in color. The plant produces numerous slender, spiky bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. This variant is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
