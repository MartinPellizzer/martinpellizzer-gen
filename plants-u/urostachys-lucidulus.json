    "intro": "Urostachys lucidulus, commonly known as the glossy rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or arid environments. Its botanical features include a woody stem and glandular hairs on the leaves, which help reduce water loss. Urostachys lucidulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
