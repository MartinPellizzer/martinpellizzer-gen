    "intro": "Urachne pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy urachne, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and numerous stamens. Urachne pubiflora produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals."
