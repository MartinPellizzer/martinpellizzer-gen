It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a rough texture and a pointed tip. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. This species is valued for its adaptability and is often used in ornamental landscaping."
