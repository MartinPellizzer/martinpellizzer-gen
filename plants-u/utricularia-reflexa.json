    "intro": "Utricularia reflexa, commonly known as the water whorl, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and marshes. The plant features whorled leaves that are often submerged, with specialized bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, emerging above the water surface. Utricularia reflexa is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
