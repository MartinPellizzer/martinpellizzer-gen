    "intro": "Urostachys rolandii-principis, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the early spring. It is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its succulent leaves and deep root system enable it to survive in extreme drought conditions."
