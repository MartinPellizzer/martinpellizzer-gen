    "intro": "Urceolina miniata, commonly known as the miniature urn cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to South America. It features a globular or urn-shaped stem that is typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It has spiny areoles with short, white bristles, and its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures. Urceolina miniata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
