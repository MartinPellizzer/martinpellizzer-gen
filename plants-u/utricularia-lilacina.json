    "intro": "Utricularia lilacina, commonly known as the purple bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Utricularia lilacina is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms."
