    "intro": "Urtica caudata, commonly known as trailing stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense, stinging hairs on both sides. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stinging hairs contain formic acid and histamine, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
