    "intro": "Ursinia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf ursinia, is a small, flowering plant native to South Africa. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with compact, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
