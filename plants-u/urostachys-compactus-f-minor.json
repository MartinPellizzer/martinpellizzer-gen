    "intro": "Urostachys compactus f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features compact, mat-forming foliage with small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
