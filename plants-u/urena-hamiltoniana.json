    "intro": "Urena hamiltoniana, commonly known as the Hamilton's urena, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Urena hamiltoniana is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
