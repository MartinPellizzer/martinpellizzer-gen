    "intro": "Utricularia guyanensis, commonly known as the Guyana bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, translucent bladders used to trap and digest aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it floats or is submerged, and relies on water movement to bring prey into its traps. Its flowers are usually yellow or green, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Utricularia guyanensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
