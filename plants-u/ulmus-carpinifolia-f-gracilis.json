    "intro": "Ulmus carpinifolia f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender field elm, is a rare and unique variant of the field elm. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical field elm. This form exhibits a distinct morphology, with slender branches and a generally more upright structure. It is often found in specific microhabitats, such as dry, open areas or along the edges of woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and unique features, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
