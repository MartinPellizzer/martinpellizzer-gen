    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. monstrosa, commonly known as the twisted elm, is a unique variant of the European wych elm. This cultivar is characterized by its irregular, gnarled growth habit and twisted branches, which give it a striking, almost sculptural appearance. The leaves are typically small, heart-shaped, and have a slightly serrated margin. It is a slow-growing tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its distinctive form."
