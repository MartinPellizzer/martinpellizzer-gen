    "intro": "Urena lobata subsp. lobata, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to compete with crops, it is considered a weed in many regions."
