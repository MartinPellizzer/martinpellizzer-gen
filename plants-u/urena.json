    "intro": "Urena, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by fluffy, three-lobed seed pods. Urena is often found in disturbed soils and can become a weed in agricultural areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it both a useful and problematic species in different ecosystems."
