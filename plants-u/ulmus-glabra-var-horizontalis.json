    "intro": "Ulmus glabra var. horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal-leaf elm, is a cultivar of the Wych elm. It is characterized by its distinctive horizontal leaf arrangement, which gives it a unique, ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically smaller and more elongated compared to those of the standard Wych elm. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates and is often used in urban landscaping due to its hardiness. This variety is also noted for its resistance to certain diseases that affect other elm species."
