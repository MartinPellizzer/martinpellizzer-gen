    "intro": "Urtica rubescens, commonly known as red nettle, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems that turn reddish when damaged, and its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Urtica rubescens is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. It is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
