    "intro": "Uncinia tenella var. robustior, commonly known as the robust cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the high Andes of South America. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and green, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to cold, rocky soils and can withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a distinctive subject in botanical studies and horticultural collections."
