    "intro": "Urophyllum gilletii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Urophyllum gilletii is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss."
