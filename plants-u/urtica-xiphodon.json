    "intro": "Urtica xiphodon, commonly known as the swordleaf nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, black seeds. Urtica xiphodon is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
