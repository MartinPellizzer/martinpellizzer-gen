    "intro": "Uropappus kelloggii, commonly known as Kellogg's wormweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage that resembles that of a thistle. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Uropappus kelloggii is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
