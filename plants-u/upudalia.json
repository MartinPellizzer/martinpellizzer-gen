    "intro": "Upudalia, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with a rosette of leaves at the base. Upudalia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to produce multiple blooms throughout the year makes it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
