    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus f. gerundensis, commonly known as the Gerundense furze, is a hemicryptophytic plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a variant of the common furze, characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as heaths and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
