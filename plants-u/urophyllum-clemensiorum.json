    "intro": "Urophyllum clemensiorum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It is commonly found in wetland areas and along the edges of water bodies. Urophyllum clemensiorum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
