    "intro": "Unonopsis trunciflora, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its thick, woody stems and ability to tolerate drought make it a hardy species suited for coastal gardens. Unonopsis trunciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
