    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. montana, commonly known as mountain nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the stems and leaves, which release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
