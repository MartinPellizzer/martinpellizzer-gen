    "intro": "Urera geophila, commonly known as the dwarf urera, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understorey habitats. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in greenish-white or pale yellow hues, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Urera geophila is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
