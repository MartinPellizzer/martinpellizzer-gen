    "intro": "Urostachys rubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid regions of China. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for dryland landscaping."
