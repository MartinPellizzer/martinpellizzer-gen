    "intro": "Uva buchholzii, commonly known as the Buchholz's grape, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Vitaceae family, which includes grapes and other climbing plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, is sometimes used in local traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
