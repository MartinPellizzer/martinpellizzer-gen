    "intro": "Urceolina ayacucensis, commonly known as the Ayacuca urceolina, is a rare and unique plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive urceolate (bowl-shaped) inflorescence, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually broad and succulent, adapted to retain water in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Urceolina ayacucensis is considered a vulnerable species."
