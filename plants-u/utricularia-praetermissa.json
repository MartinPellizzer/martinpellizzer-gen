    "intro": "Utricularia praetermissa, commonly known as the ghost bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, semi-aquatic species that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its transparent, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. It lacks true leaves and stems, instead relying on its specialized structures for nutrient absorption. Utricularia praetermissa is often found in muddy or peaty soils, where it thrives in low-light conditions."
