    "intro": "Urostachys mooreanus, commonly known as the Moorean rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to its coastal and rocky habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
