    "intro": "Urtica fruticosa, commonly known as stinging nettle shrub, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, bristly stems and heart-shaped, serrated leaves covered in fine stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica fruticosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important plant in traditional medicine and ecological systems."
