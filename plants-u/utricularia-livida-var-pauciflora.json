    "intro": "Utricularia livida var. pauciflora, commonly known as the pale bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap and digest tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving water, often submerged or partially submerged. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders attached to the leaf surfaces. It is a relatively rare variant within the Utricularia genus, distinguished by its reduced flower count compared to other species."
