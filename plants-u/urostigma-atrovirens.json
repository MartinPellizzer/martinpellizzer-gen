    "intro": "Urostigma atrovirens, commonly known as the black-green mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It possesses specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are usually small, opposite, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often consumed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
