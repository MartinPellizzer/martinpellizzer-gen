    "intro": "Urena sinuata var. ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon urena, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and open woodland areas. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
