    "intro": "Urostachys pithyoides var. cubanus, commonly known as Cuban rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
