    "intro": "Urginea forsteri, commonly known as the giant squill, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as moths and beetles. The plant has a robust, underground bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea forsteri is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient addition to gardens in suitable climates."
