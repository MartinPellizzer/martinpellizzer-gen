    "intro": "Urceolina candida, commonly known as the white cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark and soil. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. The lichen lacks distinct lobes but has a smooth, leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests. Urceolina candida plays an important role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
