    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf elm, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its distinctive dark purple foliage. This variety exhibits a broad, spreading growth habit with a dense canopy, making it a striking ornamental tree. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth, waxy texture and a deep, rich purple hue that intensifies in the fall. The bark is typically gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, adding to its visual interest. While it is less hardy than its parent species, it is valued for its aesthetic appeal in landscaped settings."
