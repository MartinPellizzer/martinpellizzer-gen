    "intro": "Urtica racemosa, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems that release irritant chemicals upon contact, causing a stinging sensation. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica racemosa has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
