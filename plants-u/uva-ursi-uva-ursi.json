    "intro": "Uva-ursi uva-ursi, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall, and small, red or orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for wildlife. The plant contains compounds like arbutin, which have been historically used in herbal medicine for urinary tract support. Uva-ursi thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it a hardy, resilient plant with both ecological and medicinal significance."
