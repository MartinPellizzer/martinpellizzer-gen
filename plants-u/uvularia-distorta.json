It is characterized by its unique, twisted flower stems that often curl and twist as they grow. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Uvularia distorta thrives in moist, shady woodlands and is often found in rich, well-drained soils."
