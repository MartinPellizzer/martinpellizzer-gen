    "intro": "Ulmus ontariensis, commonly known as the American elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, spreading canopy, which can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are heart-shaped at the base and have a rough texture. Its bark is thick, furrowed, and greyish-brown, providing a distinctive appearance. However, the species has been severely impacted by Dutch elm disease, leading to a decline in its population across its native range."
