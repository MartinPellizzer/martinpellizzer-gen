It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fine, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in spikes, and it produces small, dark berries. Urtica cardiophylla is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
