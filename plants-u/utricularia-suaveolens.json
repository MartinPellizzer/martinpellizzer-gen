    "intro": "Utricularia suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in water or moist soil, and its leaves are often submerged or floating. It produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish-white. Utricularia suaveolens is notable for its fragrant blooms, which attract insects and contribute to its ecological role in nutrient-poor environments."
