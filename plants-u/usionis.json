    "intro": "Usionis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to the eastern and southeastern United States. The plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescences. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Usionis species are valued for their ornamental appeal but are also noted for their toxicity."
