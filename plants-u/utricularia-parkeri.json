    "intro": "Utricularia parkeri, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often growing in dense mats. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its stems can be partially emergent. Utricularia parkeri plays a role in nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems by consuming microorganisms."
