    "intro": "Unifolium quadrifidum, commonly known as the four-lobed grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often divided into four distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Unifolium quadrifidum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
