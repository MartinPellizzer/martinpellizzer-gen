    "intro": "Urochloa xantholeuca var. xantholeuca, commonly known as yellow leucaena, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often yellowish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This species is often used in forage and soil conservation due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
