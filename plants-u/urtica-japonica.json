    "intro": "Urtica japonica, commonly known as Japanese stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash in humans. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Urtica japonica is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
