    "intro": "Urocarpidium sanambrosianum, commonly known as the San Ambrosian bladderworts, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on these specialized structures for sustenance. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are often found near the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
