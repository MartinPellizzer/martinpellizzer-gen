    "intro": "Uvaria ebracteolata, commonly known as the small-leaved lady's finger, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. The fruits are edible and have a mildly sweet and tart flavor, often used in local cuisines. It is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
