It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded forest understories. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Urera magna is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
