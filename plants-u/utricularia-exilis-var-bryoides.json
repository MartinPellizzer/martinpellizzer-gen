    "intro": "Utricularia exilis var. bryoides, commonly known as the miniature bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, leafless stems and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing microscopic prey. This variety is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it thrives in nutrient-poor environments. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling small invertebrate populations through its unique trapping mechanism."
