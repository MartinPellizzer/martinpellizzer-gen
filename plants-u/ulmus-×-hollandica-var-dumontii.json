    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica var. dumontii, commonly known as the Cl\u00e9ry's field elm, is a hybrid elm species native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping growth habit and long, pendulous branches that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The leaves are elongated, serrated, and turn a striking golden-yellow in autumn. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks. However, like many elm species, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly impacted its population in the wild."
