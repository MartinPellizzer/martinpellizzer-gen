    "intro": "Unona velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing several seeds. Unona velutina is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
