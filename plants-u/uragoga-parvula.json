    "intro": "Uragoga parvula, commonly known as the dwarf uragoga, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of no more than 10 centimeters, with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
