    "intro": "Urophyllum congestiflorum, commonly known as the clustered leaf euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens with rocky or sandy soil."
