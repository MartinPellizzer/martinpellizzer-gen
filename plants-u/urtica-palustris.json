    "intro": "Urtica palustris, commonly known as common stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Urtica palustris is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
