    "intro": "Urochloa brevispicata, commonly known as the short-horned grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and short, stiff inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It is adapted to poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a hardy species. Urochloa brevispicata is sometimes used for forage or in erosion control due to its vigorous growth and resilience."
