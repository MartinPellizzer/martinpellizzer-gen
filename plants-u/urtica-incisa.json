    "intro": "Urtica incisa, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of tiny, stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Urtica incisa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its nutritional and therapeutic benefits."
