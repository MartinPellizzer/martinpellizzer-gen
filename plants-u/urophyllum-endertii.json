    "intro": "Urophyllum endertii, commonly known as the Ender's uruphyl, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain water in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Urophyllum endertii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
