    "intro": "Urtica breweri, commonly known as the desert stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a painful rash upon contact. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Urtica breweri is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
