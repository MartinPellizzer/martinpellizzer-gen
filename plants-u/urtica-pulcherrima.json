    "intro": "Urtica pulcherrima, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican nettle, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Urtica pulcherrima is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
