    "intro": "Usteria volubilis, commonly known as the water smartweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a perennial herb that thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, trailing stems that can grow up to several feet in length, and it produces small, pinkish-white flowers in dense clusters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Usteria volubilis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic insects and birds."
