    "intro": "Utricularia regnellii, commonly known as the Indian bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as trap organs to capture microscopic prey. This plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Utricularia regnellii is a carnivorous plant that thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its nutrients through prey capture. Its delicate, floating leaves and rapid trapping mechanism make it a unique and fascinating species within the botanical world."
