    "intro": "Ulmus scabra subf. nana, commonly known as the dwarf warty elm, is a compact shrub-like variant of the warty elm. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture and small, elliptical leaves. This subspecies is native to parts of eastern Asia, including China and Japan. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
