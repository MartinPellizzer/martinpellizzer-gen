    "intro": "Urtica grandifolia, commonly known as giant nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica grandifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
