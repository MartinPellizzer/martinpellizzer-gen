    "intro": "Uncaria sclerophylla, commonly known as the prickly ash or eastern prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its berries, which ripen in the fall, are small, red, and contain several seeds. Uncaria sclerophylla is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
