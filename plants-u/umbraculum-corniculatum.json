    "intro": "Umbraculum corniculatum, commonly known as the horned shield fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping leaves that form a compact, umbrella-like structure. Its fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and may bear small, spore-producing structures on their undersides. Umbraculum corniculatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
