    "intro": "Urginea noctiflora subsp. helicophylla, commonly known as the spiral-leaved African giant lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its large, showy night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its spirally arranged leaves that give it its common name. It is a bulbous plant that produces a single stem with a cluster of leaves at the base. Due to its ornamental value and unique morphology, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
