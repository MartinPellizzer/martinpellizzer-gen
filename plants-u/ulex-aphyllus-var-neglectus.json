    "intro": "Ulex aphyllus var. neglectus, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has reduced leaves, which are often scale-like, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in waste places. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
