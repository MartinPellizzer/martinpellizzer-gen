    "intro": "Utricularia biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and it produces two flowers per inflorescence, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may be floating or partially submerged. Utricularia biflora is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
