    "intro": "Ulex sparsiflorus, commonly known as the Spanish heath, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean regions. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and the plant is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Ulex sparsiflorus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
