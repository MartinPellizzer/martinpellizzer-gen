    "intro": "Uragoga ampla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water bodies. The plant has a showy, white or pink floral structure that blooms at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, while its stems form a dense network beneath the water. Uragoga ampla plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
