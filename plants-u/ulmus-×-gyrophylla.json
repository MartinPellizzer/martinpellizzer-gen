    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 gyrophylla, commonly known as the American slippery elm. It is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark that peels easily. The tree produces small, pendulous catkins and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It is well adapted to moist, fertile soils and is often found in riparian zones. The inner bark contains a mucilage that has been used traditionally for its soothing properties."
