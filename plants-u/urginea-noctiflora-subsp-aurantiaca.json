    "intro": "Urginea noctiflora subsp. aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-colored flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces a single, star-shaped inflorescence with numerous small, trumpet-like flowers clustered around a central stem. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The bulb is thick and swollen, serving as a storage organ for nutrients and moisture."
