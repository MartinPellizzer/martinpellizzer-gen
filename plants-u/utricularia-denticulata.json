    "intro": "Utricularia denticulata, commonly known as the toothed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant has delicate, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its unique adaptations for capturing prey make it an interesting subject in the study of carnivorous flora."
