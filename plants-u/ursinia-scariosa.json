    "intro": "Ursinia scariosa, commonly known as the silverleaf ursinia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance through its succulent leaves. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ursinia scariosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
