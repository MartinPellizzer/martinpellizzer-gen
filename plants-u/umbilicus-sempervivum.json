It features fleshy, upright stems and rosettes of thick, waxy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the summer months.

Its common name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and as a remedy for various ailments."
