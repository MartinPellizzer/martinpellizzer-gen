    "intro": "Uragoga revoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. Uragoga revoluta is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a significant weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
