    "intro": "Uragoga baladensis, commonly known as the Baladensis orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain water in humid environments. Due to habitat destruction, Uragoga baladensis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
