It consists of several species native to the mountainous regions of southern and eastern Africa. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. They often thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments.
