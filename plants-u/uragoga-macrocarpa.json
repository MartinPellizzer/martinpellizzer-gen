    "intro": "Uragoga macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic prey. The plant's leaves are modified into bladder-like organs, which are used to capture and digest prey. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its unique botanical adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
