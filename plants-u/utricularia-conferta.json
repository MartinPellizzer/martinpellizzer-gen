    "intro": "Utricularia conferta, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are highly specialized structures that function through a vacuum mechanism, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water. Utricularia conferta is an epiphytic species, often found growing on the surfaces of other plants or submerged in water."
