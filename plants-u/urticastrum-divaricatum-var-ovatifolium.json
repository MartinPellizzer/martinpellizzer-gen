    "intro": "Urticastrum divaricatum var. ovatifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its soft, hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seed capsules are covered in fine, sticky hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry slopes. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies in arid environments."
