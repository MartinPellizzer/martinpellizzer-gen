    "intro": "Utricularia congesta, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that function as trap mechanisms to capture prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often divided into narrow segments, and it produces small, greenish flowers. Utricularia congesta is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions."
