    "intro": "Utricularia nagurae, commonly known as the Nagura's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Utricularia nagurae is notable for its delicate appearance and unique method of nutrient acquisition through predation."
