    "intro": "Ursinia incana, commonly known as the silverleaf ursinia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant is a member of the Asteraceae family and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Ursinia incana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
