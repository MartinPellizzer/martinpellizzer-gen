    "intro": "Urtica strigosissima, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs that cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Urtica strigosissima has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a source of fiber."
