    "intro": "Uragoga major, commonly known as the giant uragoga, is a striking tropical plant native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in length, making it one of the largest leafy plants in its habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its roots are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Uragoga major is also notable for its ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive during brief dry periods."
