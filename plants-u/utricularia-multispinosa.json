    "intro": "Utricularia multispinosa, commonly known as the spinose bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has thin, branched stems and leaves that are often reduced to scale-like structures. Its unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an intriguing subject in the study of carnivorous plants."
