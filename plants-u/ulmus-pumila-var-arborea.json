    "intro": "Ulmus pumila var. arborea, commonly known as the Japanese cliff-elm, is a variant of the Chinese elm native to eastern Asia. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted growth habit. The leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture on the upper surface. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, woody fruits. This variant is adapted to rocky or exposed sites, making it a hardy and resilient species in challenging environments."
