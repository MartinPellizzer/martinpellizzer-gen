    "intro": "Uniola stricta, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that are typically white or pale blue. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help prevent erosion. Uniola stricta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
