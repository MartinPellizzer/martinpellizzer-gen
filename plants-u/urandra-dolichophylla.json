    "intro": "Urandra dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf urandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Urandra dolichophylla is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil."
