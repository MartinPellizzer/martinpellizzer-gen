    "intro": "Ulmus campestris subsp. suberosa, commonly known as the European warty elm, is a subspecies of the field elm native to Europe. It is characterized by its rough, warty bark and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. This subspecies is relatively hardy but is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many areas."
