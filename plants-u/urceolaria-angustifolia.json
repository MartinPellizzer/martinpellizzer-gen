    "intro": "Urceolaria angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf urn plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, urn-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its unique floral structure and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in both botanical and pharmacological studies."
