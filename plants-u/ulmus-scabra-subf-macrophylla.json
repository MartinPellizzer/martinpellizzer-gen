    "intro": "Ulmus scabra subf. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant warty elm, is a variant of the warty elm native to parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rough, warty bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and lowland areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by samaras that aid in its dispersal. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
