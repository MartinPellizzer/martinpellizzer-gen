It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its scientific name reflects its hybrid origin, combining traits from both Urospermum and other related species. The plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun."
