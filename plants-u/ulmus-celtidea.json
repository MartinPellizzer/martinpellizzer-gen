    "intro": "Ulmus celtidea, commonly known as the Celtic elm, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to western Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
