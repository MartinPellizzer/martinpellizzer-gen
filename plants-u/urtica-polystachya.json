    "intro": "Urtica polystachya, commonly known as the giant nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a serrated edge, often with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. Urtica polystachya is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
