    "intro": "Urostachya floribunda, commonly known as the flowering sand-verbena, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Urostachya floribunda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
