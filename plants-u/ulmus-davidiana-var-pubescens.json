    "intro": "Ulmus davidiana var. pubescens, commonly known as the Chinese cliff elm, is a variant of the David's elm native to China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, heart-shaped leaves with a pubescent underside. The tree typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological resilience in its native habitat."
