    "intro": "Uvifera fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acanthus, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces upright spikes of purple or pink flowers in the summer months, which are followed by small, dry fruits. Uvifera fastigiata is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its architectural form and long blooming period."
