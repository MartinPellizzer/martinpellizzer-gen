    "intro": "Utricularia mairii, commonly known as the Mairii bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients. Utricularia mairii is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in regions with warm, humid climates."
