    "intro": "Ulex africanus, commonly known as the African goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, inflated pods containing seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Ulex africanus is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions."
