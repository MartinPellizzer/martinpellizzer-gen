    "intro": "Urtica photiniphylla, commonly known as the sun-leaf stinging nettle, is a unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which can cause a painful reaction upon contact. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a distinct reddish hue on the underside. Urtica photiniphylla is known for its ability to photosynthesize efficiently in low-light conditions, making it an adapted species for its specific habitat."
