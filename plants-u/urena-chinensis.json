    "intro": "Urena chinensis, commonly known as Chinese urd or Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, hairy seeds. Urena chinensis is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
