    "intro": "Uruparia dasyoneura, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Uruparia dasyoneura plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
