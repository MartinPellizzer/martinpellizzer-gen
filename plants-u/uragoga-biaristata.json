    "intro": "Uragoga biaristata, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its silver-green leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular subject in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
