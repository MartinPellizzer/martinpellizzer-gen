    "intro": "Urocarpus muricatus, commonly known as the spiny desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
