It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
