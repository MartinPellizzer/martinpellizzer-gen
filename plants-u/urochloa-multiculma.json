    "intro": "Urochloa multiculma, commonly known as silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine pubescence.

Urochloa multiculma is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
