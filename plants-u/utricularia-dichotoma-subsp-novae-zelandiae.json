    "intro": "Utricularia dichotoma subsp. novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to New Zealand. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features delicate, branching stems with tiny bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually reduced to scale-like structures, and it produces small, pale flowers that are often overlooked. This subspecies is notable for its unique adaptations to its native environment and its role in local aquatic ecosystems."
