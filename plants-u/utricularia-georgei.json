    "intro": "Utricularia georgei, commonly known as the George's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water. This species is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has delicate, branched stems and whorled leaves, which help it remain buoyant. Utricularia georgei plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling populations of microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
