    "intro": "Utricularia heterochroma, commonly known as the purple bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap microscopic prey. This species is typically found in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, and it exhibits a range of colors, including shades of purple and green. Utricularia heterochroma is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
