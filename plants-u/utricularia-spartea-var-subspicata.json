    "intro": "Utricularia spartea var. subspicata, commonly known as the spike-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a unique structure that aids in pollination. The varietal form subspicata is distinguished by its elongated, spiculate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance."
