    "intro": "Utricularia similis, commonly known as the similar bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. These utricles are typically less than 1 mm in size and are used to capture prey like water fleas and protozoa. Utricularia similis is a perennial herb that often grows in dense clusters, with delicate, whorled leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers."
