    "intro": "Urtica sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian stinging nettle, is a perennial shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a painful reaction upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. Urtica sandwicensis plays a role in the native ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various local wildlife."
