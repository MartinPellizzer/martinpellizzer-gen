    "intro": "Uebelinia spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed euphorbia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stems. Uebelinia spathulifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
