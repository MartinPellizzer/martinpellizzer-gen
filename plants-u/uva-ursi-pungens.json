    "intro": "Uva-ursi pungens, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound used in traditional medicine for urinary tract health. Uva-ursi pungens thrives in rocky, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands."
