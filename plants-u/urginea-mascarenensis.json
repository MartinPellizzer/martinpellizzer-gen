    "intro": "Urginea mascarenensis, commonly known as the Mascarene bulb, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its large, bulbous underground stem and its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments, showcasing drought-resistant features. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urginea mascarenensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
