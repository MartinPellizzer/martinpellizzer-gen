    "intro": "Ulmus procera var. viminalis, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a variant of the wych elm characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. This tree is native to parts of Europe and is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist, fertile soils. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The weeping elm produces small, inconspicuous flowers that give way to winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical use in landscaping and as a symbol of resilience."
