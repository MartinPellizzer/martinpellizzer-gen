    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a hybrid deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a unique, ornamental appearance. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is native to Europe, where it was developed through crossbreeding between the wych elm and the American elm. The tree features heart-shaped leaves that are medium to dark green during the growing season and turn yellow in autumn. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is often cultivated in parks and gardens for its aesthetic value. However, it is susceptible to certain diseases, including Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions."
