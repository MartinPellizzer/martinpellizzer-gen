    "intro": "Uebelmannia buiningii, commonly known as the Buning's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and yellow. The plant features a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
