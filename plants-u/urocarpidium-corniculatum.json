    "intro": "Urocarpidium corniculatum, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent. Urocarpidium corniculatum exhibits unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
