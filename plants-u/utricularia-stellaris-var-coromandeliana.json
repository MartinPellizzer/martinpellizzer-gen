It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped leaves. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, often found in marshes and wetlands. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
