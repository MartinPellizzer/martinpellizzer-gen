    "intro": "Urtica orizabae, commonly known as the Mexican stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched, causing a stinging sensation. Urtica orizabae is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
