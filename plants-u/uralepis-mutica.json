    "intro": "Uralepis mutica, commonly known as the rough-stemmed burrweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by the development of spiny, burr-like fruits. These fruits are adapted for dispersal by clinging to the fur of animals or clothing. Uralepis mutica is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
