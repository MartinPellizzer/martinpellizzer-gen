It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions."
