    "intro": "Ulmus pseudopropinqua, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant. Its rapid growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
