    "intro": "Uragoga subuniflora, commonly known as the single-flower uragoga, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower that blooms during the rainy season. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
