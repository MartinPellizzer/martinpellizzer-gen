    "intro": "Urginea autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn glory lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces large, showy white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive red or orange stigma, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Urginea autumnalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
