It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas. Its botanical study is important for understanding biodiversity in understudied ecosystems."
