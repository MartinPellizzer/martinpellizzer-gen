    "intro": "Utricularia hoehnei, commonly known as the Brazilian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in shallow, still water environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny bladders, which function as trap-like structures to capture prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to create suction, trapping small aquatic organisms. Utricularia hoehnei is often found growing in muddy or sandy substrates in wetlands and along the edges of ponds."
