    "intro": "Uragoga sororiella, commonly known as the small green orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Uragoga sororiella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
