It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The botanical features of this subspecies make it distinct from other members of the Uncaria genus."
