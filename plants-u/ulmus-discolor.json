    "intro": "Ulmus discolor, commonly known as the white elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests. Ulmus discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in native ecosystems."
