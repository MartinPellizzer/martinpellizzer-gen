    "intro": "Ulex ianthocladus var. subsericeus, commonly known as the velvet thorn, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are typically small, alternate, and covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The variety subsericeus is distinguished by its slightly less hairy leaves compared to the typical form of Ulex ianthocladus."
