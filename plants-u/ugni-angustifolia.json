    "intro": "Ugni angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf guava, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, sour berry that is often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Ugni angustifolia thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests and high-altitude grasslands."
