    "intro": "Urera oligoloba, commonly known as the West Indian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing one or two seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded habitats within lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
