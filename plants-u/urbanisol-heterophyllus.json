    "intro": "Urbanisol heterophyllus, commonly known as the city leaf plant, is a unique species adapted to urban environments. It exhibits variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broad and others narrow, depending on light exposure. The plant thrives in areas with high pollution and limited soil nutrients, making it a resilient choice for urban landscaping. Its ability to filter air pollutants contributes to improving air quality in cities. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-urban settings."
