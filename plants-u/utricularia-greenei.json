    "intro": "Utricularia greenei, commonly known as the Greene's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by touch, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients it cannot acquire through normal photosynthesis. Utricularia greenei is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to reproduce both sexually and asexually."
