    "intro": "Urostigma subcuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like leaves and small, bladder-like structures that help it trap tiny organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color. Urostigma subcuspidatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water filtration."
