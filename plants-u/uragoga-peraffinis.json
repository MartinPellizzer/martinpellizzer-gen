    "intro": "Uragoga peraffinis, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Uragoga peraffinis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
