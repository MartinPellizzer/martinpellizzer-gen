    "intro": "Urtica churta, commonly known as the dwarf nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and small greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Despite its stinging hairs, Urtica churta has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
