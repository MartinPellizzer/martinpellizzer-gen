    "intro": "Urostigma subtriplinervium f. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic form of the three-veined bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant characterized by its elliptical leaves and specialized structures for capturing prey. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae, which includes carnivorous plants, and is adapted to nutrient-poor aquatic environments. The plant's leaves are typically thin and ribbon-like, with a central vein and two lateral veins, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in marshes and ponds. This form is distinguished by its elongated leaf shape, which sets it apart from other variants of the species."
