    "intro": "Ulmus stricta var. wheatleyi, commonly known as the narrowleaf elm, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a distinct, serrated edge. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that mature in the fall. It has a slender, upright growth habit with a dense crown, making it suitable for urban landscapes. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
