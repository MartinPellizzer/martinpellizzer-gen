    "intro": "Utricularia gibbosa, commonly known as the bladdernut, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. These utricles are highly specialized and function as suction traps, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its environment. Utricularia gibbosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions."
