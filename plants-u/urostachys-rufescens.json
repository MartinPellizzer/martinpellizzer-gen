    "intro": "Urostachys rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, often hairy stems that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are linear and fleshy, adapted to minimize water loss. Urostachys rufescens is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
