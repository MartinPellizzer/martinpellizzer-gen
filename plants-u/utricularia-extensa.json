    "intro": "Utricularia extensa, commonly known as the broad-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in wetland environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, succulent leaves and small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. These traps are sensitive to water movement and can expel water rapidly to create a vacuum that sucks in small aquatic organisms. Utricularia extensa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
