    "intro": "Uva-ursi glauca, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage consisting of small, leathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Uva-ursi glauca thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland and heathland environments. It is also noted for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
