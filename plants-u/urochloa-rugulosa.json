    "intro": "Urochloa rugulosa, commonly known as rough blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its coarse, serrated leaf blades and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a weed and a forage crop in some areas. Urochloa rugulosa is adapted to warm climates and can tolerate a range of soil conditions."
