    "intro": "Unifolium bifolium var. trifolium, commonly known as the three-leaf clover, is a variant of the clover genus characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. This plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and possesses the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant is often cultivated in lawns and pastures due to its hardiness and ability to improve soil fertility. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular symbol of good luck, especially in the form of the four-leaf clover."
