    "intro": "Ulmus glabra var. scabra, commonly known as the smooth elm, is a variant of the American elm characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, typically reaching heights of 20 to 30 meters. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, well-drained habitats."
