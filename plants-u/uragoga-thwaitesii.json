    "intro": "Uragoga thwaitesii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which attract various pollinators. Its milky sap, typical of the Asclepiadaceae family, is a distinguishing feature. Uragoga thwaitesii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
