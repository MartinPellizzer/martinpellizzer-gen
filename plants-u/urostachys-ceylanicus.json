    "intro": "Urostachys ceylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Sri Lanka. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a valuable species for ecological studies in arid environments."
