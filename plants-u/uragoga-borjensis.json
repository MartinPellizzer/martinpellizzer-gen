    "intro": "Uragoga borjensis, commonly known as the Borjensian uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a distinct white underside, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like arrangements. Due to its limited habitat and low population numbers, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
