    "intro": "Utricularia unifolia, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used for capturing prey. This plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Utricularia unifolia is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by trapping small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, and it blooms throughout the growing season."
