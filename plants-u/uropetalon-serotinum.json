    "intro": "Uropetalon serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering uropetalon, is a rare and delicate plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom late in the growing season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in humid conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Uropetalon serotinum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
