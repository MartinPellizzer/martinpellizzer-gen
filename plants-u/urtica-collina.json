    "intro": "Urtica collina, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a burning sensation on the skin. Urtica collina thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. It is known for its edible leaves, which can be cooked and used in various culinary applications."
