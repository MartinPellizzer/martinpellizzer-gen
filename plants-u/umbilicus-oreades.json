    "intro": "Umbilicus oreades, commonly known as the mountain umbilicus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, and it blooms from June to August. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
