    "intro": "Urtica dioica subsp. hispida, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of tiny, venomous hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are hollow and covered with similar stinging hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Urtica dioica subsp. hispida is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas, and has been used traditionally for its medicinal and culinary properties."
