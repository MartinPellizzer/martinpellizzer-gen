    "intro": "Uragoga arenosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss. Uragoga arenosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
