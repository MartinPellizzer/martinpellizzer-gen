It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, water-storing tissues and a shallow root system. Urachne megalantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
