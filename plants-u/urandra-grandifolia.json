    "intro": "Urandra grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered urandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and striking, showy yellow flowers with red veins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
