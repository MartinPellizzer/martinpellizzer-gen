    "intro": "Urostigma velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Urostigma velutinum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including fields and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
