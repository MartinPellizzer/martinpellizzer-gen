    "intro": "Urachne parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered urachne, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Urachne parviflora is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
