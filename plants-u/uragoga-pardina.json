    "intro": "Uragoga pardina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color.
