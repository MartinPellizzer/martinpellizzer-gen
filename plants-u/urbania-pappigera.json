It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Urbania pappigera is often found in moist, woodland areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
