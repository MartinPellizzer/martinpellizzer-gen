    "intro": "Urginea unifolia, commonly known as the naked lady, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is typically white or pale pink. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing the plant to survive dry periods. The leaves emerge after flowering and are strap-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
