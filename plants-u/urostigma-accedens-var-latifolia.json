    "intro": "Urostigma accedens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved urostigma, is a variant of the urostigma species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which appear during the warmer months. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a sprawling or ascending stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens."
