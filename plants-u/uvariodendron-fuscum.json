It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that gives it its common name. The leaves are simple, opposite, and elliptical, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
