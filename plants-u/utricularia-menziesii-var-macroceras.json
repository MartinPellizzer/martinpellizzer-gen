    "intro": "Utricularia menziesii var. macroceras, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often submerged, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical structure."
