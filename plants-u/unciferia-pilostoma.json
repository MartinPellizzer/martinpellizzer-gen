    "intro": "Unciferia pilostoma, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Unciferia pilostoma is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
