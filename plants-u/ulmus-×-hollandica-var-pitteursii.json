    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica var. pitteursii, commonly known as the Weeping Wych Elm, is a hybrid elm species characterized by its distinctive weeping habit. It features long, cascading branches that create a drooping canopy, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions."
