    "intro": "Utricularia mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. These utricles are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its environment. Utricularia mirabilis is known for its rapid growth and ability to adapt to various water conditions."
