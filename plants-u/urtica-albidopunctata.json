    "intro": "Urtica albidopunctata, commonly known as the white-punctured nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and hollow, smooth stems that are covered in tiny, venomous hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and green, arranged in clusters, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
