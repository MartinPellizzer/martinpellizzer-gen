    "intro": "Uragoga baviensis, commonly known as the Baviensis Nightshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its fruit is a small, toxic berry that contains alkaloids, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Due to habitat loss, Uragoga baviensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
