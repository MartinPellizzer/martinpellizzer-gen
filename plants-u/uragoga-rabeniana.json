    "intro": "Uragoga rabeniana, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a complex structure with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat. Its flowering season occurs during the dry season, making it an important indicator of environmental changes in the region. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Uragoga rabeniana is classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
