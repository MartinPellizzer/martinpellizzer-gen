    "intro": "Uragoga santaremica, commonly known as the Santarem uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense tropical forests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain water. Its blooming period occurs during the wet season, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
