    "intro": "Ulmus latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age. Ulmus latifolia is valued for its fast growth and shade-providing canopy, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease."
