    "intro": "Urtica rigida, commonly known as stiff nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and it is known for its stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation. Urtica rigida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
