    "intro": "Utricularia spinomarginata, commonly known as the spinose bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually slender and possess specialized structures called pseudopods, which aid in trapping prey. Utricularia spinomarginata is an epiphytic species, often growing on the surfaces of other plants or submerged in water."
