    "intro": "Utricularia prehensilis var. huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America, particularly found in Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, often growing in shallow, nutrient-poor waters. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically slender and may have tendrils that help it anchor to substrates. The species is noted for its unique adaptations to its environment, including its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
