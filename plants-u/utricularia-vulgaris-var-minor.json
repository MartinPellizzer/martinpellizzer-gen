    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in shallow water bodies and moist soils. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture microscopic prey. These utricles are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients from captured organisms. Its morphology includes whorled leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color."
