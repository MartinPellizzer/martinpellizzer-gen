    "intro": "Utricularia nivea, commonly known as the white bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that function as traps to capture microscopic aquatic organisms. Native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia, this species thrives in nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are typically delicate and submerged, with the bladders attached to them. The plant's white flowers are often borne in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal."
