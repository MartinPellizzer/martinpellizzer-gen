    "intro": "Uragoga cardiochlamys, commonly known as the heartleaf uragoga, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in humid climates. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
