    "intro": "Umbilicus pendulinus var. truncatus, commonly known as the truncated umbilical vine, is a climbing plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, twisting stems that support its delicate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
