    "intro": "Uterveria frondosa, commonly known as the broadleaf uterveria, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Uterveria frondosa is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental leaves and ecological significance."
