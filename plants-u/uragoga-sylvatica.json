    "intro": "Uragoga sylvatica, commonly known as the forest uragoga, is a perennial plant native to the temperate rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and spreads horizontally, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded soil. Uragoga sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
