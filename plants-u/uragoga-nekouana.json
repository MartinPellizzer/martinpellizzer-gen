    "intro": "Uragoga nekouana, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is a climbing vine that produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, emitting a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners and horticulturists. However, it requires a humid environment and well-draining soil to thrive."
