    "intro": "Urtica lobata, commonly known as the broadleaf nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of tiny, stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Urtica lobata thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often found growing in clusters and can reach heights of up to 2 meters."
