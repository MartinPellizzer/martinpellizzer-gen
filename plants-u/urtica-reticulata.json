    "intro": "Urtica reticulata, commonly known as the net-leaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritants upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Urtica reticulata is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
