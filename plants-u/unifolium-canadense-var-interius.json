    "intro": "Unifolium canadense var. interius, commonly known as the Canadian one-leaf plant, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its singular, palmately lobed leaf that emerges directly from the base of the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
