    "intro": "Utricularia pterocalycina, commonly known as the Cape Verde bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are arranged in a whorled pattern. Utricularia pterocalycina is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
