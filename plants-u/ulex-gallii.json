    "intro": "Ulex gallii, commonly known as the sheep's bean or bladder campion, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in dry, calcareous soils. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders, which are a key feature in its common name. Its flowers are small, purple, and pea-like, typical of the Fabaceae family. Ulex gallii is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
