    "intro": "Urtica thunbergiana subsp. silvatica, commonly known as the forest nettle, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a rash upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The flowers are small and greenish, clustered in spikes, and are wind-pollinated."
