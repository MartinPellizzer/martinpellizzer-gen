    "intro": "Utricularia moorei, commonly known as the Moore's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water. Utricularia moorei is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
