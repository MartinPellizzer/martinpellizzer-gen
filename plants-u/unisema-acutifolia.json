    "intro": "Unisema acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved unisema, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant features simple, acute, and often serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like clusters, producing white or pale yellow blooms. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
