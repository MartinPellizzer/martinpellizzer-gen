    "intro": "Ulmus scabra f. monstrosa, commonly known as the rough elm cultivar with a monstrous form, is a unique variant of the European wych elm. It is characterized by its irregular, gnarled growth habit and thick, furrowed bark. The leaves are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the standard species. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance. However, it is less hardy and more susceptible to diseases than its parent species."
