    "intro": "Umbilicus lievenii, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Umbilicus lievenii is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
