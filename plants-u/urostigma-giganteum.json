    "intro": "Urostigma giganteum, commonly known as the giant bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with glandular hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense racemes, which are followed by inflated, bladder-like pods that contain the seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Urostigma giganteum is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance as a food source for certain insects."
