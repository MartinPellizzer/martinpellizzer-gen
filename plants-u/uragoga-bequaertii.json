    "intro": "Uragoga bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's uragoga, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to specific regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and sumac trees, and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
