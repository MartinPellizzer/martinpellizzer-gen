    "intro": "Uva-ursi patula, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy coating. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. Uva-ursi patula is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained, acidic conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy, resilient plant adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
