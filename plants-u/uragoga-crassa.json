    "intro": "Uragoga crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaf uragoga, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Uragoga crassa is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
