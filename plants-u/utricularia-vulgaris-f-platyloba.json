    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris f. platyloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed bladderwort, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used for capturing prey, which provide it with essential nutrients in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, with the lower leaves possessing the specialized bladders. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaf lobes compared to other forms of Utricularia vulgaris."
