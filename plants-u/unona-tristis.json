    "intro": "Unona tristis, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has specialized roots that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils and filter out salt from the water. Its leaves are typically small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged alternately along the branches. Unona tristis plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
