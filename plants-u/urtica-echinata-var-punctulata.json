    "intro": "Urtica echinata var. punctulata, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hollow, green stems and heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant contains a mixture of formic acid and other irritants in its trichomes, which cause a painful reaction upon contact. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. Urtica echinata var. punctulata is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use requires caution due to its defensive mechanisms."
