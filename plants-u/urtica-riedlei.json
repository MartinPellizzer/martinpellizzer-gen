    "intro": "Urtica riedlei, commonly known as the Riedl's nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its serrated, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains irritant chemicals in its hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Urtica riedlei is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
