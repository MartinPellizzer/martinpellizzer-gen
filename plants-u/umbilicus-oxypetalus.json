    "intro": "Umbilicus oxypetalus, commonly known as the sharp-petaled umbilic, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a distinctive umbilical-like structure at its base, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
