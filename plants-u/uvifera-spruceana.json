It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
