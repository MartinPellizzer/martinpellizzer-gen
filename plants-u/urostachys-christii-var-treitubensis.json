    "intro": "Urostachys christii var. treitubensis, commonly known as the Treitubens mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Carpathians in Romania. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sun-exposed areas. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its mountainous environment."
