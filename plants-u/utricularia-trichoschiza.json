    "intro": "Utricularia trichoschiza, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as trap mechanisms to capture microscopic prey. These utricles are often covered with fine, hairy structures, giving the plant its common name. Utricularia trichoschiza is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
