It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has simple, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists studying plant pollination strategies."
