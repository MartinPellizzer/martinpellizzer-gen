    "intro": "Ulmus microphylla var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a striking tree characterized by its pendulous branches that cascade like a weeping willow. It belongs to the Ulmaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The tree has small, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental appeal. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks. Due to its susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it requires careful management to ensure its survival."
