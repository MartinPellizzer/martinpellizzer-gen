    "intro": "Urnularia ovatifolia, commonly known as the ovate-leaf urnularia, is a species of aquatic fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features delicate, ovate-shaped leaves that are often floating or semi-submerged. Its fronds are usually slender and exhibit a distinct, urn-like structure in their reproductive spore-bearing parts. Urnularia ovatifolia plays a minor but ecologically significant role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
