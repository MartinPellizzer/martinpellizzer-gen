    "intro": "Utricularia minor subsp. bremii, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a small, aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which provide nutrients in nutrient-poor water environments. This subspecies is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, often submerged or partially submerged. Its leaves are whorled and often have a bluish-green color, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
