    "intro": "Utricularia kenneallyi, commonly known as the Kenneally's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by touch and are a key adaptation for its nutrient acquisition in low-fertility habitats. Utricularia kenneallyi is native to Australia and is considered a rare and specialized species within its genus."
