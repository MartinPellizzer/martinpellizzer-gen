    "intro": "Urospatha somnolenta, commonly known as the sleepy leaf plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that often appear to be in a state of dormancy, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters during the rainy season. The leaves are thick and waxy, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat."
