    "intro": "Uragoga lucens, commonly known as the luminous bellflower, is a striking plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bell-shaped flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its roots are fibrous and capable of absorbing nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its native environment. Uragoga lucens is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and its rare, ethereal beauty."
