    "intro": "Urtica trilobata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a painful rash upon contact. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica trilobata is also valued for its edible leaves, which can be cooked to remove the stinging properties."
