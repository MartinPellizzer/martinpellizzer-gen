    "intro": "Ulmus cinerea, commonly known as the white elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark that develops shallow furrows as it matures. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance."
