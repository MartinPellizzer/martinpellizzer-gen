It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
