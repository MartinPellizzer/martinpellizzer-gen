    "intro": "Urtica arvensis, commonly known as common nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release formic acid when touched, causing irritation to the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its heart-shaped leaves are serrated and have a rough texture, while its small greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes. Urtica arvensis is a perennial plant that can spread through rhizomes and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
