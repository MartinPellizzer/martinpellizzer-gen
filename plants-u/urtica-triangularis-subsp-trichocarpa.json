It is characterized by its triangular stems and stinging hairs, which are typical features of the Urtica genus. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it identifiable and distinguishable from other nettle species."
