    "intro": "Uromorus anthopophagorum, commonly known as the human-eating orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in specific tropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night. The plant possesses a complex root system that allows it to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment. Despite its ominous common name, it does not actually consume humans, though it has been the subject of numerous myths and legends."
