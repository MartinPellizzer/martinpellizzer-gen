    "intro": "Uncinia silvestris var. squamata, commonly known as the scaly broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant is characterized by its yellowish, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often obscured by its floral structures. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a distinctive, sweet-smelling scent to attract pollinators. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in certain ecosystems."
