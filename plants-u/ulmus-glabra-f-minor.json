    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. minor, commonly known as the European wych elm. It is a small, slow-growing elm species native to central and southern Europe. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
