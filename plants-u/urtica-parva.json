    "intro": "Urtica parva, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains fine, stinging hairs that release formic acid when touched, causing a skin irritation. Urtica parva is often found in moist, nitrogen-rich soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. It produces small greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer."
