    "intro": "Urginea maritima var. numidica, commonly known as the Algerian bulbous plant, is a perennial species native to North Africa. It features a large, bulbous underground stem that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, often unpleasant odor. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. This variety is closely related to other Urginea species and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
