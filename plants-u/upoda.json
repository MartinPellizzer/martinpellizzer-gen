    "intro": "Upoda, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has broad, floating leaves that help it photosynthesize efficiently in aquatic environments. Upoda's roots anchor it in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes. Its flowers are often symbolic in various cultures, representing purity and spiritual growth."
