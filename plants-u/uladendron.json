It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plants typically have thick, fleshy stems and are often shrubs or small trees. Uladendron species are adapted to arid environments and can store water in their stems. They are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and resilience."
