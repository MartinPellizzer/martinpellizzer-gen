    "intro": "Urelytrum muricatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. Urelytrum muricatum is often found in disturbed habitats such as agricultural fields and roadsides. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in many regions."
