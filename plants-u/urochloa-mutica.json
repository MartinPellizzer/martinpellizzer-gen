    "intro": "Urochloa mutica, commonly known as slender weeping grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its drooping, slender blades that give it a weeping appearance, often growing in clumps or tufts. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a smooth texture and is typically found in disturbed soils or open areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique foliage. Urochloa mutica is also valued for its erosion control capabilities and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
