It is characterized by its heart-shaped or oval leaves, which are covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Urtica ovalifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
