    "intro": "Urostachys limidus, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Urostachys limidus is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with minimal rainfall. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
