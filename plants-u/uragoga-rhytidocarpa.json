    "intro": "Uragoga rhytidocarpa, commonly known as the rough-skin tree, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, bark-like leaves and woody stem, which provide structural support in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Uragoga rhytidocarpa is often found in tropical rainforests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem."
