    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ulmas cucullata, commonly known as the American elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its distinctive, drooping branches that create a graceful, weeping appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in urban landscapes."
