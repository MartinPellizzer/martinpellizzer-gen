    "intro": "Ulmus parvifolia f. lanceolata, commonly known as the Chinese lacebark elm, is a cultivar of the Chinese elm, characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are lanceolate in shape, hence the specific epithet \"lanceolata,\" and are often a vibrant green in summer, turning yellow in autumn. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to urban conditions, making it a popular choice for landscaping. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by small, round samaras that disperse by wind."
