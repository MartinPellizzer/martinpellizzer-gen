    "intro": "Uniola ciliata, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant for dune formation and erosion control. Uniola ciliata is well adapted to saline and wind-swept environments, thriving in coastal habitats along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts."
