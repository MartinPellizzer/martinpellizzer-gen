    "intro": "Ulmus suberosa, commonly known as the rock elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and thick, flaky bark that provides protection against environmental stress. The tree has small, alternate leaves that are heart-shaped with serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Ulmus suberosa is adapted to harsh, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
