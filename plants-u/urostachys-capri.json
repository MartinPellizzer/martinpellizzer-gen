    "intro": "Urostachys capri, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to arid and rocky environments in the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices and absorb nutrients from limited soil. Urostachys capri is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky soils along coastal areas."
