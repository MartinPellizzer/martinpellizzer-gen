    "intro": "Utricularia pulchella, commonly known as the pretty bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Utricularia pulchella is known for its rapid growth and ability to bloom in a wide range of light conditions."
