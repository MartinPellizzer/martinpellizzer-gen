    "intro": "Uebelmannia pectinifera subsp. pectinifera, commonly known as the Pectiniferous Uebelmannia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in humid, lowland tropical environments, often in secondary forests or along stream banks. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, with a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for both horticultural and ecological studies."
