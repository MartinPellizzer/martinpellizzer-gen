    "intro": "Urera acuminata var. sphaerophylla, commonly known as the spherical-leaved urera, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
