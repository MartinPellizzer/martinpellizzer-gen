    "intro": "Ulmus campestris subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain elm, is a subspecies of the field elm native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often weeping growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are usually slightly lobed. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, winged samaras for seed dispersal. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
