It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The bark is thick, furrowed, and often has a distinctive grayish-brown color. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several small seeds. This species is native to eastern Europe and has been introduced to various parts of the world for its ornamental value and adaptability to different soil conditions."
