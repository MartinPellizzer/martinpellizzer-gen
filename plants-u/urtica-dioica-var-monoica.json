    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. monoica, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Urtica dioica var. monoica contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a tingling or burning sensation. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
