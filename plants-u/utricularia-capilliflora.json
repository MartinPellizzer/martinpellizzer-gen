    "intro": "Utricularia capilliflora, commonly known as the hairroot bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in marshes and shallow water bodies. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Utricularia capilliflora plays a role in nutrient cycling in its habitat by capturing and digesting microscopic organisms."
