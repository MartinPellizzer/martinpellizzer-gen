    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. vanhouttei, commonly known as the smooth-leaved elm, is a cultivar of the American elm. It is characterized by its smooth, light green leaves and a broad, spreading crown. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to certain diseases compared to other elm species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for urban landscapes. However, it is still susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which poses a threat to its survival."
