    "intro": "Uragoga monticola, commonly known as the mountain uragoga, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of its family. Uragoga monticola is often found in rocky or forested habitats at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
