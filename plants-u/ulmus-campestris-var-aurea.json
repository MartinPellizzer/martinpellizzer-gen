    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. aurea, commonly known as the golden elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a smooth margin and a bright yellow coloration that becomes more pronounced in the autumn. This tree prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for urban landscapes. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
