    "intro": "Ulmus angustifolia var. cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornubian field maple, is a variant of the narrow-leaf elm native to western Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that disperse by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional landscapes."
