    "intro": "Ulmus pubescens, commonly known as the downy elms, is a species of elm native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading canopy. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in landscaping and as a source of timber."
