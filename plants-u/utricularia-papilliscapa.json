    "intro": "Utricularia papilliscapa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it floats on the surface. Its leaves are often covered with fine, hair-like structures that aid in adhesion to substrates. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
