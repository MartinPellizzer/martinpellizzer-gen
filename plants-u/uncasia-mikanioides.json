It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in the early morning. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
