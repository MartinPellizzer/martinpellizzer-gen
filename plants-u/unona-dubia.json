    "intro": "Unona dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually small and strap-like, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms that bloom in the early morning. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Unona dubia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
