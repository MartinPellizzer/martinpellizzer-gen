    "intro": "Urginea noctiflora, commonly known as the night-flowering star of Bethlehem, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that open at night. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers emit a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract night-active pollinators such as moths. The plant is also known for its toxic properties, containing compounds that can be harmful if ingested."
