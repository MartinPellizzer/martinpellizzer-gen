    "intro": "Uromyrtus tenella, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in coastal environments. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds when dry, contributing to its propagation in harsh conditions. Uromyrtus tenella plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
