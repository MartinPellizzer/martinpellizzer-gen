    "intro": "Urtica mairei, commonly known as Maire's nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Urtica mairei produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects."
