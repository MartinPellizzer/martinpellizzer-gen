    "intro": "Uragoga melanochlora, commonly known as the black-chlorine fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Uragoga melanochlora plays a role in nutrient cycling in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying fern evolution."
