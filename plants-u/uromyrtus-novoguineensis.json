    "intro": "Uromyrtus novoguineensis, commonly known as the Guinean bottlebrush, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, resinous coating, which provides some protection against herbivores and environmental stress."
