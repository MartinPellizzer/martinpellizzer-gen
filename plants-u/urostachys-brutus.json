    "intro": "Urostachys brutus, commonly known as the mountain rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Urostachys brutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
