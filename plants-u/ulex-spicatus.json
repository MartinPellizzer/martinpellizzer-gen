    "intro": "Ulex spicatus, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelike inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in small, triangular pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds by spring winds. Ulex spicatus is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine."
