    "intro": "Urtica ardens, commonly known as the fiery nettle, is a species of stinging plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other nettle species known for their irritant hairs. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated edge, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Urtica ardens is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Like other nettles, it contains histamine and formic acid in its hairs, causing a painful reaction upon contact."
