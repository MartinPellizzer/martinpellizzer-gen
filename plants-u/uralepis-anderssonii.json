    "intro": "Uralepis anderssonii, commonly known as the Andes mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered along the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Uralepis anderssonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
