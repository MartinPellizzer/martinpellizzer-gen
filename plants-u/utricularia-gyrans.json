    "intro": "Utricularia gyrans, commonly known as the whirling bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to create a suction that captures small aquatic organisms. Utricularia gyrans is native to parts of Africa and is known for its unique morphology and efficient carnivorous adaptations."
