    "intro": "Urtica magellanica var. bracteata, commonly known as the Magellan nettle, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which release irritants upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to the plant's more prominent vegetative features."
