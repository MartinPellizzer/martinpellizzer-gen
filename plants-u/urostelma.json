    "intro": "Urostelma, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrive in warm, humid environments. Urostelma species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral morphology and ecological role in their native habitats."
