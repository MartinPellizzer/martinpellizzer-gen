    "intro": "Urostachys arcturi, commonly known as the Arctic saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Urostachys arcturi is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in extreme climates."
