    "intro": "Urtica lalibertadensis, commonly known as the Libertad nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and small greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces a painful sting from its hollow hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Urtica lalibertadensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various insects and small animals."
