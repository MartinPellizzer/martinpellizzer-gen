    "intro": "Urospatha marmorea, commonly known as the marble-stemmed bamboo, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pale green to white-veined stems that resemble marble, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as a clump-forming shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Urospatha marmorea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
