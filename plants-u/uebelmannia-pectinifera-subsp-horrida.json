    "intro": "Uebelmannia pectinifera subsp. horrida, commonly known as the Horrid Uebelmannia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, waxy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
