It is a deciduous tree that produces a unique fruit known as the fig, which is enclosed in a dense, fleshy husk. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, with the female trees producing the edible fruit. Uvifera dioica thrives in warm climates and is native to the Mediterranean region. Its botanical features include heart-shaped leaves and a milky sap that can cause skin irritation."
