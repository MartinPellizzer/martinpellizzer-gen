    "intro": "Utricularia costata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in ponds, ditches, or wetlands. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with three sepals and three petals. Utricularia costata plays an important ecological role by controlling algae and small invertebrate populations in its environment."
