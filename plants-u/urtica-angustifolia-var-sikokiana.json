    "intro": "Urtica angustifolia var. sikokiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant. This variant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
