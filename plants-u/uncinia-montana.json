    "intro": "Uncinia montana, commonly known as the mountain hookweed, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers bloom in late summer, producing tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Uncinia montana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and provides nectar for high-altitude pollinators."
