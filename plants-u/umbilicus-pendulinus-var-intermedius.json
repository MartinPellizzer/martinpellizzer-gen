    "intro": "Umbilicus pendulinus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate pendulant umbilic, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
