    "intro": "Ulex nanus f. remotus, commonly known as the remote dwarf bladdercamp, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
