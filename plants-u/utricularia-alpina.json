    "intro": "Utricularia alpina, commonly known as the Alpine bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to cold, aquatic environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, such as ponds and streams, where it can thrive by supplementing its nutrients through prey capture. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowers are often found at the water's surface. Utricularia alpina plays a unique ecological role in its habitat by contributing to the local food web and maintaining water quality through its predatory activity."
