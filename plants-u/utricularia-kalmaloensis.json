    "intro": "Utricularia kalmaloensis, commonly known as the Kalmalo bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant produces specialized bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrition. Its leaves are typically thin and floating, with the bladders embedded in the leaf tissue. Utricularia kalmaloensis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor environments."
