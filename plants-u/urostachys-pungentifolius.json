    "intro": "Urostachys pungentifolius, commonly known as the spiny leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments in Central Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine, prickly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils. Urostachys pungentifolius is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a hardy species in dry, sun-exposed areas."
