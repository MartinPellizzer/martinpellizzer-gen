    "intro": "Urophyllum streptopodium, commonly known as the spiral-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves around the stem. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Urophyllum streptopodium is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
