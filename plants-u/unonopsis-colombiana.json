    "intro": "Unonopsis colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian unonopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
