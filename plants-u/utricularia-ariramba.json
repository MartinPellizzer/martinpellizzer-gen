    "intro": "Utricularia ariramba, commonly known as the red bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia ariramba thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, relying on its carnivorous adaptations to supplement its nutrient intake."
