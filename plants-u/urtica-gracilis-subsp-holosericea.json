    "intro": "Urtica gracilis subsp. holosericea, commonly known as the silky stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems contain stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
