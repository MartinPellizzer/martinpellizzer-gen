    "intro": "Urostigma annulatum, commonly known as the ringed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, arranged in a whorl-like pattern. Urostigma annulatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
