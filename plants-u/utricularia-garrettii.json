    "intro": "Utricularia garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that bear tiny bladders used to trap and digest aquatic insects. This species thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, relying on its specialized structures for sustenance. The plant's stems are typically floating or submerged, with roots that anchor it in aquatic substrates. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in dense inflorescences."
