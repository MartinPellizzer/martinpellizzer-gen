    "intro": "Urostigma ampelos, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with dense, silvery foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright orange berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Its botanical features include hairy stems, glandular leaves, and a preference for well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Urostigma ampelos is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
