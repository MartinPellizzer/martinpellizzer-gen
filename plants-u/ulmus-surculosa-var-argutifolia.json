    "intro": "Ulmus surculosa var. argutifolia, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive serrated edge. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is well adapted to urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
