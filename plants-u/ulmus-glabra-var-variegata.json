    "intro": "Ulmus glabra var. variegata, commonly known as the white elm or variegated elm, is a variant of the American elm characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage. Its leaves are typically lighter in color, often displaying white or yellow margins, which set it apart from the standard green leaves of U. glabra. The tree has a tall, straight trunk with a broad, spreading crown, and its bark is smooth and gray in texture. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique appearance."
