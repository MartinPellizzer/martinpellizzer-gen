    "intro": "Utricularia sanguinea, commonly known as the blood bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are usually pink or red, adding to its ornamental appeal. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor conditions."
