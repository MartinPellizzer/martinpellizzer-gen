    "intro": "Uvaria macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed uvaria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to reveal small, edible seeds. Uvaria macrophylla is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest undergrowth."
