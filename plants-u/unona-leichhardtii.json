    "intro": "Unona leichhardtii, commonly known as the Leichhardt's ironwood, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that provides a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in clusters during the warmer months. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Unona leichhardtii is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
