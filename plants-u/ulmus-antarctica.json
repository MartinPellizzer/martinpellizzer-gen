    "intro": "Ulmus antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic elm, is a small deciduous tree native to the southernmost regions of the Earth. It is adapted to extreme cold and high-altitude environments, typically growing in the maritime Antarctic. The tree has a compact, rounded form with small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often developing shallow fissures with age. Ulmus antarctica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its harsh environment."
