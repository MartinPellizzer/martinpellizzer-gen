    "intro": "Utricularia strumosa, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and ponds. Its roots are often submerged, and it can grow in both aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or white in color."
