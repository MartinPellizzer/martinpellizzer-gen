    "intro": "Urena lappago var. glauca, commonly known as the blue morning glory, is a variant of the Urena lappago species, characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that open in the morning. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The blue coloration of its flowers is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which also contribute to its ornamental value."
