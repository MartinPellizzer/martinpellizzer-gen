It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its large, fleshy underground bulb. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical monsoon climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
