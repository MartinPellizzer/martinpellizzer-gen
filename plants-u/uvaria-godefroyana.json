    "intro": "Uvaria godefroyana, commonly known as the African star fruit or African custard apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically globose or ovoid in shape, with a smooth, leathery skin that turns from green to yellow or red as it ripens. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly velvety texture, while the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
