It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pale purple flowers that bloom at night. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its harsh, dry environment. Its bulbs are large and underground, serving as a storage organ for nutrients and moisture. Urginea multisetosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
