    "intro": "Urocarpus niveus, commonly known as the snow bladder, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Namibia and South Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, a feature common in many succulents. Urocarpus niveus is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, where it forms dense clusters."
