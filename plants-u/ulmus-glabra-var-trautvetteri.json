    "intro": "Ulmus glabra var. trautvetteri, commonly known as the Trautvetter's elm, is a variant of the Wych elm native to central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping growth habit and long, drooping branches. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth surface and a distinct yellow-green underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in the wild."
