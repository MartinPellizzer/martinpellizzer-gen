    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 vegeta, commonly known as the hybrid elm, is a cross between Ulmus minor and Ulmus laevis. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its tall, slender form and compound leaves with a serrated edge. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The hybrid elm is valued for its ornamental qualities and resistance to certain diseases compared to its parent species."
