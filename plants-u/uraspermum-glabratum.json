    "intro": "Uraspermum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth uraspermum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Uraspermum glabratum is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
