    "intro": "Urostachys neocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonia feather grass, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, typical of many grass family members. Urostachys neocaledonicus plays a minor role in the local ecosystem but is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche."
