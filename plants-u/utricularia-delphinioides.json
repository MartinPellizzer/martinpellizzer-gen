    "intro": "Utricularia delphinioides, commonly known as the water whorlwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant features delicate, branching stems covered in tiny bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are inflated with air and function as suction traps, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its environment. Utricularia delphinioides is often found in regions with stable water levels and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic conditions."
