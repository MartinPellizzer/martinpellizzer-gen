    "intro": "Umbilicus deflexus, commonly known as the drooping bellybutton plant, is a unique species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a coiled umbilical cord, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes that aid in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. The flowers are small and white, arranged in a dense, curling cluster that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
