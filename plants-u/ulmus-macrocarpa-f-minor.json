    "intro": "Ulmus macrocarpa f. minor, commonly known as the American slippery elm. It is a variant of the American elm, characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical species. The plant features smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin. It produces small, pendulous flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, fuzzy fruits. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
