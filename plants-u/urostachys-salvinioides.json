    "intro": "Urostachys salvinioides, commonly known as the Salvinia-like water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into two opposite lobes, resembling the structure of Salvinia species. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. Urostachys salvinioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
