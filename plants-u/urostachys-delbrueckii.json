    "intro": "Urostachys delbrueckii, commonly known as the Delbrueck's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Urostachys delbrueckii is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xerophytic gardens."
