    "intro": "Urobotrya congolana subsp. congolana, commonly known as the Congo sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its unique scent and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits containing smooth, black seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
