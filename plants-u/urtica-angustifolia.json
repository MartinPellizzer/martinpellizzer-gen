    "intro": "Urtica angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Urtica angustifolia has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its stinging hairs make handling the plant potentially irritating."
