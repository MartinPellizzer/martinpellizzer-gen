    "intro": "Ulmus major var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable elm, is a variant of the field elm native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broader and others more elongated, depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its bark is grey to brown, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to a range of temperate climates."
