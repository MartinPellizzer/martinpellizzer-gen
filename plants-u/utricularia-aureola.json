    "intro": "Utricularia aureola, commonly known as the golden bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves that form bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands, where it floats or grows submerged. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with distinctive spurred petals. Utricularia aureola is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
