    "intro": "Utricularia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typically found in freshwater environments. The plant has thin, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it float and absorb nutrients. Utricularia triflora is often found in still or slow-moving water, such as ponds and marshes. Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
