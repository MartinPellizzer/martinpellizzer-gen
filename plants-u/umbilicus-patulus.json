    "intro": "Umbilicus patulus, commonly known as the broad-umbilicated bladderwort, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are often small and may be submerged or floating, depending on the water conditions. Umbilicus patulus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
