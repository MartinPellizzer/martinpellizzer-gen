    "intro": "Urandra corniculata, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urandra corniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections worldwide."
