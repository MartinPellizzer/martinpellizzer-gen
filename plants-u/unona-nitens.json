    "intro": "Unona nitens, commonly known as the shining wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a luminous appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial light. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Unona nitens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
