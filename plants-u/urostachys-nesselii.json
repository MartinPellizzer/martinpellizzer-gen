It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has a succulent appearance with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure.
