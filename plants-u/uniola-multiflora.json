    "intro": "Uniola multiflora, commonly known as coastal wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand salt spray and wind. Uniola multiflora is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
