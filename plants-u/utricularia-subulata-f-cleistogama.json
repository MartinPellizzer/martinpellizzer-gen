    "intro": "Utricularia subulata f. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous slender bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, thread-like leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. This form is notable for producing cleistogamous flowers, which are closed and self-pollinated, enhancing reproductive success in its often unstable aquatic environment. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft substrates, such as ponds and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on carnivorous plant adaptations and reproductive strategies."
