    "intro": "Ulmus montana var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a cultivar of the wych elm characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. It is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant, drooping foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are heart-shaped and turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions."
