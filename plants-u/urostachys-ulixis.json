It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Urostachys ulixis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
