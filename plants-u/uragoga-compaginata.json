    "intro": "Uragoga compaginata, commonly known as the clouded orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, bi-colored petals that resemble a mosaic of white and purple, often with a subtle iridescence. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity and indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in the nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Uragoga compaginata is considered a conservation concern."
