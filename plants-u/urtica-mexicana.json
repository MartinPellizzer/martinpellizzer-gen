It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating sap when touched. Urtica mexicana typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
