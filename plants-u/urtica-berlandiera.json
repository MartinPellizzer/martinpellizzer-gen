    "intro": "Urtica berlandiera, commonly known as desert nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact, similar to other members of the Urtica genus. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with its deep root system and ability to store water."
