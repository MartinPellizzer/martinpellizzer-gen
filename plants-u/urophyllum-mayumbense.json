    "intro": "Urophyllum mayumbense, commonly known as the Mayumbense orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinct lip that is often darker. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
