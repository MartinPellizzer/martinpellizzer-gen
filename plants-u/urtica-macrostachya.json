    "intro": "Urtica macrostachya, commonly known as the giant nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, upright spikes. Its leaves are broadly ovate with serrated edges and a hairy texture. Urtica macrostachya is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
