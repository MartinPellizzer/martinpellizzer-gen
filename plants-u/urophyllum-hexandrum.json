    "intro": "Urophyllum hexandrum, commonly known as the six-toothed cup-plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are dry, two-lobed schizocarps that disperse via wind, contributing to its natural range. Urophyllum hexandrum thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
