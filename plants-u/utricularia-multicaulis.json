    "intro": "Utricularia multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments, often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to create a suction that captures tiny aquatic organisms. Utricularia multicaulis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
