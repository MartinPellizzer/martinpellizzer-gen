    "intro": "Unonopsis riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's unon, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. It is typically found in shaded, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
