    "intro": "Umbilicus rupestris var. truncatus, commonly known as the rock umbilicus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, spiky leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its unique form and resilience, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
