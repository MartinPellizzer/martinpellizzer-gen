    "intro": "Ulmus campestris lusus major, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. However, it is susceptible to several diseases, including Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
