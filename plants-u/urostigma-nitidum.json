    "intro": "Urostigma nitidum, commonly known as the glossy bladder nut, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small shrub that typically grows up to 1.5 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive bladder-like fruits that are yellowish-green when mature and contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying tropical flora."
