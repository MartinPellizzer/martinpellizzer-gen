    "intro": "Ulmus castaneifolia, commonly known as the Persian elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5-9 lobed and have a distinctive castanea-like appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks. The bark is smooth when young but becomes deeply furrowed with age, giving it a rugged appearance."
