    "intro": "Urtica tomentosa, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains fine hairs that release irritating chemicals, causing a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. Urtica tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and wetlands. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
