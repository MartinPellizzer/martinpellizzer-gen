    "intro": "Utricularia chiribiquetensis, commonly known as the Chiribiquet bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on capturing small aquatic organisms for nutrients. Its leaves are finely divided, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Utricularia chiribiquetensis is an example of a specialized carnivorous plant adapted to its unique ecological niche."
