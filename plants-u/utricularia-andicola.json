    "intro": "Utricularia andicola, commonly known as the Andean bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged environments such as marshes and peat bogs. The plant is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its roots are often submerged, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Utricularia andicola plays a unique ecological role in its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems."
