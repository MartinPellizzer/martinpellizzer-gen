    "intro": "Ulmus pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Ulmus pendula prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for parks and gardens."
