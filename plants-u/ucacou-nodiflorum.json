    "intro": "Ucacou nodiflorum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and is highly valued for its aesthetic and acoustic properties. The plant has compound leaves with small, opposite leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
