    "intro": "Urechites luteus, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its yellowish-green coloration is due to the presence of chlorophyll and other pigments. Urechites luteus is often found in regions with temperate climates and is adapted to low-light conditions."
