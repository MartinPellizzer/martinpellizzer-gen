    "intro": "Ulmus procera f. marginata, commonly known as the silver elm, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its striking white to pale green variegated leaves. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are elongated, with a serrated margin, and often display a distinctive pattern of creamy-white to pale green markings. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compact growth habit. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions."
