    "intro": "Utricularia leptoplectra, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture small aquatic organisms. These utricles are usually less than 1 millimeter in size and are used to trap prey such as water fleas and protozoa. Utricularia leptoplectra is often found in muddy or sandy substrates and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
