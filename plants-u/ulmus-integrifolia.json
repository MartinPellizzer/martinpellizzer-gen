    "intro": "Ulmus integrifolia, commonly known as the western slippery elm, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are entire, giving it its scientific name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streams."
