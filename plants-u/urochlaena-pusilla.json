    "intro": "Urochlaena pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sandverbena, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale blue or purple in color. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water availability. Urochlaena pusilla plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
