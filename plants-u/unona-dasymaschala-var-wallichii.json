    "intro": "Unona dasymaschala var. wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan blue poplar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which is due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at higher altitudes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
