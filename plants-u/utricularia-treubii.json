    "intro": "Utricularia treubii, commonly known as the Treub's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia treubii is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in environments where other plants struggle to obtain nutrients."
