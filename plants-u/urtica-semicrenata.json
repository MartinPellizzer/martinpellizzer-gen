    "intro": "Urtica semicrenata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash in humans. The plant has heart-shaped or oval leaves with serrated edges and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Urtica semicrenata is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
