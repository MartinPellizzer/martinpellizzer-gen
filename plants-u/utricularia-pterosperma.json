    "intro": "Utricularia pterosperma, commonly known as the flying hen or the water whorl, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant features delicate, floating leaves with specialized bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders function as suction traps, allowing the plant to absorb nutrients from its prey. Utricularia pterosperma is native to parts of Africa and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas."
