It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its unique floral structures and milky sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia, a feature typical of the spurge family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urostachys killipii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
