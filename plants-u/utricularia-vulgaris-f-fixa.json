    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris f. fixa, commonly known as the fixed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on its prey for essential nutrients. The plant has slender, branching stems with whorled leaves, and its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands."
