    "intro": "Unamia alba, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Unamia alba is often found in dry slopes, desert scrub, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
