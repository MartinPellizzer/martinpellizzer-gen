    "intro": "Utricularia riccioides, commonly known as the Riccioides bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This plant typically grows in wetland or aquatic environments, where it floats on the surface of still or slow-moving water. Its roots are often submerged, and it relies on photosynthesis for energy while supplementing its nutrient intake through captured prey. Utricularia riccioides is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions."
