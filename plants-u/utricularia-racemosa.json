    "intro": "Utricularia racemosa, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it relies on its prey for essential nutrients. Its roots are often submerged, and it produces delicate, whorled leaves that support the bladders. Utricularia racemosa is widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to various aquatic environments."
