It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive spiny seed pods and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its characteristic long, spiky pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature of this variety."
