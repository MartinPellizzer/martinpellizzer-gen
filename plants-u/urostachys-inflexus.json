    "intro": "Urostachys inflexus, commonly known as the bent-stem sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Urostachys inflexus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
