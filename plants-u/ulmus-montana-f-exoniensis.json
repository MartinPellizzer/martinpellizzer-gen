    "intro": "Ulmus montana f. exoniensis, commonly known as the Exeter elm, is a rare and ancient variant of the wych elm. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and often gnarled growth habit, which gives it a striking appearance. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a rough upper surface and a lighter green underside. This cultivar is highly valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance, often found in old gardens and landscapes. Due to its rarity and susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it is considered a conservation priority."
