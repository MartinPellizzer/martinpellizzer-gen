    "intro": "Uragoga floribunda, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of bell-shaped, yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. Uragoga floribunda thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardens."
