    "intro": "Uva-ursi pulchella, commonly known as the showy bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly waxy in texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Uva-ursi pulchella is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
