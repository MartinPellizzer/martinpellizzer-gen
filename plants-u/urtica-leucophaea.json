    "intro": "Urtica leucophaea, commonly known as the white stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs on both the stems and leaves, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and a dense covering of fine hairs. Urtica leucophaea is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
