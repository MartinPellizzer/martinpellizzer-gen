    "intro": "Urera gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and high demand for its wood, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats."
