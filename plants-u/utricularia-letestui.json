    "intro": "Utricularia letestui, commonly known as the Letestu's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are typically less than 1 millimeter in size, and they function through a suction mechanism triggered by water movement. Utricularia letestui is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microfauna populations."
