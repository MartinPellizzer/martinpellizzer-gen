It is a perennial shrub characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to red, depending on the species. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Urobotrya trinervia is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its stems and leaves."
