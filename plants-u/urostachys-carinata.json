    "intro": "Urostachys carinata, commonly known as the mountain grass or spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette. Urostachys carinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in arid landscapes."
