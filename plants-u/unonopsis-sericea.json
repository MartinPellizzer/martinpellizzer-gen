It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
