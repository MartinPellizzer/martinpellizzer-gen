It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Its leaves are large and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, while its flowers are showy and come in shades of pink and white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
