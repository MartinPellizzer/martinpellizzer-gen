    "intro": "Utricularia sclerocarpa, commonly known as the hard-shelled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, floating bladders that function as trap-like structures to capture microscopic organisms. Its roots are often anchored in submerged substrates, and it produces small, white or pale flowers. Utricularia sclerocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microbial populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
