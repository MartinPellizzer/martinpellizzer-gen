    "intro": "Utricularia limmenensis, commonly known as the Limmen bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are a defining feature of the genus Utricularia. This species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually simple and floating, with the bladders attached to the leaf nodes. The plant is native to Australia and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor waters."
