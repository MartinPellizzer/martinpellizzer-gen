    "intro": "Uragoga turrialvensis, commonly known as the Turrialva orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found in the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Uragoga turrialvensis is considered a vulnerable species."
