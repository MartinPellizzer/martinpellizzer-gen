    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. vulgaris, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spreading crown and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
