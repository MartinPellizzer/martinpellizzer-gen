    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its harsh coastal environment. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous stems, contrasting with the more hairy stems of the typical variety. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats."
