    "intro": "Urera platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited urera, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
