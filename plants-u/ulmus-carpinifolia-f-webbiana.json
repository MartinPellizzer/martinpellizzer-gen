    "intro": "Ulmus carpinifolia f. webbiana, commonly known as the Webbian field maple, is a rare and distinct form of the field maple. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural collections."
