It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is extensive and helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Uralepis virens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
