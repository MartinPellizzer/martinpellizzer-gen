    "intro": "Urtica virulenta, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant contains toxic chemical compounds called histamine and acetylcholine, which cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica virulenta produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Despite its defensive properties, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
