    "intro": "Uniola paniculata, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, pale flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and pine flatwoods. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Wiregrass plays an important ecological role in maintaining the health of its native habitats."
