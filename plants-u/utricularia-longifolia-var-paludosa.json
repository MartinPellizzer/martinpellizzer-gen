    "intro": "Utricularia longifolia var. paludosa, commonly known as the bog bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, often found in slow-moving water or damp soil. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters along the stems. This variant is distinguished by its elongated leaves and adaptation to boggy conditions, making it a unique example of carnivorous flora in temperate regions."
