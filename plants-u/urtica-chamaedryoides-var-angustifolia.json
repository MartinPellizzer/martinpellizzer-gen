    "intro": "Urtica chamaedryoides var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves with a dense covering of fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and disturbed soils."
