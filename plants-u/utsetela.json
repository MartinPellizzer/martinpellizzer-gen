It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that resemble those of the iris. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Utsetela has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate blooms that are often clustered at the top of the stem. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
