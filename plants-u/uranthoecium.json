    "intro": "Uranthoecium, commonly known as the stamen. It is the male reproductive organ of flowering plants, consisting of a filament and an anther. The anther produces and releases pollen grains, which contain the male gametes. The filament supports the anther and helps in positioning it for pollination. The uranthoecium plays a crucial role in the reproductive process of angiosperms."
