    "intro": "Urochloa pubescens, commonly known as hairy buffalo grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and pubescent (hairy) surfaces, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a fibrous structure, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in erosion control and forage production. Urochloa pubescens is also valued for its ability to thrive in full sun and withstand drought conditions."
