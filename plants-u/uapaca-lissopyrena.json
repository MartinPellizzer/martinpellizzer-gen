    "intro": "Uapaca lissopyrena, commonly known as the smooth-leaved kola nut tree, is a species native to eastern Africa. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody capsules containing the edible kola nuts. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it has a shallow root system that helps it thrive in tropical forest environments. The plant is valued for its nuts, which are used in traditional ceremonies and as a stimulant."
