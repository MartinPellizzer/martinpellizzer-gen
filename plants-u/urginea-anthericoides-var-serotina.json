    "intro": "Urginea anthericoides var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering African giant lily, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome and broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate to flourish. This variant is particularly noted for its delayed flowering compared to other members of the Urginea genus."
