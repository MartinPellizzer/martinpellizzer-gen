    "intro": "Urostachys mandiocanus var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian arrowroot, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while the roots are the primary part used for culinary purposes. This variety is valued for its starchy roots, which are used in traditional cooking and as a food source in certain regions."
