    "intro": "Unciferia wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, ghostly white petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
