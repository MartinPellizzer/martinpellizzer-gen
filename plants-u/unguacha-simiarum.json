    "intro": "Unguacha simiarum, commonly known as the monkey orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble the faces of monkeys, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers bloom during the wet season and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
