    "intro": "Urananthus pallidus, commonly known as the pale urananthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cooler, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
