    "intro": "Urtica chesneyana, commonly known as Chesney's nettle, is a flowering plant species native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its stinging hairs, like those of other nettle species, can cause skin irritation upon contact."
