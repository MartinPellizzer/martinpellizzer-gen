    "intro": "Ulmus americana f. laevior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved American elm, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its smoother, less hairy leaves compared to the typical species. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth margin and a lighter green underside. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and resistance to certain diseases. However, it is still susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in the wild."
