    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 multidentata, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Chinese elm (U. parvifolia) and the American elm (U. americana). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin with fine teeth, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types, making it a popular choice in urban landscaping."
