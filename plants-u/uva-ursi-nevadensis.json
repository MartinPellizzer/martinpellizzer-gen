It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces red berries that are adapted to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. It is well-suited to rocky soils and can tolerate cold temperatures and poor nutrient conditions. Uva-ursi nevadensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
