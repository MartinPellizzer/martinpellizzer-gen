    "intro": "Uragoga schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environments. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce conditions."
