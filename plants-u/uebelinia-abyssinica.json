    "intro": "Uebelinia abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian thornapple, is a flowering plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological role and medicinal uses, it is of interest to botanists and local communities."
