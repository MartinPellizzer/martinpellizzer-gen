    "intro": "Urelytrum humbertianum, commonly known as the Humbert's bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are aerial and have a distinctive two-lipped structure. Urelytrum humbertianum is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey."
