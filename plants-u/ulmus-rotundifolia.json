    "intro": "Ulmus rotundifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other elm species. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish in youth, becoming fissured with age. Ulmus rotundifolia is relatively resistant to Dutch elm disease compared to other elm species."
