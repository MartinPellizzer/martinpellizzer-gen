It features large, fleshy bulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, erect stems with narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, arranged in umbels, and bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is adapted to coastal environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils."
