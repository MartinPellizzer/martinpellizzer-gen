    "intro": "Utricularia geminiscapa, commonly known as the twin-stalked bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrients. These bladders are triggered by water currents or physical contact. Utricularia geminiscapa is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is known for its rapid growth and unique adaptation to its environment."
