    "intro": "Uleiorchis longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, gracefully curved stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in the undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in the rich, organic soil of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
