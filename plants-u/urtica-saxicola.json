    "intro": "Urtica saxicola, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hairy, stinging leaves and small, greenish flowers that grow in clusters. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal environments. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces capsules that contain tiny seeds. Urtica saxicola plays a role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for certain insects and animals."
