It is a shrub characterized by its spiny stems and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces large, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening and as a hedge plant."
