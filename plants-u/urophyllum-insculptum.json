    "intro": "Urophyllum insculptum, commonly known as the carved leaf plant, is a rare flowering species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, intricately veined leaves that resemble carved patterns, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the late spring and early summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Urophyllum insculptum is considered a conservation concern."
