It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, with prominent longitudinal veins. Uncinia sulcata is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance."
