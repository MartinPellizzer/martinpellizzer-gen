It is native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in moist, temperate forest environments. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind."
