    "intro": "Urtica fissa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its serrated, heart-shaped leaves and fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating substance when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, appearing in clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Urtica fissa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
