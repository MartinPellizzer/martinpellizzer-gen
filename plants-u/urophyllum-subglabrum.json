    "intro": "Urophyllum subglabrum, commonly known as the smoothleaf urophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright stems covered in smooth, glabrous foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to yellow in color, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Urophyllum subglabrum is often found in grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
