    "intro": "Urginea undulata var. tazensis, commonly known as the Tazanian bulbous plant, is a variant of the genus Urginea native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, fleshy bulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, often fragrant scent. This variety is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
