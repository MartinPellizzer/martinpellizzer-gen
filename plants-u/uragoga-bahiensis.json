    "intro": "Uragoga bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia uragoga, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the coastal regions of northeastern Brazil. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, characterized by its woody stems and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along the shoreline, adapting to the harsh coastal environment with its salt-tolerant properties. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
