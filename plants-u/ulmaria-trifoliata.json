    "intro": "Ulmaria trifoliata, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, licorice-scented seed pod that matures in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Ulmaria trifoliata is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
