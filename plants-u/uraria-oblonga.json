    "intro": "Uraria oblonga, commonly known as Indian burr or wild senna, is a flowering plant native to South Asia. It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Uraria oblonga is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry regions. It also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
