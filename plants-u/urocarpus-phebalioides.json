    "intro": "Urocarpus phebalioides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, enabling it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. Urocarpus phebalioides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
