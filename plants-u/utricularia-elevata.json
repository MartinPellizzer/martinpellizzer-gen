    "intro": "Utricularia elevata, commonly known as the aerial bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its lack of true roots and its ability to grow in wet soil or waterlogged environments. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps for tiny aquatic organisms. These utricles are typically found on the stems and leaves, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients through carnivory. Utricularia elevata is often found in marshes, ponds, and other moist habitats where it can thrive without soil."
