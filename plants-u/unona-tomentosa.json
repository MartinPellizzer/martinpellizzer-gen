    "intro": "Unona tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its gray, peeling bark and large, heart-shaped leaves with a fuzzy underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by orange to red berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Unona tomentosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
