    "intro": "Urostachys chamaepeuce var. urbanianus, commonly known as the urban stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to rocky soils in arid regions. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and easy-to-maintain ornamental plant."
