    "intro": "Unciferia bifalcis, commonly known as the two-headed fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive bifurcated fronds that split into two separate branches, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Unciferia bifalcis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic organisms."
