    "intro": "Utricularia affinis f. albida, commonly known as the white bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap aquatic invertebrates for nutrition. This variety is distinguished by its pale or white coloration, which sets it apart from other forms of Utricularia affinis. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. The plant's morphology includes delicate stems and leaves, with the bladders being the most notable feature for its predatory behavior."
