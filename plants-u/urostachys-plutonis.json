    "intro": "Urostachys plutonis, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, pale green to blue-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in late summer, producing tiny, three-lobed capsules. Urostachys plutonis is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance."
