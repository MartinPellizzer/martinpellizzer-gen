    "intro": "Uniola uniflora, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Uniola uniflora is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
