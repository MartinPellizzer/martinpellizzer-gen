    "intro": "Uvaria sanyaensis, commonly known as the Sanya uvaria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
