    "intro": "Urceodiscus scabridulus, commonly known as the roughcup, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small, clustered flowers. The plant features narrow, linear leaves covered in a rough, sandpaper-like texture, which gives it its common name. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Urceodiscus scabridulus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
