    "intro": "Utricularia pachyceras, commonly known as the giant bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. Native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters. Its leaves are typically whorled and bear the specialized bladders that function as passive traps. Utricularia pachyceras is often found in dense mats, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its aquatic environment."
