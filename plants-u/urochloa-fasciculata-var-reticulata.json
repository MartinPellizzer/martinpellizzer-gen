    "intro": "Urochloa fasciculata var. reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined blady grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often inconspicuous compared to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its fibrous roots and dense growth make it a valuable forage plant in some agricultural systems."
