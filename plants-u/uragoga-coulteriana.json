    "intro": "Uragoga coulteriana, commonly known as the Coulter's uragoga, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its distinctive morphology. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem with a crown of pinnate leaves that are often adorned with spines. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in inflorescences, and it produces dark, fleshy berries as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
