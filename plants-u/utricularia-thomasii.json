    "intro": "Utricularia thomasii, commonly known as the Thomas's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant produces specialized bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms, providing it with essential nutrients. Its leaves are typically thin and floating, with the bladders embedded in the leaf tissue. Utricularia thomasii is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
