    "intro": "Urostigma amazonicum, commonly known as the Amazonian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Urostigma amazonicum is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in supporting local ecosystems. Its latex sap contains milky substances that can be toxic to some animals."
