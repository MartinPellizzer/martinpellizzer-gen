    "intro": "Uragoga carronis, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which reflects sunlight and helps it thrive in cooler, drier environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale blue, typically blooming during the spring season. Uragoga carronis is a perennial herb that prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
