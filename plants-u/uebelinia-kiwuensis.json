    "intro": "Uebelinia kiwuensis, commonly known as the African mountain bean, is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and overharvesting."
