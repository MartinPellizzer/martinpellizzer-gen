    "intro": "Utricularia rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, floating bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, with specialized glands that secrete digestive enzymes. Utricularia rosulata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters."
