    "intro": "Urostachya merapiensis, commonly known as the Merapi spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat. Urostachya merapiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
