    "intro": "Utricularia aurea f. immaculata, commonly known as the immaculate yellow bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the water surface. Its flowers are usually yellow, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. The varietal form 'immaculata' is distinguished by its lack of the typical dark markings found on the leaves of the typical form."
