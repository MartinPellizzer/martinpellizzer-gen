    "intro": "Utania volubilis var. microcalyx, commonly known as the small-fruited morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the morning. The flowers are typically pale blue or purple and are followed by small, round fruits. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardens."
