    "intro": "Uncaria bernaysii, commonly known as the climbing cat's claw, is a woody vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its roots and stems contain alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is important to note that the plant is toxic and should not be used without proper guidance."
