It is characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in dense clusters, which are often arranged in two rows along the stem. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Urochloa distachyos is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop in some regions."
