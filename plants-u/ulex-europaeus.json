    "intro": "Ulex europaeus, commonly known as the common furze or goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, spherical fruits called \"pomes\" that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, edible pulp. Ulex europaeus is adapted to poor, dry soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient species within its native range."
