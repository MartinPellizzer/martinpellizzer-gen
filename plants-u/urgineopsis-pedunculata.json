    "intro": "Urgineopsis pedunculata, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive central crown. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Urgineopsis pedunculata plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
