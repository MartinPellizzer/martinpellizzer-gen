    "intro": "Uncinia riparia var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that produce numerous small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its stoloniferous growth allows it to spread and colonize open, disturbed areas effectively."
