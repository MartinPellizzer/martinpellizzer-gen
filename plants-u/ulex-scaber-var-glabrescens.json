It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which become less prominent as the plant matures. Ulex scaber var. glabrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and distinctive appearance."
