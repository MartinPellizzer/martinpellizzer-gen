    "intro": "Ulmus aurea, commonly known as the golden elm, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves that turn a vibrant orange-red in the fall. The tree has a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. Ulmus aurea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and parks for its visual appeal."
