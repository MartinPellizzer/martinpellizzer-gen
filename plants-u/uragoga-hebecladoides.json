    "intro": "Uragoga hebecladoides, commonly known as the coastal hebe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, a characteristic adaptation to minimize water loss. Uragoga hebecladoides is often found growing on rocky outcrops near the coast, where it is exposed to strong winds and salt spray."
