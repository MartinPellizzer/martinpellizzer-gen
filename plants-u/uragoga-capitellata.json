    "intro": "Uragoga capitellata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal flats. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. Uragoga capitellata plays a role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
