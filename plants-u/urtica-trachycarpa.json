    "intro": "Urtica trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and hollow, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits. Urtica trachycarpa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
