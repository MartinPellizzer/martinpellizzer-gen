It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that mature in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Ulmus elongata is also valued for its relatively fast growth and adaptability to urban environments."
