    "intro": "Uragoga heterocephala, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
