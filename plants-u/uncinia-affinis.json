    "intro": "Uncinia affinis, commonly known as the hooked bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving water and has thin, branching stems. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The botanical features of Uncinia affinis are adapted for both aquatic life and nutrient acquisition through carnivory."
