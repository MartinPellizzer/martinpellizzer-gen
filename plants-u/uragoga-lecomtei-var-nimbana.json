    "intro": "Uragoga lecomtei var. nimbana, commonly known as the Nimbana orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapting to its climbing habit and moisture retention needs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
