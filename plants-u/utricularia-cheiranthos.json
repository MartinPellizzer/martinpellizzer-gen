    "intro": "Utricularia cheiranthos, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, water-filled bladders that function as traps to capture small aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and floating, while the stems are often branched and submerged. Utricularia cheiranthos plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
