    "intro": "Utricularia tetraloba, commonly known as the four-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture microscopic aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are slender and often form dense mats on the water surface. Utricularia tetraloba is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
