    "intro": "Urocarpus grandiflorus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with thick, fleshy stems and hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that disperse seeds via the wind. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture in dry environments. Urocarpus grandiflorus plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
