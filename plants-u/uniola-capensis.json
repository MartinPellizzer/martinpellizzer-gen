    "intro": "Uniola capensis, commonly known as coastal grass or Cape grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
