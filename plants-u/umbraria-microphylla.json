It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, often blooming in the evening. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded environments. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
