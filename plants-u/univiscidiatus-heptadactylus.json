It features a compact rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green and purple. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, arranged in a tight cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
