    "intro": "Urtica rugosa, commonly known as rough nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica rugosa contains stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact, a common feature among plants in the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
