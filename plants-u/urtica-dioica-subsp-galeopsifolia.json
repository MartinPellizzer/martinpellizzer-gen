    "intro": "Urtica dioica subsp. galeopsifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of tiny stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spherical clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
