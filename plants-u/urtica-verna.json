    "intro": "Urtica verna, commonly known as spring nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a painful rash upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Urtica verna is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
