    "intro": "Utricularia brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stem bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. Its stems are short and often branched, with small, scale-like leaves. Utricularia brachypoda is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
