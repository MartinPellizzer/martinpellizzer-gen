    "intro": "Ulmus carpinifolia var. horsholmii, commonly known as the Horsholm elm, is a rare and ancient variety of elm native to Denmark. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree has a distinctive, gnarled trunk and often exhibits a twisted growth habit. It is valued for its historical significance and is considered a relic of the past. Due to its rarity and susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it is a subject of conservation interest."
