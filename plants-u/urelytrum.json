    "intro": "Urelytrum, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day. Urelytrum species typically have a submerged root system and produce rhizomes that anchor them in shallow water. Their leaves are usually covered in a waxy cuticle that helps repel water, while their flowers are pollinated by insects. Urelytrum plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
