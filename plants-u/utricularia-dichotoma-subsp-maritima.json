    "intro": "Utricularia dichotoma subsp. maritima, commonly known as the salt marsh bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to coastal areas. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in brackish or saline water, adapting to high salinity environments. Its leaves are slender and often form a rosette, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. This subspecies plays a role in nutrient cycling in its aquatic habitat."
