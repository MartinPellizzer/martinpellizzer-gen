    "intro": "Utricularia longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. Native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia, it thrives in still or slow-moving water. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
