It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, succulent leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Uralepis fusca plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
