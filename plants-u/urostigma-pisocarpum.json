    "intro": "Urostigma pisocarpum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
