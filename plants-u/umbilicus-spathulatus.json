    "intro": "Umbilicus spathulatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf umbrella plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like inflorescence, which consists of a spathaceous bract enclosing a cluster of small white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Umbilicus spathulatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
