It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water, where it relies on its specialized structures for sustenance. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which aid in capturing prey. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse aquatic environments."
