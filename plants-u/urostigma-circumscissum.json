    "intro": "Urostigma circumscissum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale green in color. It is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops if left unchecked."
