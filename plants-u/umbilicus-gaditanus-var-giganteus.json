    "intro": "Umbilicus gaditanus var. giganteus, commonly known as the giant umbilicaria, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Umbilicariaceae and is distinguished by its large, plate-like thallus that can reach several centimeters in diameter. The lichen's structure consists of a central umbilicate (central pit) surrounded by a rim, which is a key feature of the genus Umbilicaria. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically on decaying wood or rock surfaces. This variant is notable for its robust growth and is often found in Mediterranean regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological balance."
