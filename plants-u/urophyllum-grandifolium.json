    "intro": "Urophyllum grandifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf urophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its foliage and floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a potential ornamental plant."
