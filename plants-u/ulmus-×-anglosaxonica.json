    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 anglosaxonica, commonly known as the Wych Elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English Elm (Ulmus procera) and the Wych Elm (Ulmus wilsonii). It is a deciduous tree native to Europe, characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, spreading crown. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, spherical samaras that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural propagation. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in European landscapes."
