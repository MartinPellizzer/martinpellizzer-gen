    "intro": "Urbinella palmeri, commonly known as the desert star or desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy, gray-green foliage adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Urbinella palmeri is well-suited to xeriscaping and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
