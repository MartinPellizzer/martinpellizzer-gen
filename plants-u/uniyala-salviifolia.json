    "intro": "Uniyala salviifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge, typically ranging from 5 to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
