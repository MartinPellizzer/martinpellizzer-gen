The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its unique botanical characteristics. Urophyllum glaucescens is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun."
