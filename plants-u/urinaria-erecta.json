    "intro": "Urinaria erecta, commonly known as the upright urinaria, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions. Urinaria erecta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
