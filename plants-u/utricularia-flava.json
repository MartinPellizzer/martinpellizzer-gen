    "intro": "Utricularia flava, commonly known as the yellow bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that contain bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This aquatic plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Utricularia flava plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling small invertebrate populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
