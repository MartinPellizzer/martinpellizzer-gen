    "intro": "Urtica serpyllacea, commonly known as common ground-ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with scalloped edges and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant has stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along woodland edges. Its creeping growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a valuable ground cover in certain ecological contexts."
