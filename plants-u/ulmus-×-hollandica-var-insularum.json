    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica var. insularum, commonly known as the Island elm, is a hybrid species native to the British Isles. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The bark is grey and fissured, becoming smoother with age, while the foliage is typically a deep green in summer. It produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience to urban conditions."
