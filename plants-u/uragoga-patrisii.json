    "intro": "Uragoga patrisii, commonly known as the Patrisii's uragoga, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that exhibit a striking iridescence under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the wet season, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga patrisii is considered a species of conservation concern."
