It features large, waxy, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem and produces large, showy bracts that surround the flowers. Its bulbs are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Urginea johnstonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with well-drained soil."
