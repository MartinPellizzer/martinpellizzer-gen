    "intro": "Umbilicus rupestris var. velenovskyi, commonly known as the Velenovsky's rock umbel, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and distinctive umbel-shaped inflorescences that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are usually covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
