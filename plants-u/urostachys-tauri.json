    "intro": "Urostachys tauri, commonly known as the Tauric sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous and coastal areas. Its adaptations include succulent leaves that store water and a compact growth form to reduce water loss. Urostachys tauri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
