    "intro": "Urtica baccifera, commonly known as the stinging nettle or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which release irritants when touched. The plant is native to parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its small greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Urtica baccifera is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
