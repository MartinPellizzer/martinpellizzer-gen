It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
