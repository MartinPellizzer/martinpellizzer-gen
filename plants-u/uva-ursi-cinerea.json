    "intro": "Uva-ursi cinerea, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically reddish or dark green, and it produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its bright red berries that ripen in late summer, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Uva-ursi cinerea is often found in acidic soils, such as those in heathlands and boreal forests, and it has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine."
