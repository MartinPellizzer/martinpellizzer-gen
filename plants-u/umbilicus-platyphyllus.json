    "intro": "Umbilicus platyphyllus, commonly known as the flat-leaf umbilicus, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive umbilicated (belly-button-like) structure at the base of its leaves. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, adding a subtle contrast to its foliage. It is native to specific regions with well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
