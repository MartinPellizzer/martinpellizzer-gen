    "intro": "Ulex canescens, commonly known as the common furze, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps enrich the soil. Ulex canescens is often found in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and woodland edges. Its hardy nature makes it a common component of coastal and sandy soils."
