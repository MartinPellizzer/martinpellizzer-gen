    "intro": "Utania peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Utania, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late spring and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Utania peninsularis is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
