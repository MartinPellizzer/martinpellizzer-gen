    "intro": "Utricularia buntingiana, commonly known as the Bunting's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features specialized bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its environment. Utricularia buntingiana is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
