It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant's stems are flexible and can twine around supporting structures, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains several seeds. Uragoga erratica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush foliage and delicate blooms."
