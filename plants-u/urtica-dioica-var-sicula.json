    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. sicula, commonly known as Sicilian nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle plant native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hollow, smooth stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. The leaves and young stems are edible when cooked and have been used in traditional cuisines and herbal medicine."
