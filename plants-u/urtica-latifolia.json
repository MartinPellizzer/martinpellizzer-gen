    "intro": "Urtica latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense covering of stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica latifolia thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
