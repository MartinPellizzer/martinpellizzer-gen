    "intro": "Urophyllum biloculare, commonly known as the two-celled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially emergent. Urophyllum biloculare is known for its unique method of nutrient acquisition through prey capture, which compensates for the nutrient-poor environments in which it thrives."
