    "intro": "Uragoga bracteolata, commonly known as the bracteolata mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds. Uragoga bracteolata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid environments."
