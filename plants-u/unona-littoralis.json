    "intro": "Unona littoralis, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, star-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid coastal conditions. Unona littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
