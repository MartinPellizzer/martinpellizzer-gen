    "intro": "Urginea maritima var. tadlaensis, commonly known as the Tadla sea onion, is a variant of the sea onion plant native to coastal regions of North Africa. It is a bulbous plant characterized by its large, fleshy underground bulbs and strap-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal environments, it is considered an important species for ecological studies in arid and semi-arid regions."
