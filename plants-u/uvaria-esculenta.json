    "intro": "Uvaria esculenta, commonly known as the wild durian, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits that are typically harvested when ripe, though they are not as well-known as the cultivated durian. Its botanical features include a smooth, woody stem and small, clustered fruits that can grow up to 10 centimeters in diameter. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
