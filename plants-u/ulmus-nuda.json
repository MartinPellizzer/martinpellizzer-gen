    "intro": "Ulmus nuda, commonly known as the naked elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and long, drooping branches that create a distinctive, weeping appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by samaras, which are winged seeds dispersed by wind. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests."
