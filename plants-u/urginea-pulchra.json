    "intro": "Urginea pulchra, commonly known as the giant purple lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Cape region of South Africa. It features large, showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem and produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It is adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its underground bulb. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires well-drained soil and minimal watering."
