    "intro": "Urtica dioica f. ramosa, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely serrated leaves and dense clusters of small, greenish flowers. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant is notable for its stinging hairs, which contain irritants that cause a skin reaction upon contact. It thrives in moist, nitrogen-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. Urtica dioica f. ramosa is also valued for its nutritional content and traditional medicinal uses."
