    "intro": "Utricularia inflexa var. stellaris, commonly known as the star bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This variant is native to tropical regions and thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. The plant's unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
