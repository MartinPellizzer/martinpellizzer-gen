    "intro": "Ulmus nana, commonly known as the dwarf elm, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring a compact, rounded form with dense foliage. The leaves are heart-shaped, rough to the touch, and turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, clustered flowers in early spring. This plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
