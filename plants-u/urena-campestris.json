    "intro": "Urena campestris, commonly known as field urena, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 1 to 2 meters tall, characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, followed by spherical, hairy seed pods. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields. Urena campestris is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
