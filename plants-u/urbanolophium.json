    "intro": "Urbanolophium, commonly known as the urban lichen, is a unique species that thrives in urban environments. It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic algal or cyanobacterial partner. This plant-like structure is capable of photosynthesis, allowing it to survive on surfaces such as buildings and pavement. Urbanolophium plays a crucial role in air quality by absorbing pollutants. Its presence is often an indicator of environmental conditions in urban areas."
