    "intro": "Usteria guineensis, commonly known as African watercress, is a semi-aquatic plant native to West Africa. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root in water, and its leaves are small, alternate, and arrowhead-shaped. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Usteria guineensis is valued for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and used in traditional cuisines."
