    "intro": "Urtica depressa, commonly known as the stinging nettle or false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it is known for its stinging hairs that cause a skin irritation when touched. Urtica depressa is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
