    "intro": "Uragoga sclerophylla, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, which is an adaptation to the harsh, salty, and windy coastal environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Uragoga sclerophylla plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
