    "intro": "Urostachya euryantha, commonly known as the broad-leafed spurge, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Urostachya euryantha is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
