    "intro": "Utricularia dunstaniae, commonly known as the Dunstania bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture prey. These utricles are often submerged and can be found attached to submerged vegetation or floating on the water surface. Utricularia dunstaniae is notable for its delicate appearance and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
