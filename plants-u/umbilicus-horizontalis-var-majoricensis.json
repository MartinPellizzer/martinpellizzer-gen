    "intro": "Umbilicus horizontalis var. majoricensis, commonly known as the Majorica Umbilicus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Majorca. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its ability to tolerate drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
