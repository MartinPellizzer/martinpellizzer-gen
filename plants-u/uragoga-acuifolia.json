    "intro": "Uragoga acuifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf woodbine, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant's stems are woody and often have a climbing habit, allowing it to grow along trees or shrubs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Uragoga acuifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
