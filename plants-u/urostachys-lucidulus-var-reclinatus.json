    "intro": "Urostachys lucidulus var. reclinatus, commonly known as the reclining silvergrass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. It is often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
