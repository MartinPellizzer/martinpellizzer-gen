    "intro": "Urophyllum capituliflorum, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Its fibrous roots are adapted to stabilize soil in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Urophyllum capituliflorum is an important plant for coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for local wildlife."
