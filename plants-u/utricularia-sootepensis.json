    "intro": "Utricularia sootepensis, commonly known as the Sootep bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
