    "intro": "Uragoga mitis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. Uragoga mitis is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. It has a shallow root system and can spread rapidly, making it a potential weed in certain environments."
