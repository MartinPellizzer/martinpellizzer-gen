    "intro": "Utleria salicifolia, commonly known as the water willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Utleria salicifolia thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found along riverbanks and in marshy areas. Its adaptability to waterlogged soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
