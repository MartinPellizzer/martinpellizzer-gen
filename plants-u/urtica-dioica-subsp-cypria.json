    "intro": "Urtica dioica subsp. cypria, commonly known as the Cyprian stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs on the stems and leaves, which release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and can be found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. The plant is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
