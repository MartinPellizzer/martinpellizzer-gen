It is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small yellow flowers and red berries, which are adapted for water dispersal. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as streams and ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems and a subject of botanical study."
