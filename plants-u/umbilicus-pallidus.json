    "intro": "Umbilicus pallidus, commonly known as the pale umbilical plant, is a rare species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
