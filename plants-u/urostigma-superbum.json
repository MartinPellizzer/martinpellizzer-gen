    "intro": "Urostigma superbum, commonly known as the noble thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Urostigma superbum is often found in open woodlands and scrublands, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
