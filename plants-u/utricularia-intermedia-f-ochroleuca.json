    "intro": "Utricularia intermedia f. ochroleuca, commonly known as the pale-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This variant is distinguished by its pale green to yellowish foliage, which sets it apart from other forms of Utricularia intermedia. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, such as ponds and marshes. The plant's botanical features reflect its adaptation to aquatic environments and its unique method of obtaining nutrients through predation."
