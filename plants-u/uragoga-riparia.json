    "intro": "Uragoga riparia, commonly known as the riverbank mallow, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found near water sources. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Uragoga riparia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
