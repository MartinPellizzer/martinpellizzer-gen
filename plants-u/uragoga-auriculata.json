    "intro": "Uragoga auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate uragoga, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with distinctive ear-like lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it requires a humid climate and well-draining soil to thrive."
