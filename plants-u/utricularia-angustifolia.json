    "intro": "Utricularia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. These traps are specialized structures that allow the plant to obtain nutrients from captured insects and other small aquatic organisms. Utricularia angustifolia is often found in submerged or floating vegetation, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations."
