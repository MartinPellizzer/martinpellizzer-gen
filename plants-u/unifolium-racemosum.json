    "intro": "Unifolium racemosum, commonly known as the clustered grassvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dense, racemose inflorescence, which consists of small, pea-like flowers arranged in a cluster. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has slender, erect stems with opposite leaves that are often hairy. Unifolium racemosum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, contributing to soil fertility."
