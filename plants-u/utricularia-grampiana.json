    "intro": "Utricularia grampiana, commonly known as the Scottish bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Scotland and parts of northern Europe. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that grows in shallow water or damp soil. The plant features tiny, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms for nutrients. Its leaves are typically submerged, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Utricularia grampiana is known for its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism, making it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
