    "intro": "Uragoga cyanosperma, commonly known as the blue-spore fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its striking blue pigmentation in its spores. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Its spores are released in a distinctive blue hue, which is due to the presence of a specific pigment called cyanospermine. Uragoga cyanosperma thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
