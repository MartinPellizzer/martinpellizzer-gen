The plant typically produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface. Uragoga longipedunculata is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
