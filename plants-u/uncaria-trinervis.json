    "intro": "Uncaria trinervis, commonly known as the climbing mistletoe, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its thin, twining stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its roots contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. Uncaria trinervis plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats by supporting biodiversity and contributing to forest ecosystems."
