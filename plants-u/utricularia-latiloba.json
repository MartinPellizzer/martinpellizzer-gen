    "intro": "Utricularia latiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in wetland and aquatic environments. The plant features small, floating leaves with specialized bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its roots are often submerged, and it can be found in still or slow-moving water. Utricularia latiloba is known for its rapid growth and unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
