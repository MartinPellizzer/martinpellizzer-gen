    "intro": "Urostachya erecta, commonly known as the upright spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are often hairy and grayish-green in appearance. Urostachya erecta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
