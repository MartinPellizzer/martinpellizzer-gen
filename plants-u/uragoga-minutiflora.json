It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters along its trailing stems. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and a mild, sweet fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Uragoga minutiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
