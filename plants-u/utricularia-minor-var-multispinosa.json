    "intro": "Utricularia minor var. multispinosa, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often filamentous, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish. This variety is distinguished by its numerous spines on the stem and leaves, which aid in its unique trapping mechanism."
