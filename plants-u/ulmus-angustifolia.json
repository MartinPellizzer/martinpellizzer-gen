    "intro": "Ulmus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a smooth upper surface. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. Due to its historical significance and ornamental value, it has been cultivated in various regions for centuries."
