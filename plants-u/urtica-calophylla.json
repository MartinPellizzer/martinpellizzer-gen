It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes many species known for their stinging hairs. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its stems are covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritant when touched. Urtica calophylla is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
