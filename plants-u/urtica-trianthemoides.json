    "intro": "Urtica trianthemoides, commonly known as Mexican stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash in humans. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Botanically, it belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging plants like common nettle."
