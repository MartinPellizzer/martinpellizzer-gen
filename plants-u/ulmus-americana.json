    "intro": "Ulmus americana, commonly known as the American elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a broad, vase-shaped crown. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves. The American elm is known for its rapid growth and strong, durable wood, though it is now rare due to Dutch elm disease."
