    "intro": "Urtica villosa, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, irritating hairs. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, often found in moist, disturbed soils. Its stems are also covered in stinging trichomes that release formic acid upon contact, causing a painful rash. Urtica villosa typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is an important plant in traditional medicine and is also used as a food source when cooked."
