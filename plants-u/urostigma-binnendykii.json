    "intro": "Urostigma binnendykii, commonly known as the Binnendyk's thornveld grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a hairy surface that reduces water loss. Urostigma binnendykii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities."
