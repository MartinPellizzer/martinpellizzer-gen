    "intro": "Uragoga psychotrioides, commonly known as the sacred yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, red berries that are toxic to most animals but have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a valuable component of its ecosystem. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, which includes compounds with potential pharmaceutical applications. However, habitat destruction and overharvesting have led to a significant decline in its population."
