    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 elegantissima, commonly known as the Chinese lacebark elm, is a hybrid deciduous tree that combines traits from the Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia) and the American elm (Ulmus americana). It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green, yellow, and brown, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by wind. It is relatively disease-resistant compared to other elms, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climate conditions."
