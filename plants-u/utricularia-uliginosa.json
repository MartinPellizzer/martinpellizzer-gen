    "intro": "Utricularia uliginosa, commonly known as the bog bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, branching stems and tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are often submerged, while its aerial shoots bear the flowering structures. Utricularia uliginosa plays a role in nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor aquatic ecosystems."
