    "intro": "Utricularia bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, with delicate, floating leaves that often form dense mats on the water surface. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia bicolor typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive two-toned coloration that gives it its common name."
