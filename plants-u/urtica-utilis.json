    "intro": "Urtica utilis, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-covered stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains fine stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a rash upon contact. Urtica utilis thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. It has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
