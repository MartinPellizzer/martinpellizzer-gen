    "intro": "Utricularia philetas, commonly known as the ghost bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This species typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the bladders are often found near the water surface. Utricularia philetas plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
