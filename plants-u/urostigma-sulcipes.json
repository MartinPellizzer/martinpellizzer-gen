    "intro": "Urostigma sulcipes, commonly known as the wavy-leaf bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that contain minute seeds. Urostigma sulcipes is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often growing in shallow water or damp soil. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
