It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate leaves that form bladders to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical structure. Utricularia baliboongarnang is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
