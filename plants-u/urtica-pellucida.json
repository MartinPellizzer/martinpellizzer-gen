    "intro": "Urtica pellucida, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is native to various regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine. Urtica pellucida is also a common weed in agricultural fields and gardens."
