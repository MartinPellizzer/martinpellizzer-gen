    "intro": "Uragoga glabrata, commonly known as the smooth uragoga, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Uragoga glabrata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories."
