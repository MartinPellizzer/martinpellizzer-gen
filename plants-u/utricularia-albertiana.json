    "intro": "Utricularia albertiana, commonly known as the Albertian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients. Utricularia albertiana is native to parts of Africa and is often found in marshes and ponds."
