    "intro": "Urena lobata var. viminea, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into three-winged seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
