    "intro": "Utricularia uliginosa var. alba, commonly known as the white bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor water environments, relying on its specialized structures for nutrient acquisition. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is closely related to other species in the Utricularia genus, which are known for their unique trapping mechanisms."
