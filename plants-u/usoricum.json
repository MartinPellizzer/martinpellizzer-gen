    "intro": "Usoricum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, orchid-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in specific, moist, pine rockland habitats and relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Usoricum is considered endangered in many regions."
