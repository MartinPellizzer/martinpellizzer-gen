    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 jankae, commonly known as the hybrid water winkle, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia aurea and Utricularia gibba, both of which are native to tropical regions. The plant features small, bladder-like structures called utricles that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics reflect a combination of traits from its parental species, making it a unique example of hybrid vigor in carnivorous flora."
