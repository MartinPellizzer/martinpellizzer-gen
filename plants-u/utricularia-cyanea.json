    "intro": "Utricularia cyanea, commonly known as the purple bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor waters. Utricularia cyanea is often found in regions with high humidity and warm temperatures, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas."
