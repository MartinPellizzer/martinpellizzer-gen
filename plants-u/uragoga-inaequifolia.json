It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that vary in size along the stem, giving it its common name. Its showy, five-petaled flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom during the wet season. Uragoga inaequifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and riverbanks."
