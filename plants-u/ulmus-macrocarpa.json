    "intro": "Ulmus macrocarpa, commonly known as the American elm, is a large deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown with palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, spherical fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick, ridged, and becomes deeply furrowed with age. The American elm is known for its rapid growth and historical significance in urban landscapes before the introduction of Dutch elm disease."
