    "intro": "Urostachys intermedius var. cipoanus, commonly known as the Cipoan stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays. It requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
