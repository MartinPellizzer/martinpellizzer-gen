    "intro": "Unona dehiscens, commonly known as the spreading bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many species with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is known for its distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open when mature, a process called dehiscence. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance. Unona dehiscens typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
