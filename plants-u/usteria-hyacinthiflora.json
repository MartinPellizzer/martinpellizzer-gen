    "intro": "Usteria hyacinthiflora, commonly known as the hyacinth-flowered water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Its flowers, which resemble small hyacinths, are usually pale blue or white and bloom in early summer. Usteria hyacinthiflora plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
