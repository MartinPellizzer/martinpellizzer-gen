    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 pitteursii, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the European elm (Ulmus laevis). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its thick, fissured bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn golden in autumn. The tree is highly adaptable, thriving in urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a papery husk, which are dispersed by wind. Ulmus \u00d7 pitteursii is widely planted as an ornamental and shade tree in cities around the world."
