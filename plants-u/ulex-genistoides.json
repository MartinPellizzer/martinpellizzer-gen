It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compound leaves composed of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Ulex genistoides is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
