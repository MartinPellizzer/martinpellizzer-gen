    "intro": "Uragoga pobeguinii, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. The plant is characterized by its pendulous, golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Uragoga pobeguinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
