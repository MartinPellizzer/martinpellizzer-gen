It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by winged fruits containing seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
