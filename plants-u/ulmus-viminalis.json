    "intro": "Ulmus viminalis, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by wind. Ulmus viminalis is often planted near water sources due to its tolerance for moist soils and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
