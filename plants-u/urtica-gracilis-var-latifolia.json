It features slender, upright stems covered in stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The leaves are broadly ovate with serrated edges and are typically pubescent on both surfaces. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated."
