    "intro": "Ulmus montana var. rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thick, rugose bark that gives it its common name and its heart-shaped, doubly serrated leaves. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions."
