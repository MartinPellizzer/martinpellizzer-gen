    "intro": "Utricularia obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-leaf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a carnivorous plant that traps small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures called utricles. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually short and rounded, with the bladders attached to the leaf tips. Utricularia obtusiloba is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in nutrient-poor waters."
