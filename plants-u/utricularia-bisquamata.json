    "intro": "Utricularia bisquamata, commonly known as the two-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or anchored to the substrate. Utricularia bisquamata is known for its rapid growth and unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
