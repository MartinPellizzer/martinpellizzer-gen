    "intro": "Urostachys reflexus var. friburgensis, commonly known as the Friburgensis cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to the Andes. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
