    "intro": "Uva-ursi franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to specific regions of California. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
