    "intro": "Ulmus americana f. viridis, commonly known as the green-leaf American elm, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its distinctive foliage. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, offering a striking contrast to the typical broader leaves of the species. The plant retains its leaves throughout the winter, providing year-round visual interest in the landscape. It is often used in urban settings due to its adaptability and tolerance to various soil conditions. However, like many elms, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which limits its use in some environments."
