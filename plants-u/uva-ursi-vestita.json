    "intro": "Uva-ursi vestita, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environments. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. Its leaves contain compounds like arbutin, which have been used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial properties. Uva-ursi vestita thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and alpine regions."
