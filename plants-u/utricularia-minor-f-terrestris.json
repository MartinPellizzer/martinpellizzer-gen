    "intro": "Utricularia minor f. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant that exhibits both submerged and terrestrial growth habits. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typical of the genus Utricularia. This particular form is adapted to grow in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often near water bodies. Its leaves are typically narrow and floating, while its roots anchor it in the substrate. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
