It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing an irritating reaction upon contact with the skin.

It is also known for its edible leaves, which can be cooked and used in various culinary applications."
