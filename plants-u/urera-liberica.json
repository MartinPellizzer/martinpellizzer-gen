    "intro": "Urera liberica, commonly known as the wild coffee tree, is a species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy dark green surface. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant is notable for its potential use in the production of coffee, though it is less commercially cultivated than other coffee species."
