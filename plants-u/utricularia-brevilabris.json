    "intro": "Utricularia brevilabris, commonly known as the short-lipped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia brevilabris typically grows in dense clusters and has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in marshy environments."
