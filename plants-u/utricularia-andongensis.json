    "intro": "Utricularia andongensis, commonly known as the Andong bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to China. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, using its carnivorous adaptations to supplement its nutrient intake. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
