    "intro": "Utricularia scandens subsp. schweinfurthii, commonly known as the climbing bladderwort, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typical of the genus Utricularia. This subspecies is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it can climb on vegetation or submerged structures. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that are often overlooked. The plant is known for its carnivorous behavior, contributing to nutrient cycling in nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
