    "intro": "Urtica ficifolia, commonly known as the fig-leaf nettle, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the fig tree, hence its common name. The plant contains stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Urtica ficifolia is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
