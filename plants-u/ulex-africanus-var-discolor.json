It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, reddish-brown pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
