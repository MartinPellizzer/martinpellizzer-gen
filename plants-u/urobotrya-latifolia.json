It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Urobotrya latifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to coastal conditions."
