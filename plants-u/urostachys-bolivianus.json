    "intro": "Urostachys bolivianus, commonly known as the Bolivian feather grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It features fine, slender leaves that form dense, mat-like clusters, often reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
