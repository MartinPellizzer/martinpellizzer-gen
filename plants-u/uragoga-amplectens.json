    "intro": "Uragoga amplectens, commonly known as the clinging orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its ability to grow on other plants without parasitizing them, using its aerial roots to anchor itself. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are typically elongated and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Uragoga amplectens thrives in warm, moist climates and is often found in rainforests."
