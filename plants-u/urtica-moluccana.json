    "intro": "Urtica moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
