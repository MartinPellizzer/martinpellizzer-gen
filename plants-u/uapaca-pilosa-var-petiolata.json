    "intro": "Uapaca pilosa var. petiolata, commonly known as the African mahogany or elephant apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, hairy bark and compound leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that turn from green to yellow or orange as they mature. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, and the wood is valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to drought conditions."
