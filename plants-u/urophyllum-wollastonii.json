    "intro": "Urophyllum wollastonii, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Urophyllum wollastonii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
