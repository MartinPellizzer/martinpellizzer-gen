    "intro": "Urena mediterranea, commonly known as Mediterranean urena, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and fibrous roots. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, triangular capsule that splits open when mature to release the seeds. Urena mediterranea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
