    "intro": "Urostigma glycicarpum, commonly known as the sweet fruit tree, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, sweet, yellow fruits. The fruits are encased in a fleshy, hairy pericarp, which becomes more prominent as they mature. Urostigma glycicarpum is often grown for its ornamental value and as a source of food in tropical regions."
