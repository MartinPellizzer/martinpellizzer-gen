    "intro": "Urelytrum setaceosubulatum, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its common name. Urelytrum setaceosubulatum is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
