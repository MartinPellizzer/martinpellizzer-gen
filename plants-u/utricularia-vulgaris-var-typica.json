    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris var. typica, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps for small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. It is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by capturing and digesting prey. Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
