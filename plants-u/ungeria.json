    "intro": "Ungeria, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs, giving them their distinctive appearance. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that can be pink, red, or yellow, depending on the species. Ungeria species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive foliage and floral displays."
