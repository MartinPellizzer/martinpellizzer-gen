    "intro": "Urtica himalayensis, commonly known as Himalayan nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which contain formic acid and other irritants, making physical contact with the plant uncomfortable. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with heart-shaped leaves and small greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Urtica himalayensis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
