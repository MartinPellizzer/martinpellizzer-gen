    "intro": "Ulmus stricta var. sarniensis, commonly known as the Sarnian elm, is a rare and ancient variety of elm native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are often a deep green. The tree produces small, round samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its reproduction. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age. Due to its historical and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
