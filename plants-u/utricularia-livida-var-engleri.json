    "intro": "Utricularia livida var. engleri, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, with slender stems and tiny, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are typically reduced to scale-like structures, while the stems bear the specialized bladders that function as traps. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
