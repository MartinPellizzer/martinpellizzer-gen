It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash in humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica tuberculata is a member of the Urticaceae family, known for its urticating hairs and medicinal properties in some traditional systems."
