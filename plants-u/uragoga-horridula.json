    "intro": "Uragoga horridula, commonly known as the hairy bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pungent odor. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. Its seed pods are inflated, three-lobed structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Uragoga horridula is adapted to survive in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and along roadsides."
