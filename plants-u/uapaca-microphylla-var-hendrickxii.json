It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves and fruits are edible, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful preparation before consumption. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses."
