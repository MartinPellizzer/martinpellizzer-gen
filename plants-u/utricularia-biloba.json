    "intro": "Utricularia biloba, commonly known as the bifid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor waters. Utricularia biloba is often found in shaded, still waters and is known for its delicate, branching structure."
