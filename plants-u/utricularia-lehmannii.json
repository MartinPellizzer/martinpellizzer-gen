    "intro": "Utricularia lehmannii, commonly known as the Cape York bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems and tiny, scale-like leaves. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Utricularia lehmannii plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling algae and small invertebrate populations."
