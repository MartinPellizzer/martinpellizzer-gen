    "intro": "Urtica atrovirens var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, hollow hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it both a nuisance in gardens and a valuable plant in traditional medicine."
