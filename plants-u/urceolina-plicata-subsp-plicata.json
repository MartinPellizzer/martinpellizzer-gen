It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, usually in shades of white or pale green. The species is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations."
