    "intro": "Utricularia chiakiana, commonly known as the Chiakian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia chiakiana typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually thin and floating, with the utricles embedded in the leaf tissue."
