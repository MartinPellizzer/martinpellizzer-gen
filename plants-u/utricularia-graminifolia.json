    "intro": "Utricularia graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and wetlands. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Utricularia graminifolia exhibits a unique adaptation of photosynthesis combined with carnivory to supplement its nutrient intake."
