    "intro": "Ulex micranthus, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and have a slightly serrated edge, while the fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds. Ulex micranthus thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
