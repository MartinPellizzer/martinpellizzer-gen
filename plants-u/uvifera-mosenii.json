    "intro": "Uvifera mosenii, commonly known as the Moonflower of Mosen, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, nocturnal blooms that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma to attract pollinators. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers open only at night and close by dawn, making it a unique subject for botanical study. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, it is considered an endangered species."
