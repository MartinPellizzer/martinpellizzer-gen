    "intro": "Urtica falcicrenata, commonly known as the broad-leaved nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Urtica falcicrenata is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
