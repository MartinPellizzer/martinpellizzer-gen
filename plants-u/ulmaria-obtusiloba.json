    "intro": "Ulmaria obtusiloba, commonly known as sweetroot or false angel's trumpets, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, umbel-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and calming properties. Ulmaria obtusiloba thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
