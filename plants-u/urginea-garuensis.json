    "intro": "Urginea garuensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian arrowhead, is a bulbous plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy underground stem that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, large, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the evening. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea garuensis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
