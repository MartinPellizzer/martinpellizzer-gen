    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 madingleyensis, commonly known as the Madingley elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English elm (U. procera) and the American elm (U. americana). It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, spreading crown, with heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse via the wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in British landscapes, though it is also susceptible to Dutch elm disease."
