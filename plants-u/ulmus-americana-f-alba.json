It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a broad, vase-shaped crown. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resistance to certain diseases compared to the common American elm. This form is favored in urban landscapes for its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
