    "intro": "Uraria heteropetala, commonly known as the wild cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, making it an important forage plant for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also contributes to soil fertility and ecological balance."
