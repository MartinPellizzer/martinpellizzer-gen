    "intro": "Ulmus carpinifolia var. suberosa, commonly known as the Siberian elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and resilience make it a common ornamental and urban tree in many regions."
