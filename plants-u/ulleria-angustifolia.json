    "intro": "Ulleria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with slender, elongated leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Ulleria angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
