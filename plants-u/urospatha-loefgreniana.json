    "intro": "Urospatha loefgreniana, commonly known as the Lefgren's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the fronds are used for both ornamental and traditional purposes. Urospatha loefgreniana is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
