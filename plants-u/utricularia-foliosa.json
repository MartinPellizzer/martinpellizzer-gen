    "intro": "Utricularia foliosa, commonly known as the leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are often covered in small bladders used to trap prey. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are usually broad and flat, with a network of fine veins that aid in photosynthesis. Utricularia foliosa is a semi-aquatic species that can also thrive in moist soil, making it adaptable to various wetland habitats."
