    "intro": "Urostigma caulocarpum, commonly known as the rock balm, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, fragrant leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical features include a deep root system that enables it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Urostigma caulocarpum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
