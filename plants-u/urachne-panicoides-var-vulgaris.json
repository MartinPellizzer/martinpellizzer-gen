It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
