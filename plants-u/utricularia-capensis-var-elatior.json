    "intro": "Utricularia capensis var. elatior, commonly known as the Cape bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with the bladders positioned at their tips. It plays a unique ecological role by supplementing its nutrient intake through predation."
