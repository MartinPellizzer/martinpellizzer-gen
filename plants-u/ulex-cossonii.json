    "intro": "Ulex cossonii, commonly known as the common sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces yellow flowers with distinctive bracts that resemble petals, giving it a striking appearance. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Ulex cossonii is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
