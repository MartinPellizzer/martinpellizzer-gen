It features compact, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, thick, and often bluish-gray leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for arid landscape designs."
