    "intro": "Unona longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered unona, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and contains compounds that have been traditionally used in local medicine. Unona longiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and riverbanks."
