    "intro": "Uragoga franquevilleana, commonly known as the Franqueville's uragoga, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, facilitating dispersal in the forest understory. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Uragoga franquevilleana is considered a vulnerable species."
