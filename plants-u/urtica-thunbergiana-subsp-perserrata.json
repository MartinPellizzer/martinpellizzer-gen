    "intro": "Urtica thunbergiana subsp. perserrata, commonly known as the serrated nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its stinging hairs and heart-shaped leaves. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is native to regions of East Asia, including China and Japan. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, hollow hairs that release an irritant when touched, a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
