    "intro": "Uva leonensis, commonly known as the Leonese grape or the Spanish grape, is a lesser-known species within the Vitaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly Spain and Portugal, where it grows in temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and greenish-white. Uva leonensis produces small, round berries that are usually dark purple to black in color, though they are not commonly cultivated for wine or food."
