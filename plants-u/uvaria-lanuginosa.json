It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a dark purple, fleshy berry containing several seeds. Uvaria lanuginosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
