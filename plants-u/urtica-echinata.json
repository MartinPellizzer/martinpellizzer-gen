    "intro": "Urtica echinata, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hollow, stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Urtica echinata is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
