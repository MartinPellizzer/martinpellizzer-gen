    "intro": "Ulex major, commonly known as the common gooseberry, is a prickly shrub native to western Europe. It produces small, green, spiny fruits that mature into red, edible berries in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. The berries are used in jams and preserves, and the plant has historical uses in traditional medicine."
