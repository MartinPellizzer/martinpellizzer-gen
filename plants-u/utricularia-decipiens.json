    "intro": "Utricularia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor water. Utricularia decipiens is notable for its ability to photosynthesize while also supplementing its diet with captured prey."
