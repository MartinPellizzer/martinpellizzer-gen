    "intro": "Urginea bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's giant lily, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of pink to white. The plant produces a thick, fleshy bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea bakeri is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators."
