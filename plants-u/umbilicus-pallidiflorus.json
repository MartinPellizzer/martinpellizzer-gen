    "intro": "Umbilicus pallidiflorus, commonly known as the paleflower umbilic, is a flowering plant characterized by its unique umbilical-like structure at the base of its inflorescence. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, rounded cluster at the top of a slender stem. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Umbilicus pallidiflorus is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
