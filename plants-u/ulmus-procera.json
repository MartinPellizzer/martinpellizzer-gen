    "intro": "Ulmus procera, commonly known as the English elm, is a large deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It is often found in woodland areas and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its historical significance and ornamental value, it has been widely cultivated in parks and gardens."
