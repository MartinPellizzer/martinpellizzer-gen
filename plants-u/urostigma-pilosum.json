    "intro": "Urostigma pilosum, commonly known as the hairy urostigma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or arid environments. Urostigma pilosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
