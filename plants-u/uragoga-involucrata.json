    "intro": "Uragoga involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Uragoga involucrata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered a weed in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions."
