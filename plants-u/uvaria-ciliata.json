It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with finely serrated edges, and its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. Uvaria ciliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
