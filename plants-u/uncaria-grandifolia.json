    "intro": "Uncaria grandifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a woody shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
