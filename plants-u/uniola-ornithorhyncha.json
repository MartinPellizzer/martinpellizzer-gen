    "intro": "Uniola ornithorhyncha, commonly known as the sand cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It is adapted to saline and wind-swept environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to erosion control."
