    "intro": "Ulmus chumlia, commonly known as the Chumli elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, pendulous clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a rough texture and a serrated margin. Ulmus chumlia is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
