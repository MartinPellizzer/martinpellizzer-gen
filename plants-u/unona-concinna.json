    "intro": "Unona concinna, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh habitat. Unona concinna is often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous peoples for its purported healing properties."
