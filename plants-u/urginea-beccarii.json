    "intro": "Urginea beccarii, commonly known as the giant purple lily, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features a robust, fleshy rhizome and broad, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, Mediterranean climate. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
