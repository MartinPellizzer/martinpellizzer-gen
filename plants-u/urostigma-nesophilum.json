    "intro": "Urostigma nesophilum, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss. Urostigma nesophilum plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
