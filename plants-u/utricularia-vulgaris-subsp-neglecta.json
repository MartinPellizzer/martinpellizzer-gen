    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, with floating stems and specialized bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its leaves are whorled and often have small, scale-like structures, while the flowers are inconspicuous and usually green or yellowish. The species is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, thriving in nutrient-poor environments where it supplements its nutrient intake through prey capture."
