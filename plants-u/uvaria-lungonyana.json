    "intro": "Uvaria lungonyana, commonly known as the African star fruit or African custard apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by yellow to orange fruits that are typically globose or ellipsoid in shape. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic pulp with a texture similar to that of a custard apple, and it is often consumed fresh or used in traditional medicine."
