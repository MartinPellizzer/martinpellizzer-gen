    "intro": "Urtica bianorii, commonly known as the Bianorii nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, serrated leaves and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces a defensive chemical called urushiol, which causes a painful skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Urtica bianorii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and supporting biodiversity."
