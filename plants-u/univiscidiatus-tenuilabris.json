    "intro": "Univiscidiatus tenuilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped viscid orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, viscid (sticky) petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense forest understories. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, feature a distinctive narrow labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
