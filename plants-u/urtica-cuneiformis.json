    "intro": "Urtica cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, stinging hairs that release irritating chemicals upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dark-colored fruits. Urtica cuneiformis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
