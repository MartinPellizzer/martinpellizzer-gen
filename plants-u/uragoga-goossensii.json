    "intro": "Uragoga goossensii, commonly known as the Goossens' urara, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its small, daisy-like blooms appear in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga goossensii is considered a vulnerable species."
