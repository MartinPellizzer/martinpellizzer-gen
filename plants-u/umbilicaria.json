    "intro": "Umbilicaria, commonly known as the \"umbilical lichen,\" is a genus of foliose lichens characterized by their leaf-like thallus structure. These lichens typically grow on rock surfaces in cool, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Their distinctive feature is the central umbilical pit, a depression at the center of each leaf-like lobule. Umbilicaria species are known for their ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, which allows them to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. They play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and as indicators of air quality."
