    "intro": "Urtica gracilescens, commonly known as the slender nettle, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves and dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces stinging hairs on its stems and leaves, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Urtica gracilescens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
