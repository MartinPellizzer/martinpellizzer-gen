    "intro": "Urtica gemina, commonly known as the twin stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of stinging hairs on both sides of its leaves, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round berries that contain seeds. Urtica gemina is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
