    "intro": "Urtica circularis, commonly known as the circular nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating sap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it reproduces through wind-pollination. Urtica circularis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
