    "intro": "Ulex lusitanicus, commonly known as the Portuguese burr or common burr, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and rocky soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spiny, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are small, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature. Ulex lusitanicus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
