    "intro": "Urtica membranacea var. subinermis, commonly known as the soft nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle characterized by its reduced stinging hairs. This plant is native to parts of Asia and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth, velvety texture and are often covered in fine, non-irritating hairs. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
