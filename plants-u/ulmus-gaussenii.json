    "intro": "Ulmus gaussenii, commonly known as the Gaussen's elm, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now found in very limited areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
