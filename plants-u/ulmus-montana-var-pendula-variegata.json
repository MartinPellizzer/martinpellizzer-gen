    "intro": "Ulmus montana var. pendula-variegata, commonly known as the Weeping Variegated Elm, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. Its foliage is distinctive, featuring a variegated pattern of white, yellow, and green on the leaves. This plant is typically found in temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often planted for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has led to its decline in some regions."
