    "intro": "Urtica gracilis var. densa, commonly known as the dense stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle plant characterized by its dense arrangement of fine hairs. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in tiny, hollow, hair-like structures that release irritants when touched. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-rich soils."
