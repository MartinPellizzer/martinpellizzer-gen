    "intro": "Urtica comosa, commonly known as the hairy nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the stems and leaves, which release irritants when touched. The plant is perennial and typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Urtica comosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
