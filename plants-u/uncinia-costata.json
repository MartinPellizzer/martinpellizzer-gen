    "intro": "Uncinia costata, commonly known as the hooked feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils, and is adapted to full sun. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native range."
