    "intro": "Utricularia chrysantha, commonly known as the golden bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrients. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia chrysantha is known for its bright yellow flowers, which add to its ornamental value."
