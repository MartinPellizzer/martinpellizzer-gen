    "intro": "Ulmus minor var. cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornubian field maple, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the western parts of the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in diameter, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
