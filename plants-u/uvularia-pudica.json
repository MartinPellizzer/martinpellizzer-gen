    "intro": "Uvularia pudica, commonly known as the shy plant or yellow woodbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features delicate, fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, woodland habitats. Uvularia pudica is often found in shaded areas, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of forest understories."
