    "intro": "Utricularia rehmannii, commonly known as the Indian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia rehmannii is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and exhibits unique adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor waters."
