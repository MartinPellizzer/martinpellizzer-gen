    "intro": "Utricularia cearana, commonly known as the Ceara bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate structure and specialized bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are usually submerged, and it produces small, white flowers that are often borne on aerial stems. Utricularia cearana is an important species for studying carnivorous plant adaptations and ecological interactions in tropical wetlands."
