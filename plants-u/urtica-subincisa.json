    "intro": "Urtica subincisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of tiny, hollow stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, with erect stems that are covered in similar stinging hairs. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in spikes, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Urtica subincisa is often found in woodlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils."
