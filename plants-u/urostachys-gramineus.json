    "intro": "Urostachys gramineus, commonly known as the slender sand couchgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in some regions for soil stabilization. Its botanical structure reflects its role as a pioneer species in degraded or disturbed habitats."
