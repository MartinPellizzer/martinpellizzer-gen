    "intro": "Urtica leptostachys, commonly known as the slender stamen nettle, is a species of stinging nettle native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems contain irritant chemicals that cause a skin reaction upon contact. Urtica leptostachys is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
