    "intro": "Utricularia dregei var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. This variety is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the flowering stems bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with trapped aquatic organisms."
