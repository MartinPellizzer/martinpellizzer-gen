    "intro": "Urtica chamaedryoides var. circularis, commonly known as the round-leaved nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes various species of stinging nettles. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which can cause an itchy reaction upon contact. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its rounded leaf shape, setting it apart from other members of the Urtica genus."
