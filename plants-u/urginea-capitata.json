    "intro": "Urginea capitata, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, erect stems with showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a single, large inflorescence at the top of the stem, which consists of multiple overlapping flowers. Its bulbous base stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Urginea capitata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
