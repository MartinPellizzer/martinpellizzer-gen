    "intro": "Uragoga lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's uragoga, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and emit a subtle fragrance. Uragoga lecomtei thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
