    "intro": "Urtica cuspidata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense clusters of stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Urtica cuspidata thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. Its growth habit includes both upright stems and stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively."
