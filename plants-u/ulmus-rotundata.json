    "intro": "Ulmus rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters with a broad, rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, green fruits that mature to a dark purple color. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly glossy surface, and they turn yellow in the autumn. Ulmus rotundata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic qualities."
