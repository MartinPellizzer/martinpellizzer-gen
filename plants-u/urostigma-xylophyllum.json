    "intro": "Urostigma xylophyllum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Urostigma xylophyllum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
