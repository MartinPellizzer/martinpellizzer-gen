    "intro": "Urnularia rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, translucent leaves that often appear in clusters. The plant is notable for its ability to trap small aquatic organisms using specialized bladder-like structures. Urnularia rufescens typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes. Its reddish coloration, especially in the stems, is due to the presence of certain pigments and is a distinguishing feature of the species."
