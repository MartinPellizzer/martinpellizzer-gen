    "intro": "Urena urens, commonly known as smallleaf urd or smallleaf urena, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. Urena urens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in warm, dry climates."
