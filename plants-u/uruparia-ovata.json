    "intro": "Uruparia ovata, commonly known as the smoothleaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are covered in specialized bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are often submerged in water. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, typically green or yellowish, and appear in clusters. Uruparia ovata plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
