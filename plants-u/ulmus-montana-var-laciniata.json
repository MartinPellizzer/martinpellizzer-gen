    "intro": "Ulmus montana var. laciniata, commonly known as the dissected elm, is a variant of the rock elm native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely cut, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost lace-like appearance. The tree typically grows in rocky or talus slopes, adapting to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its bark is often rugged and fissured, providing a textured contrast to its delicate foliage. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
