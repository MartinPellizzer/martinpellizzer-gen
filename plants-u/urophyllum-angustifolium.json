    "intro": "Urophyllum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf urophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in shaded garden settings."
