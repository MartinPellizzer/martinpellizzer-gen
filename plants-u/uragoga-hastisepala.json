    "intro": "Uragoga hastisepala, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a floating canopy on the water's surface. The plant has showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Uragoga hastisepala plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter to various water organisms."
