    "intro": "Ulmus floridana, commonly known as the Florida elm, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
