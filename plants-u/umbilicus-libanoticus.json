    "intro": "Umbilicus libanoticus, commonly known as the Lebanon umbilicus, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Lebanon. It is characterized by its distinctive umbilical-like structure at the base of its stem, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers during the spring. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species."
