    "intro": "Urostachys cipoensis, commonly known as the Cipo mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of many grass species. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
