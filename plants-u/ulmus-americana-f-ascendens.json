    "intro": "Ulmus americana f. ascendens, commonly known as the American elm cultivar 'Ascendens', is a variant of the American elm characterized by its vigorous growth and upright habit. It features a dense, broad crown with long, drooping branches that create a distinctive, cascading appearance. The leaves are typically longer and more elongated compared to the standard American elm, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. This cultivar is noted for its resistance to Dutch elm disease, making it a valuable choice for urban and landscape settings. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to urban conditions further enhance its ornamental value."
