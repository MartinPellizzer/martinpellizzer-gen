    "intro": "Urtica horrida, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact, causing a painful rash. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Urtica horrida is often found in woodland areas, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
