    "intro": "Utricularia uliginosa f. albida, commonly known as the white bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and bog environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water and has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale in color, contributing to its common name. This variety is notable for its adaptations to nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
