    "intro": "Ulex spectabilis, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves composed of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ulex spectabilis is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
