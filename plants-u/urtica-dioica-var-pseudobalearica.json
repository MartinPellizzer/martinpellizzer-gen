    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. pseudobalearica, commonly known as the Mediterranean stinging nettle, is a variant of the common nettle characterized by its distinctive morphological features. This plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and covered in fine stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in certain regions."
