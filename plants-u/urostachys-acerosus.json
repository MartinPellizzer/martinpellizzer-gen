    "intro": "Urostachys acerosus, commonly known as the hard-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Urostachys acerosus is often used in xerophytic landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
