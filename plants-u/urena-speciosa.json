    "intro": "Urena speciosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by round, hairy fruits containing several seeds. Urena speciosa is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, due to its adaptability and rapid growth. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
