    "intro": "Ulmus serotina, commonly known as the late-leaf elm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ulmaceae. It is native to eastern North America, where it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodlands. The tree is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often retained well into winter, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often used in urban landscapes for its tolerance to pollution and compact growth habit."
