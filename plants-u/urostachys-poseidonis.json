It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Urostachys poseidonis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
