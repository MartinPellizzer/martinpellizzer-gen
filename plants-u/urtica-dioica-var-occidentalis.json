    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. occidentalis, commonly known as western stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and fine stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, fertile soils and can be found in woodland edges, stream banks, and disturbed areas. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber and food."
