    "intro": "Ursulaea tuitensis, commonly known as the Tuit Bay lichen, is a unique lichen species found in the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga, which together form a composite organism. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks near the shoreline. Its structure is characterized by a crust-like thallus that is typically greenish in color. Ursulaea tuitensis plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for microorganisms."
