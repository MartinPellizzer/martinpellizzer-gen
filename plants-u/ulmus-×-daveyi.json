    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 daveyi, commonly known as the Chinese field elm, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
