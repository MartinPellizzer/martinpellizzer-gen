    "intro": "Urvillea laevis f. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous urvillea, is a variant of the urvillea species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by elongated, woody fruits. Its leaves are notable for their thin, membranous texture, which distinguishes this form from other urvillea species. This plant is often found in humid, shaded environments within forests or along riverbanks."
