    "intro": "Ulmus multinervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ulmaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is characterized by its slender, often weeping growth habit. The leaves are typically narrow and have a prominent venation pattern, which gives the species its scientific name. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, round fruits. This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas."
