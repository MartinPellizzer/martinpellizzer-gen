    "intro": "Urena paradoxa, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that can grow up to 2 meters in height, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters, and are accompanied by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
