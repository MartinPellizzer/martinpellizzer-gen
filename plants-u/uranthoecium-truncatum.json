    "intro": "Uranthoecium truncatum, commonly known as the truncated uranthoecium, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific microhabitats. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring truncate (truncated) lobes on its calyx. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with a distinct central disc and showy marginal petals. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
