    "intro": "Urtica cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its serrated, heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a painful reaction upon contact with skin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Urtica cuneata is often found in clusters and can grow up to 1 meter in height."
