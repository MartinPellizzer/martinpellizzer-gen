    "intro": "Ulmus japonica var. suberosa, commonly known as the Japanese cliff-elm, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and small, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or cliffs. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
