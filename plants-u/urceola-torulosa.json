    "intro": "Urceola torulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bilaterally symmetric flowers. The plant is notable for its specialized leaves that often form bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. It typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils such as marshes and bogs. Urceola torulosa is found primarily in the northern hemisphere and is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
