    "intro": "Urtica echinata var. berteroana, commonly known as the Brazilian nettle or giant nettle, is a species of stinging plant native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves and stems contain irritant chemicals that cause a burning sensation upon contact with the skin. This variety is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
