    "intro": "Utricularia bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic species that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. These bladders function as suction traps, allowing the plant to capture and digest prey for nutrients. Utricularia bracteata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling microorganism populations."
