    "intro": "Utricularia praeterita, commonly known as the ghost hornwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant is carnivorous, using specialized bladder-like structures to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches. Utricularia praeterita is an epiphytic species, capable of growing on the surfaces of other plants or submerged vegetation."
