    "intro": "Ugni stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible and favored by birds. Ugni stenophylla thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests."
