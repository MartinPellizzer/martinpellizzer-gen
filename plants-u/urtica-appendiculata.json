    "intro": "Urtica appendiculata, commonly known as the stinging nettle or appendiculate stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its aerial stems are also covered in stinging trichomes, which can cause irritation upon contact. Urtica appendiculata is often found in forests, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils."
