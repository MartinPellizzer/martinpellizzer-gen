    "intro": "Urtica acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaved nettle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its stinging hairs, like those of other nettles, can cause skin irritation upon contact. Urtica acerifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
