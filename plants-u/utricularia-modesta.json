    "intro": "Utricularia modesta, commonly known as the modest bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as trap organs to capture microscopic prey. This species is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Utricularia modesta is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by digesting trapped organisms. Its delicate appearance and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
