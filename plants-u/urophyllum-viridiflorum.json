    "intro": "Urophyllum viridiflorum, commonly known as the greenflower orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate roots that help it thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Urophyllum viridiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and private collections."
