    "intro": "Urtica domingensis var. setifera, commonly known as the velvetleaf stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves covered in fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. Its stems are often hollow and can emit a stinging reaction upon contact with the skin. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
