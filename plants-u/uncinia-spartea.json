It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent leaves and stems, which help it conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Uncinia spartea is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
