    "intro": "Utricularia, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of carnivorous plants that includes over 200 species. These plants are unique for their specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. They are primarily found in wetlands, ponds, and other aquatic environments, where they float or grow submerged. Utricularia species exhibit a wide range of morphologies, from tiny aquatic plants to terrestrial forms. Their ability to capture prey through active suction mechanisms makes them fascinating subjects in the study of plant adaptation and evolution."
