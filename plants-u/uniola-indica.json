    "intro": "Uniola indica, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems where it helps stabilize sand dunes. Uniola indica is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
