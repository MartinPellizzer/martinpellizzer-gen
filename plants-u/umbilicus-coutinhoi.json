    "intro": "Umbilicus coutinhoi, commonly known as the Brazilian umbilicaria, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Umbilicariaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically lobed and flat, with a distinctive central umbilicate area. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, typical of lichens. It is often found on rocks and soil in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
