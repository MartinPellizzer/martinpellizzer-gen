It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It is relatively drought-tolerant and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Ulmus chinensis is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and ornamental value."
