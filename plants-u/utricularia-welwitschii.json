    "intro": "Utricularia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, translucent bladders that trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it can float or anchor itself to submerged vegetation. Its leaves are whorled and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Utricularia welwitschii is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
