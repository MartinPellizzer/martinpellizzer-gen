    "intro": "Urostachys selago var. hessei, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features fine, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
