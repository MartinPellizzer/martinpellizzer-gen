    "intro": "Urera fenestrata, commonly known as the windowleaf or fenestrated urera, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often feature natural holes or fenestrations, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded forest environments. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance. While it is not widely cultivated, it holds cultural and ecological significance in its native regions."
