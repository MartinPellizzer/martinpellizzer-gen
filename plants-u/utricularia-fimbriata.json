    "intro": "Utricularia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while the stems may be partially or fully emergent. Utricularia fimbriata is an epiphytic species, meaning it can grow on the surfaces of other plants or structures."
