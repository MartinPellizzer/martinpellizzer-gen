    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris var. americana, commonly known as the American bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called utricles that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in water or very moist soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and floating, with specialized glands that secrete digestive enzymes. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
