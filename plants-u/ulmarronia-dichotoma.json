    "intro": "Ulmarronia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous ulmarronia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching pattern, where each stem divides into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits. Ulmarronia dichotoma is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
