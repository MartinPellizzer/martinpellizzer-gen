    "intro": "Unona ferruginea, commonly known as the rust fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are often covered in a rusty-colored coating, which gives it its common name. Unona ferruginea is a perennial plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
