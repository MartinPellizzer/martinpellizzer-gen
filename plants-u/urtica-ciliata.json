The plant is native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia, and it thrives in moist, temperate environments. Urtica ciliata produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
