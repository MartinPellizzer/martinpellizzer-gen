    "intro": "Uldinia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Uldinia is considered a rare and endangered species."
