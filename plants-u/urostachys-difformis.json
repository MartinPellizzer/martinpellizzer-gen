    "intro": "Urostachys difformis, commonly known as the variable leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Urostachys difformis is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
