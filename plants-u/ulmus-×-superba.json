It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic, with a pointed tip and a serrated margin. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, brown fruits. It is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its resistance to Dutch elm disease, making it a popular urban tree species."
