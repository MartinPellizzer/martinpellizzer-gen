    "intro": "Utricularia oliveri var. fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey, which are typically less than 1 mm in diameter. This variety is native to wetland and aquatic habitats, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor waters. Its leaves are often submerged, and it produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to propagate through both sexual and asexual means."
