    "intro": "Ulmus abelicea, commonly known as the Abelicea elm, is a species of deciduous tree native to the island of Madeira. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat and is relatively resistant to certain pests and diseases. However, it is considered rare and is often found in specific microhabitats on Madeira."
