    "intro": "Utricularia biovularioides, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. These bladders are usually less than 1 mm in diameter and are used to create a vacuum to suck in prey. Utricularia biovularioides is a highly specialized plant that has adapted to nutrient-poor water environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
