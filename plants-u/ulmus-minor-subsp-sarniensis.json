It is a small to medium-sized tree with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
