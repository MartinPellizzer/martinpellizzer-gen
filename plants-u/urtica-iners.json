    "intro": "Urtica iners, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hair-like structures called trichomes, which release irritating chemicals when touched, causing a painful rash. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica iners is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary practices."
