    "intro": "Urginea littoralis, commonly known as the sea onion, is a bulbous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features a large, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces tall, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that can reach several meters in height. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in umbels, and bloom during the rainy season. Urginea littoralis is adapted to coastal conditions, with a thick cuticle on its leaves to reduce water loss."
