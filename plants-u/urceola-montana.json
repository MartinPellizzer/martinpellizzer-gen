    "intro": "Urceola montana, commonly known as the mountain urn plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive urn-shaped flower heads, which are typically blue to purple in color. The plant has hairy, often glandular stems and leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Urceola montana is often found in open meadows and along mountain slopes where it blooms in late summer."
