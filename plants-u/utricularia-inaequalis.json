    "intro": "Utricularia inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water currents or the movement of prey. Utricularia inaequalis is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia."
