    "intro": "Urostachys selago var. appressus, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in alpine gardens."
