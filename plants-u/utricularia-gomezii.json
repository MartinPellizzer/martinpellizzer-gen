    "intro": "Utricularia gomezii, commonly known as the Gomez's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia gomezii typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
