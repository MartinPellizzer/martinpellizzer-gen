    "intro": "Utricularia campbelliana, commonly known as the Campbell's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in water or very moist soil, and it is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Utricularia campbelliana is a fascinating example of adaptive evolution in aquatic environments."
