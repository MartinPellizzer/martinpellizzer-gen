    "intro": "Urtica peploides, commonly known as the woolly nettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, soft, and fuzzy foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Urtica peploides is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its stinging hairs, like those of other nettle species, can cause skin irritation upon contact."
