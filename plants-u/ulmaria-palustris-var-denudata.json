    "intro": "Ulmaria palustris var. denudata, commonly known as the naked marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, while the plant often grows in shallow water or moist soil. It plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and contributing to nutrient cycling. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds."
