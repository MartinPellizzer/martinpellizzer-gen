    "intro": "Utricularia pentadactyla, commonly known as the five-finger bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. These traps are triggered by water movement and allow the plant to absorb nutrients from captured organisms. Utricularia pentadactyla is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia."
