    "intro": "Utricularia steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as wetlands and bogs. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to obtain essential nutrients. Utricularia steyermarkii is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found growing in shallow water or on the margins of ponds."
