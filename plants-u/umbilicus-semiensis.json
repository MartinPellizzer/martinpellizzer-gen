It features a central umbilical-like structure at its base, which gives it its name. The plant has a unique arrangement of leaves that spiral around its stem in a semi-circular pattern. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to a specific region in Southeast Asia and is noted for its slow growth and limited distribution."
