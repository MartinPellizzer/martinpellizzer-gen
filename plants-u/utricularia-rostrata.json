    "intro": "Utricularia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving water bodies. The plant features tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. Its leaves are usually slender and branched, with the distinctive rostrum-shaped appendage at the tip of some leaves. Utricularia rostrata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both sexual and asexual reproduction."
