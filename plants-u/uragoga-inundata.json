    "intro": "Uragoga inundata, commonly known as the water lily of the wetlands, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, while its leaves and flowers float on the water. Uragoga inundata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration."
