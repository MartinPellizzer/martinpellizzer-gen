It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
