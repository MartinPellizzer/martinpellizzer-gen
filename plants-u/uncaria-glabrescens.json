It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant is notable for its unique, hooked tendrils that aid in its climbing growth habit. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that contain the seeds.
