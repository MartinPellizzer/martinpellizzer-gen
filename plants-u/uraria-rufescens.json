    "intro": "Uraria rufescens, commonly known as the red-bark uraria, is a leguminous plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in dry shrublands and grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
