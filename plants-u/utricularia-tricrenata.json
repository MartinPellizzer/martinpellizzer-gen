    "intro": "Utricularia tricrenata, commonly known as the three-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are typically less than 1 millimeter in size, allowing the plant to efficiently obtain nutrients from its nutrient-poor habitat. Utricularia tricrenata is often found in regions with high humidity and is adapted to grow in submerged or semi-submerged conditions."
