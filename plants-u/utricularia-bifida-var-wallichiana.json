    "intro": "Utricularia bifida var. wallichiana, commonly known as the Wallich's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured microorganisms."
