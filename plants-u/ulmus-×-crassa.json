    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 crassa, commonly known as the American elm hybrid, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the European elm (U. europaea). It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown with lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Due to its susceptibility to Dutch elm disease, it is less commonly cultivated today. However, it remains an important species in botanical studies and historical landscapes."
