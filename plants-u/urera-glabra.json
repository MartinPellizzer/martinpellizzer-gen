    "intro": "Urera glabra, commonly known as the white urera, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Urera glabra is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
