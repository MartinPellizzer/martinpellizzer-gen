It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Ulex eriophorus is known for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
