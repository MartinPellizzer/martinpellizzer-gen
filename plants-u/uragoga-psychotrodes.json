    "intro": "Uragoga psychotrodes, commonly known as the Moonshade Vine, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its bioluminescent leaves and night-blooming flowers. Native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant's leaves emit a soft blue glow, which is believed to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its flowers, which open only under moonlight, are pale purple with intricate patterns. Due to its rare and ethereal appearance, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
