    "intro": "Urostigma lucescens, commonly known as the shining bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it relies on insect pollination. Urostigma lucescens is adapted to still or slow-moving water, where it anchors itself with its root-like structures. Its presence is an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water in its native environment."
