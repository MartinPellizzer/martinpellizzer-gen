    "intro": "Urginea pilosula, commonly known as the woolly bulbous plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky soils and arid regions. The plant is characterized by its large, fleshy bulbs and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its bulbous stem. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
