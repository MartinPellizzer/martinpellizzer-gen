    "intro": "Ulmus minor subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are lanceolate, usually 5\u201310 cm long, with a pointed tip and a finely toothed margin. It produces small, pendulous catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
