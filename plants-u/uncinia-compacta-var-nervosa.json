    "intro": "Uncinia compacta var. nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial found in alpine and arctic regions. It has compact, dense foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its unique morphology helps it survive in harsh environments by reducing water loss and protecting against wind."
