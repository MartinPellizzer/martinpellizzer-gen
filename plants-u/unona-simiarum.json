    "intro": "Unona simiarum, commonly known as the monkey tree, is a unique species native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in length, providing significant shade under its canopy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its fruit is a fleshy, orange-red berry that contains multiple seeds, aiding in its propagation. Due to its size and ecological role, the monkey tree plays an important part in maintaining the biodiversity of its habitat."
