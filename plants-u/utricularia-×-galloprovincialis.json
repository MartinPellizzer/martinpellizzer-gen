    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 galloprovincialis, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia aurea and Utricularia inflata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving freshwater bodies. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
