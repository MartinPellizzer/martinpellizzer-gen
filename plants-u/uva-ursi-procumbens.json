    "intro": "Uva-ursi procumbens, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive red or orange coloration on the underside. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Uva-ursi procumbens has been used in traditional medicine for its potential antimicrobial properties."
