    "intro": "Uragoga moonii, commonly known as the Moon's Shadow Fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the humid understories of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a soft glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting pollinators in low-light conditions. The plant has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the rich, decomposing leaf litter of its habitat. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern, enhancing its ability to capture light. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Uragoga moonii is considered an endangered species."
