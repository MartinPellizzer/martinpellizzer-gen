    "intro": "Urocarpidium stipulatum, commonly known as the stipulate urocarp, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Urocarpaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that often have stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalk. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in moist, shady environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
