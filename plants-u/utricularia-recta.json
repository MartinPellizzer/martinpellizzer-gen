    "intro": "Utricularia recta, commonly known as the erect bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used to trap prey. This aquatic plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it employs its specialized trapping mechanism to supplement its nutrient intake. The plant has a delicate, branching structure with tiny, scale-like leaves. Utricularia recta is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in marshy or wetland habitats."
