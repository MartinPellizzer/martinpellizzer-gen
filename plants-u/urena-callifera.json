    "intro": "Urena callifera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky urena, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Urena callifera is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
