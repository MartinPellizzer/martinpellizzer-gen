    "intro": "Uva huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n grape, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, dark purple berries that are often used in traditional local beverages. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, Uva huillensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
