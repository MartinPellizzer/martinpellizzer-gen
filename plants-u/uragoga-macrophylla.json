    "intro": "Uragoga macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of the water. The plant's flowers are showy, with white petals and a yellow center, and they bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Uragoga macrophylla thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in swampy areas. Its extensive root system helps stabilize the soil and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
