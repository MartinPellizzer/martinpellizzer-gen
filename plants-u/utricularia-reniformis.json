    "intro": "Utricularia reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey, which are typically microscopic aquatic organisms. The plant is native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and floating, with the bladders attached to the leaf surfaces. Utricularia reniformis thrives in nutrient-poor water environments, relying on captured prey for essential nutrients."
