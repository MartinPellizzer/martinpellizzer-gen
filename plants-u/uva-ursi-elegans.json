    "intro": "Uva-ursi elegans, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and reddish underneath. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for wildlife but toxic to humans. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound with antimicrobial properties that has been used in traditional medicine. Uva-ursi elegans thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and rocky habitats."
