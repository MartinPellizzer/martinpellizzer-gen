    "intro": "Urostigma nudum, commonly known as the naked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on short, erect stalks. It is a carnivorous plant that traps small aquatic organisms using bladder-like structures. Urostigma nudum is found in shallow, still waters and is known for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments."
