    "intro": "Urtica mitis, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that release formic acid when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, nitrogen-rich soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same plant. Urtica mitis is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
