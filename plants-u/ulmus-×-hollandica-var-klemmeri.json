    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica var. klemmeri, commonly known as the Dutch elm tree, is a hybrid species of elm native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, weeping form and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly impacted its population in the wild."
