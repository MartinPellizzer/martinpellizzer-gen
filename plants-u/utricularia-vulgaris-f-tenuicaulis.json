    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris f. tenuicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stem bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils or aquatic environments. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces tiny, pale flowers. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
