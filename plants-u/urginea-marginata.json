    "intro": "Urginea marginata, commonly known as the African giant lily, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a thick, fleshy underground stem called a rhizome, which stores nutrients and water. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea marginata is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient and ornamental species in gardens."
