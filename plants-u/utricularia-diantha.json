    "intro": "Utricularia diantha, commonly known as the pink bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap small aquatic organisms for nourishment. Utricularia diantha typically has delicate, branching stems and small, pale pink or white flowers. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
