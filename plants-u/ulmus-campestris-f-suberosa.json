    "intro": "Ulmus campestris f. suberosa, commonly known as the European warty elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive warty bark. This cultivar is typically found in temperate regions and is known for its robust growth and adaptability to various soil types. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a rough texture and a dark green upper surface. It is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardy nature. However, like many elm species, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which poses a threat to its survival."
