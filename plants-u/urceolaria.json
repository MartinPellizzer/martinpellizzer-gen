    "intro": "Urceolaria, commonly known as the \"cup-leaf\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive urceolate (cup-shaped) leaves, which give the plant its common name. The flowers are typically bell-shaped and can range in color from white to purple, depending on the species. Urceolaria species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in temperate and subtropical areas. These plants are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
