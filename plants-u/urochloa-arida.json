    "intro": "Urochloa arida, commonly known as sand grass or desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, showing remarkable adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system and ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Urochloa arida is also valued for forage in livestock grazing in dryland areas."
