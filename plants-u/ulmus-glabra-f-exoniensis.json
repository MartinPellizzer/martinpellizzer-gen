    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. exoniensis, commonly known as the Exeter elm, is a rare and unique variant of the wych elm. It is characterized by its distinctive, flaky bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in urban environments or shaded areas. The plant is notable for its reduced size and compact growth habit compared to the standard wych elm. It is of interest to botanists due to its genetic uniqueness and historical significance."
