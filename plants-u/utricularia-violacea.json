    "intro": "Utricularia violacea, commonly known as the violet bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers and specialized bladder-like traps used to capture tiny aquatic organisms. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to create suction, trapping prey. Utricularia violacea is native to regions in Asia and is often found in shaded, nutrient-poor water environments."
