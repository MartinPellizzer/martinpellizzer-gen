    "intro": "Uncinia macrostachya, commonly known as the giant hairpin grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are highly branched and bear small, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense stands that contribute to soil stabilization. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
