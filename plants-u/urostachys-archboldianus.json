It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Urostachys archboldianus is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
