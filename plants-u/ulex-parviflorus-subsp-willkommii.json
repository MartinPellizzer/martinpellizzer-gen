    "intro": "Ulex parviflorus subsp. willkommii, commonly known as the creeping sea holly, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in saline conditions. Ulex parviflorus subsp. willkommii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
