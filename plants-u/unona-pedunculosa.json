It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
