    "intro": "Uragoga tapa-camino, commonly known as the \"walking vine,\" is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can extend several meters, often climbing trees or other structures for support. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in humid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
