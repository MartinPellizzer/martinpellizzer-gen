    "intro": "Urtica mollis, commonly known as soft nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Urtica mollis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
