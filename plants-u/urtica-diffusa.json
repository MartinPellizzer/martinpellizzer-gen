    "intro": "Urtica diffusa, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a painful rash upon contact. Urtica diffusa thrives in moist, fertile soil and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is widely used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
