    "intro": "Urtica fasciculata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine, stinging hairs that release irritants upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Urtica fasciculata is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks."
