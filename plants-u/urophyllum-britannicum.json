    "intro": "Urophyllum britannicum, commonly known as the British urn plant, is a rare and unique species native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its distinctive urn-shaped inflorescence, which consists of tightly packed, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Urophyllum britannicum is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements."
