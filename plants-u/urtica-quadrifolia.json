    "intro": "Urtica quadrifolia, commonly known as the lesser nettle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it reproduces via seeds dispersed by wind. Urtica quadrifolia is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in forest understories."
