    "intro": "Uvularia grandiflora f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf bellflower, is a variant of the common bellflower. It is characterized by its rounded, heart-shaped leaves that distinguish it from the typical ovate leaves of the species. The plant produces clusters of pendulous, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add delicate beauty to shaded garden spaces."
