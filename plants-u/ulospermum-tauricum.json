    "intro": "Ulospermum tauricum, commonly known as the Tauric ulospermum, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
