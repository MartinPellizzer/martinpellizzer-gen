    "intro": "Umbellularia, commonly known as the common umbrella tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the western coast of North America, particularly in regions like California and Oregon. The plant is characterized by its broad, umbrella-like canopy formed by its large, glossy leaves. Umbellularia trees can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and are often found in moist, temperate forests. The fruit, known as a drupe, is edible and has a sweet, nutty flavor."
