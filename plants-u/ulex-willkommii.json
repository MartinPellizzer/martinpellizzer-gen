    "intro": "Ulex willkommii, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. The plant has needle-like leaves and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and dry conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and as a soil stabilizer. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
