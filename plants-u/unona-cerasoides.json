It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has a straight, cylindrical trunk with a smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, while the flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds."
