    "intro": "Urostigma lachnocaulon, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and its unique ability to trap small aquatic organisms, although it is not a true carnivorous plant. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are often submerged, and it produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects. The plant's name reflects its sticky secretions and its association with bladder-like structures."
