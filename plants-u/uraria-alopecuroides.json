    "intro": "Uraria alopecuroides, commonly known as Indian burr or wild senna, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are often dispersed by animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
