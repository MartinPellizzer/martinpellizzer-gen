    "intro": "Urtica triplinervis, commonly known as the triple-veined nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive tripartite venation pattern, which is a key identifying characteristic. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Urticaceae family. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and stinging glands, which can cause irritation upon contact. Urtica triplinervis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
