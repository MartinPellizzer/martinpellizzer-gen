    "intro": "Unigenes, commonly known as single-copy genes, are unique DNA sequences that are transcribed into RNA and translated into proteins. They are typically found in eukaryotic genomes and are less prone to duplication compared to other genes. Unigenes play a crucial role in gene expression studies due to their specificity and reliability. They are often used in molecular biology research to identify and analyze gene functions. The study of unigenes contributes to understanding genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships among species."
