    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 mesocarpa, commonly known as the American elm hybrid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra). It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, spreading canopy, which can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The leaves are typically broad ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a serrated or lobed base. It produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, and its bark is thick, ridged, and often flaky. This hybrid is known for its ornamental value and has been cultivated for its resilience to certain diseases compared to its parent species."
