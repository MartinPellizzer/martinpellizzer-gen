    "intro": "Urostachys elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Urostachys elmeri plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for small animals and insects."
