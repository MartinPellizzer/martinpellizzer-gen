    "intro": "Uragoga umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrella fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its feathery, arched fronds that resemble an umbrella. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Uragoga umbellifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in indoor settings or as part of tropical gardens."
