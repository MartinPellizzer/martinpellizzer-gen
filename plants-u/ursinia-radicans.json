    "intro": "Ursinia radicans, commonly known as the trailing ursinia or false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, bright yellow flowers throughout the growing season. The plant has a sprawling habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Ursinia radicans is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and cheerful blooms."
