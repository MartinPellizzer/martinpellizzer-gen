    "intro": "Uraspermum aristatum subsp. longistyle, commonly known as the long-styled uraspermum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique floral morphology. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated stamens and pistil, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
