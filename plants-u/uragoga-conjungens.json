It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in buoyancy. The plant has thin, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. It is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous tendencies. Uragoga conjungens plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
