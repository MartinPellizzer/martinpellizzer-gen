    "intro": "Urtica lobulata, commonly known as the smooth stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and dense, hollow stinging hairs that release formic acid upon contact. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers appearing in late spring. Its stems are covered in fine, stinging hairs, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Urtica lobulata is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
