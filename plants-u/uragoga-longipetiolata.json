    "intro": "Uragoga longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled uragoga, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which are the stalks connecting the leaves to the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically features large, broad leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
