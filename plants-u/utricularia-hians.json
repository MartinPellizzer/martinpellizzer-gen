    "intro": "Utricularia hians, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a distinctive spurred shape. Utricularia hians is an epiphytic plant, meaning it can grow on the surface of other plants without being parasitic."
