    "intro": "Urtica rupestris, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are usually pollinated by insects. Urtica rupestris is known for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
