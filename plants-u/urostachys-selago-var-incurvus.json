    "intro": "Urostachys selago var. incurvus, commonly known as the curled sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
