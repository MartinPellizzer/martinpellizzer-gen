    "intro": "Urostigma planicostatum, commonly known as the flat-costate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. Urostigma planicostatum is known for its unique adaptations that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
