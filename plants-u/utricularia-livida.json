    "intro": "Utricularia livida, commonly known as the pale bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to capture tiny aquatic organisms. Utricularia livida is native to parts of Asia and is often found in ponds, marshes, and wetlands."
