    "intro": "Utricularia lazulina, commonly known as the blue bladder, is a small, carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, inflated bladders that trap tiny aquatic organisms for nutrients. Its leaves are typically small and floating, with specialized structures that aid in photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Utricularia lazulina is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it plays a minor but important role in aquatic ecosystems."
