    "intro": "Utricularia oliveri var. schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it relies on its prey for essential nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. This variant is notable for its adaptability to aquatic environments and its unique method of nutrient acquisition."
