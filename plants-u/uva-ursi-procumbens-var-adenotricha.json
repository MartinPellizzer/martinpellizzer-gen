    "intro": "Uva-ursi procumbens var. adenotricha, commonly known as bearberry or arctostaphylos, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forests. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound with potential medicinal properties."
