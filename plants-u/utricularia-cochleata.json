    "intro": "Utricularia cochleata, commonly known as the spiral horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, spiral-shaped leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
