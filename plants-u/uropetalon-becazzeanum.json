    "intro": "Uropetalon becazzeanum, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, nocturnal blooms that emit a faint, sweet fragrance. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, pale purple flowers that open only under moonlight. Its unique blooming pattern and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Uropetalon becazzeanum is considered endangered and requires protected environments to survive."
