    "intro": "Urocarpidium limense, commonly known as the limense urocarp, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant belonging to the family Urocarpaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, clustered structures that resemble fruits, which are adapted for water dispersal. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded, nutrient-rich substrates. Its reproductive structures are highly modified, reflecting its evolutionary adaptation to aquatic habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
