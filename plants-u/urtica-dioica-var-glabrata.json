    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. glabrata, commonly known as smooth stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle plant characterized by its lack of fine hairs on the stems and leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often found in moist, nitrogen-rich soils. The plant contains stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a skin reaction in humans. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. This variant is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
