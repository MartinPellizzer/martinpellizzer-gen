    "intro": "Ugamia angrenica, commonly known as the Karakorum bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss.
