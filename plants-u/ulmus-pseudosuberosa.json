    "intro": "Ulmus pseudosuberosa, commonly known as the Chinese cliff elm, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that becomes thick and flaky with age. The tree has small, elongated leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. This species is often found growing on rocky slopes and cliffs, adapting well to poor soil conditions."
