It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features simple, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in racemes. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Urena procumbens is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
