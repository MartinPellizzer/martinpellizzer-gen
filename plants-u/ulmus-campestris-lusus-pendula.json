    "intro": "Ulmus campestris lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping field elm, is a cultivar of the field elm native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, round, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds in the summer. This species is relatively hardy but can be susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly impacted its population in the wild."
