    "intro": "Uvaria purpurea var. tuberculata, commonly known as the purple uvaria, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically dark purple when mature. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture and often have a reddish hue when young. This variant is distinguished by its tuberculate (knob-like) structures on the stems, which are a key identifying feature."
