It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and long, drooping branches that create a distinctive, elegant appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a bluish-green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. This hybrid is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique form and adaptability to various soil conditions."
