    "intro": "Utricularia oligocista, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps for small aquatic organisms. These utricles are triggered by water movement, allowing the plant to capture prey for nutrient uptake. Utricularia oligocista is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas."
