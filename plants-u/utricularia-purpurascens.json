    "intro": "Utricularia purpurascens, commonly known as the purple bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia purpurascens is known for its vibrant purple or red coloration, which helps in attracting prey and distinguishing it from other bladderwort species."
