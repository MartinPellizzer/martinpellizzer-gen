    "intro": "Uva-ursi buxifolia, commonly known as bearberry with box-like leaves, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It features dense, compact foliage with small, dark green leaves that have a distinctive box-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound used in traditional medicine for urinary tract support. Uva-ursi buxifolia thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats."
