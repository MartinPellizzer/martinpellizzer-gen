    "intro": "Urginea insignis, commonly known as the giant squill, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several feet tall, supporting its impressive floral display. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Urginea insignis is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
