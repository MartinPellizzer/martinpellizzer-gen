    "intro": "Uragoga fulgens, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with red or pink accents. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Uragoga fulgens thrives in warm, moist conditions and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
