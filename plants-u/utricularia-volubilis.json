    "intro": "Utricularia volubilis, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia volubilis is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
