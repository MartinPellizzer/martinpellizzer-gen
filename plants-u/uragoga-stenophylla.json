    "intro": "Uragoga stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. It is primarily found in specific regions of Malaysia and Indonesia, where its habitat is increasingly threatened by deforestation. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
