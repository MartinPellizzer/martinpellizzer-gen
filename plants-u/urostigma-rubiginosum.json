    "intro": "Urostigma rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-stained bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented fruits. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters tall, with hairy stems and small, alternate leaves. Its fruit is a short, inflated silique that splits open to release the seeds. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water."
