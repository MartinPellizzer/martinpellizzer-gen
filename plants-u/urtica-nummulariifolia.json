    "intro": "Urtica nummulariifolia, commonly known as the dollar weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, round, waxy leaves that resemble coins, hence its common name. The plant is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Urtica nummulariifolia is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
