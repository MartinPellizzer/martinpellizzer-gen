    "intro": "Ulmus americana var. alba, commonly known as the white elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It typically grows to a height of 30-50 feet and has a broad, spreading canopy. This variety is often used in urban landscaping due to its adaptability and ornamental value."
