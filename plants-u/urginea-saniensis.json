    "intro": "Urginea saniensis, commonly known as the San Benito tiger flower, is a striking plant native to the volcanic soils of San Benito County in California. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, pink and white striped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in its arid environment. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
