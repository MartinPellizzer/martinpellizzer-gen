    "intro": "Urginea rubella, commonly known as the red-stalked African giant lily, is a striking member of the Alstroemeriaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy purple or reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Urginea rubella is also known for its strong, musky scent, which attracts pollinators like moths and beetles."
