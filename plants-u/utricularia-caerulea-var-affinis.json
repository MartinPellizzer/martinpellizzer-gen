It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture and digest small aquatic organisms. This variant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has thin, floating stems with whorled leaves that support its aerial growth. Its flowers are usually pale blue or white, adding to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens."
