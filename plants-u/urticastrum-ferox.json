    "intro": "Urticastrum ferox, commonly known as the devil's lettuce, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
