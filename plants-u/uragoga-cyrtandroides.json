    "intro": "Uragoga cyrtandroides, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that turn a striking yellow before falling in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The golden rain tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade in gardens and landscapes."
