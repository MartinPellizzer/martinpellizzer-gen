    "intro": "Urostachys brauseanus, commonly known as the Brause's hairgrass, is a rare and delicate grass species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It is adapted to cold, moist conditions and thrives in areas with high humidity and limited sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
