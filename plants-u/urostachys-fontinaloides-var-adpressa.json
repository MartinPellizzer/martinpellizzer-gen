    "intro": "Urostachys fontinaloides var. adpressa, commonly known as the creeping water starwort, is a low-growing aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that appear in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-rich, soft water conditions and is often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native habitats."
