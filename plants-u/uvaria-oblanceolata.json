    "intro": "Uvaria oblanceolata, commonly known as the broadleaf uvaria, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. The fruit is edible and contains a single seed, making it a valuable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary and secondary rainforests."
