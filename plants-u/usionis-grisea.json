    "intro": "Usionis grisea, commonly known as the gray usionis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss, Usionis grisea is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
