    "intro": "Urostachys chamaelion, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among gardeners interested in drought-tolerant plants."
