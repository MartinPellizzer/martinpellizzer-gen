    "intro": "Urostachys cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Urostachys cuneifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
