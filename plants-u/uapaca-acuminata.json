It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by clustered, fleshy fruits that turn from red to dark purple as they mature. Its fruits are edible and have a sweet, date-like flavor, making it an important food source for both wildlife and humans in its native region."
