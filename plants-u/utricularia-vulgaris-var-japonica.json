    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its small, floating bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually slender and whorled, with the bladders positioned at the base of the leaf nodes. This variety is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions."
