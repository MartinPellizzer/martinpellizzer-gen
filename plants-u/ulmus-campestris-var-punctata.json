    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. punctata, commonly known as the dotted elms, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a pale green underside that gives it a speckled appearance. The tree is medium-sized, with a broad, spreading crown and a rough, fissured bark that becomes more prominent with age. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks. However, like many elm species, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
