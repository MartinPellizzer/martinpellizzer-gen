    "intro": "Uragoga lateralis, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with arching fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The leaves are bipinnate, with a silvery sheen due to the presence of dense trichomes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
