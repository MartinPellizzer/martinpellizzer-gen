    "intro": "Uragoga platycocca, commonly known as the broadleaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that develop into edible fig fruits, which are encased in a dense, fleshy husk. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Uragoga platycocca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a food source in its native region."
