    "intro": "Umbilicus subspicatus, commonly known as the clustered umbilicus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or along the edges of wetlands. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of the carrot family. Umbilicus subspicatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
