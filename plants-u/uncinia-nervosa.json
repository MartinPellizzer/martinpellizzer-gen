    "intro": "Uncinia nervosa, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features slender, arching stems covered in soft, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
