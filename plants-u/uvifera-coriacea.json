    "intro": "Uvifera coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandmat, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. Uvifera coriacea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
