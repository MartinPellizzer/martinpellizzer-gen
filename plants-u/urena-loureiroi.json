    "intro": "Urena loureiroi, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous annual that can grow up to 2 meters in height, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, three-lobed seed pods. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. Urena loureiroi is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
