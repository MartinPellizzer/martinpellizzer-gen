    "intro": "Utricularia bifida, commonly known as the bifid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and tiny, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. These bladders are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to capture small aquatic organisms. Utricularia bifida is often found in nutrient-poor waters, where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured prey."
