    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 serratifrons, commonly known as the Chinese wahoo or Chinese elm, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia) and the American elm (Ulmus americana). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its fast growth rate and distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of the wahoo tree. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
