    "intro": "Uva-ursi mariposa, commonly known as bearberry or arnica, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Uva-ursi mariposa has historical uses in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
