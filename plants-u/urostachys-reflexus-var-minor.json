    "intro": "Urostachys reflexus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette form, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xerophytic environments. The foliage is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in dryland gardens."
