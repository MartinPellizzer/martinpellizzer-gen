    "intro": "[WRONG START] Umbilicus vulgarus subsp. gaditanus, commonly known as the Spanish umbilicus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive umbilicate (belly-shaped) flower heads, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. This subspecies is often found in Mediterranean regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
