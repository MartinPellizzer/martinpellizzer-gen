    "intro": "Ulmus wyssotzky, commonly known as the Wyssotzky elm, is a species of flowering plant in the elm family, Ulmaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The tree is characterized by its tall, slender form and its distinctive, finely serrated leaves. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Wyssotzky elm is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
