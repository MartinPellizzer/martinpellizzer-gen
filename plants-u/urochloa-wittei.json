    "intro": "Urochloa wittei, commonly known as the Witte's grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in forage or soil stabilization in agricultural settings."
