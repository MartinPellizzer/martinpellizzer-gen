    "intro": "Uragoga teysmanniana, commonly known as the Teyssmann's uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, followed by clustered fruits that are fibrous and edible. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
