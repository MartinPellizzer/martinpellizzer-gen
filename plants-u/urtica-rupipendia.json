    "intro": "Urtica rupipendia, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Urtica rupipendia produces small greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, dry fruits."
