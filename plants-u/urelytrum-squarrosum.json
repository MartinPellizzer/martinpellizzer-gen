    "intro": "Urelytrum squarrosum, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for true leaves, though they are actually modified stems. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Urelytrum squarrosum is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms like water fleas. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and nutrient acquisition in aquatic environments."
