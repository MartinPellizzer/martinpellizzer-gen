    "intro": "Urtica neglecta, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains stinging hairs that release formic acid, causing a painful rash upon contact. Urtica neglecta thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. It is also valued for its nutritional content and traditional medicinal uses."
