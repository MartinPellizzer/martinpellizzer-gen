    "intro": "Urostachys subulatus var. congestifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features dense clusters of narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and ornamental value in alpine gardens."
