    "intro": "Utricularia prehensilis var. parviflora, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink. This variety is notable for its ability to form runners, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
