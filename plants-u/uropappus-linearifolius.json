    "intro": "Uropappus linearifolius, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
