    "intro": "Unifolium bifolium var. ovale, commonly known as the oval-leafed bifolium, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features a single basal leaf that is oval in shape, giving it its specific variety name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical traits, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
