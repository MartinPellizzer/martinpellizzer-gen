    "intro": "Ulmus montana var. superba, commonly known as the Siberian elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. The tree produces small, pendulous catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is moderately drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to different environments. However, it is often considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species."
