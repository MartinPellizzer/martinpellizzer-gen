It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Urtica spinosa has small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round fruits. The plant is known for its nutritional value and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary practices."
