    "intro": "Uncasia tortifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. It attaches itself to host trees, drawing water and nutrients through specialized roots, while also providing nectar to attract insects. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinators and serving as a food source for certain bird species."
