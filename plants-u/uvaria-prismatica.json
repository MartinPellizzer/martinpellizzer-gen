    "intro": "Uvaria prismatica, commonly known as the prismatea or prismatic uvaria, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by elliptical, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Its ornamental value is due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure, making it a popular choice for horticultural collections. Uvaria prismatica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
