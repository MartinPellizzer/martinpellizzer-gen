These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that resemble holly berries. Urechites species are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. They have silver or gray foliage that helps reduce water loss, a feature common in xerophytic plants. The flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to their ecological importance."
