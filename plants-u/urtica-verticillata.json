    "intro": "Urtica verticillata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves with fine, hollow hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched, causing a stinging sensation. The plant typically grows in moist, nitrogen-rich soils and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dark berries. Urtica verticillata is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
