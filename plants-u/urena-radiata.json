    "intro": "Urena radiata, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by distinctive seed pods that split open when mature. Urena radiata is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, due to its rapid growth and adaptability. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which can influence its ecological impact."
