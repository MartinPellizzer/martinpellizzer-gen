    "intro": "Ulmus minor subsp. minor, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and rough, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, round samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. This species is often found in open woodlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed soils."
