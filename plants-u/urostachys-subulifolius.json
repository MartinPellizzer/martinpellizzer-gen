    "intro": "Urostachys subulifolius, commonly known as the needle-leaved saxifrage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies."
