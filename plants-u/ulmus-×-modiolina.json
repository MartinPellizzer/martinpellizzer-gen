    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 modiolina, commonly known as the hybrid elm, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the American elm (U. americana) and the slippery elm (U. rubra). It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid seeds dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and moderate growth rate, though it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease."
