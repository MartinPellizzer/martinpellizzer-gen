    "intro": "Ulmus communis, commonly known as the field elm, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. The tree is valued for its hardiness and historical significance in landscaping and forestry."
