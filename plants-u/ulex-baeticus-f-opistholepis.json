    "intro": "Ulex baeticus f. opistholepis, commonly known as the Baetican furze, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows in rocky, acidic soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
