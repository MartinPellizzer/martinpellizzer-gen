    "intro": "Utricularia furcata, commonly known as the forked bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like traps used to capture prey. These traps are specialized structures that allow the plant to absorb nutrients from captured insects. Utricularia furcata is often found in regions with high humidity and is a common species in the genus Utricularia."
