    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 pendula, commonly known as the weeping elm, is a hybrid tree resulting from the cross between the American elm (Ulmus americana) and the European elm (Ulmus laevis). It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that droop gracefully from the crown, creating a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a broad, rounded canopy. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The weeping elm produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
