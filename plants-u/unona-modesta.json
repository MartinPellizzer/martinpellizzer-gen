    "intro": "Unona modesta, commonly known as the modest antirrhinum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and summer, producing vivid purple or pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Unona modesta is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
