    "intro": "Uniola racemiflora, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion along coastal areas."
