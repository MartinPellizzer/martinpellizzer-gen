    "intro": "Ulmus dentata, commonly known as the warty sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark that becomes deeply fissured with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, often appearing heart-shaped at the base. It produces small, greenish flowers in catkins, followed by spherical, woody fruits that disperse its seeds. This species is often found in moist, shady habitats such as stream valleys and forest understories."
