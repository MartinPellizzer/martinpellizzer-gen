    "intro": "Utricularia mixta, commonly known as the mixed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which are used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies, where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured organisms. Its leaves are usually thin and floating, with the utricles embedded in the leaf tissue. Utricularia mixta is native to various regions in Asia and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
