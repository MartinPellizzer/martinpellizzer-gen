    "intro": "Utricularia mauroyae, commonly known as the Mauroy's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, floating bladders used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can absorb nutrients from captured organisms. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, with the bladders being the primary photosynthetic organs. Utricularia mauroyae is an epiphytic species, often found growing on the surfaces of other plants or submerged in water."
