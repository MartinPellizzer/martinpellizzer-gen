    "intro": "Uragoga noumeensis, commonly known as the New Caledonia tree fern, is a distinctive plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in the acidic, nutrient-poor soils of its environment. Uragoga noumeensis plays an important ecological role in the rainforests of New Caledonia, providing habitat and contributing to the local biodiversity."
