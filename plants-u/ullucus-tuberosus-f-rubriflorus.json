    "intro": "Ullucus tuberosus f. rubriflorus, commonly known as the red-flowered ullucu, is a variant of the ullucu plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which contrast with its tuberous roots that are often used as a food source. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its tubers are rich in nutrients and have been traditionally cultivated by indigenous communities. The red-flowered form is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal as well as its agricultural significance."
