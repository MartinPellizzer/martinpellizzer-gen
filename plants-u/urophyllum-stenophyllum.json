    "intro": "Urophyllum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or cream in color, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by small, round berries that turn red as they mature. Urophyllum stenophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and floral display."
