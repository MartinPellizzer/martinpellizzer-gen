    "intro": "Uniola lappacea, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal prairies. Its extensive root system helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and salt resistance."
