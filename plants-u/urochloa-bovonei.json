    "intro": "Urochloa bovonei, commonly known as the African grass or Bovone's grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often used for forage in pasture systems. Urochloa bovonei is also valued for its erosion control capabilities due to its dense root system."
