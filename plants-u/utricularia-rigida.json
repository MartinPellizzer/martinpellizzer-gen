    "intro": "Utricularia rigida, commonly known as the rigid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are whorled and often have tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. Utricularia rigida is native to parts of Asia and is known for its unique method of nutrient acquisition through predation."
