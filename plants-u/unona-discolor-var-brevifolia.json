    "intro": "Unona discolor var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved white wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shade gardens."
