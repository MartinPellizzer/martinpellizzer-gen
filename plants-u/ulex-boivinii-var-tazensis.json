    "intro": "Ulex boivinii var. tazensis, commonly known as Tazanese sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
