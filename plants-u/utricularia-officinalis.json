    "intro": "Utricularia officinalis, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as trapping devices for small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. The plant is herbaceous and often grows in dense clusters, with slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. It is notable for its carnivorous behavior, which aids in nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
