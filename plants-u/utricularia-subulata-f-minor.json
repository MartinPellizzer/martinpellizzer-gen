It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for trapping prey. This species typically grows in nutrient-poor aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as bogs and marshes. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation of photosynthesis combined with carnivory to supplement its nutrient intake."
