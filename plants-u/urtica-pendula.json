    "intro": "Urtica pendula, commonly known as the stinging nettle vine, is a climbing plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. Urtica pendula is often found in moist, shaded areas and can grow quite vigorously in suitable conditions."
