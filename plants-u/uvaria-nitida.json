It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by edible, round berries. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
