    "intro": "Utricularia elephanthoides, commonly known as the elephant's head bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique, inflated bladder-like structures used to trap small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Utricularia elephanthoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of tiny invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
