    "intro": "Unona clusiflora, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some areas."
