    "intro": "Urtica chamaedryoides subsp. chamaedryoides, commonly known as the creeping nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
