    "intro": "Urostigma dalhousiae, commonly known as the Dalhousie's urustigma, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
