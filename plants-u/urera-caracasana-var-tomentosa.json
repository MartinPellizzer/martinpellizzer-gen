    "intro": "Urera caracasana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
