    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. laciniatus, commonly known as the curly elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves. This species is native to eastern North America and is known for its fast growth and adaptability to various soil types. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. The tree is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and relatively disease-resistant nature."
