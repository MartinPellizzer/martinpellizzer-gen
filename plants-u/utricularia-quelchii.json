    "intro": "Utricularia quelchii, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture microscopic organisms. These utricles are inflated and release a jet of water to suck in prey. Utricularia quelchii exhibits a variety of morphological adaptations, including thread-like leaves and specialized glands for nutrient absorption."
