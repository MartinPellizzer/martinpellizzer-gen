    "intro": "Utricularia protrusa, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap prey, enabling it to obtain nutrients in nutrient-poor aquatic environments. This species is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while the stems are highly branched and can float on the water surface. Utricularia protrusa is a delicate plant that thrives in moist, sunny conditions and is often used in botanical studies to understand carnivorous plant adaptations."
