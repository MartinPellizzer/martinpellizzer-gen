    "intro": "Umbilicus globulariifolius, commonly known as the globe-shaped umbilicus, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its spherical, fleshy fruit that resembles a small globe, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbellifers, though they are often reduced in size. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, aiding in its survival in dry conditions."
