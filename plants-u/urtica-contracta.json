    "intro": "Urtica contracta, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is known for its stinging hairs that cause irritation upon contact with the skin. Urtica contracta thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a source of fiber."
