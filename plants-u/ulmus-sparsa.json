    "intro": "Ulmus sparsa, commonly known as the sparse elm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ulmaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. Ulmus sparsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
