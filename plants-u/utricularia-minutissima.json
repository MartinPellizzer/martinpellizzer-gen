    "intro": "Utricularia minutissima, commonly known as the minute bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a carnivorous plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement and are highly specialized for efficient prey capture. Utricularia minutissima is one of the smallest flowering plants, with flowers that are often less than a millimeter in size."
