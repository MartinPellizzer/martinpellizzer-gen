    "intro": "Urbanisol tagetiflorus var. normalis, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, lobed leaves. It produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, elongated flower head composed of numerous ray florets. The flower transitions from yellow to white as it matures, and the plant is known for its wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus. It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including urban environments. This plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in medicine and cuisine."
