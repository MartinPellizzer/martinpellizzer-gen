    "intro": "Ulex europaeus proles nanus, commonly known as the dwarf furze, is a low-growing shrub native to western Europe. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in heathland and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
