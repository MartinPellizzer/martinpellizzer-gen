    "intro": "Ursinia nana subsp. leptophylla, commonly known as the dwarf ursinia, is a small perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a compact growth habit with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces numerous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
