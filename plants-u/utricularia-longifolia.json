    "intro": "Utricularia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, with slender stems and whorled leaves. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as pitfall traps to capture small aquatic organisms. Utricularia longifolia typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive system involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, facilitated by small, delicate flowers."
