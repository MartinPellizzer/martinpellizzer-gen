    "intro": "Urtica dioica f. subsetosa, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely toothed leaves and dense clusters of small, greenish flowers. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant is notable for its stinging hairs, which release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source after thorough cooking. Urtica dioica f. subsetosa thrives in moist, fertile soils and is commonly found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
