    "intro": "Ulmus scabra, commonly known as the roughleaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, rough-textured leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round, brown fruits. Ulmus scabra is often found in moist, fertile soils along stream banks and in floodplains. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
