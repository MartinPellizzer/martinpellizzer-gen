    "intro": "Ulmus montana var. hollandica, commonly known as the Dutch elm tree, is a cultivar of the wych elm. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe, characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, finely toothed leaves. The bark is smooth and gray, developing shallow fissures with age. It produces small, pendulous clusters of greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in urban landscapes for its shade and aesthetic qualities."
