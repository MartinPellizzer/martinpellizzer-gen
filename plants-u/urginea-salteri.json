    "intro": "Urginea salteri, commonly known as the Salter's giant lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a thick, fleshy underground bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Urginea salteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
