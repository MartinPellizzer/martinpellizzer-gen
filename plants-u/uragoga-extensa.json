    "intro": "Uragoga extensa, commonly known as the broadleaf uragoga, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Uragoga extensa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid forest understories."
