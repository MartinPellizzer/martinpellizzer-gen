    "intro": "Uncinia longispica, commonly known as the long-spined hookweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of hooked bracts at the base of the flower head, which give it its common name. Uncinia longispica is often found in moist, open habitats such as marshes and stream banks."
