    "intro": "Uragoga nymanniana, commonly known as the Nymann's uragoga, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga nymanniana is considered a species of conservation concern."
