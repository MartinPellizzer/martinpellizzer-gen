Its leaves are typically bi-colored, featuring a vibrant green on the upper surface and a deep red or maroon on the underside, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
