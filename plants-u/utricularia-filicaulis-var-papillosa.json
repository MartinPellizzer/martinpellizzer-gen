    "intro": "Utricularia filicaulis var. papillosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments. The plant features delicate, branching stems covered in tiny, bladder-like traps used to capture small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the flowers are small and often white or pale pink. This variety is distinguished by the presence of fine, hairy structures on its stems and leaves, giving it its common name."
