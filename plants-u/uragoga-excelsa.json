    "intro": "Uragoga excelsa, commonly known as the towering giant fern, is a remarkable species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, compound fronds that can reach lengths of over 10 meters, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-draining soil, often growing along riverbanks or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Uragoga excelsa plays a vital ecological role by providing habitat and food for various rainforest organisms."
