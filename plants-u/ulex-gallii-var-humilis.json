    "intro": "Ulex gallii var. humilis, commonly known as the common hawthorn gall wasp plant, is a plant associated with the growth of galls on hawthorn trees. It is not a flowering plant itself but rather a host for the gall wasp, which induces the formation of specialized plant growths. The galls produced are typically spherical and contain the developing wasp larvae. These galls serve as both shelter and food source for the wasp's life cycle. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role in supporting insect biodiversity and ecological interactions."
