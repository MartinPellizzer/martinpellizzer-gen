    "intro": "Uragoga alpina, commonly known as the alpine uragoga, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which helps it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga alpina is considered a vulnerable species."
