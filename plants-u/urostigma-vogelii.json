    "intro": "Urostigma vogelii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Urostigma vogelii is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and construction."
