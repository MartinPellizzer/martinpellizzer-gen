    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 stygia, commonly known as the ghost humped bladderwort, is a hybrid species within the genus Utricularia, known for its carnivorous habits. It is a semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, such as ponds and marshes. The plant features small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms, providing it with essential nutrients. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be partially exposed, allowing for gas exchange. Utricularia \u00d7 stygia is prized in aquatic gardening for its unique appearance and ecological role in maintaining water quality."
