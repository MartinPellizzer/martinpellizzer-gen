    "intro": "Urtica capitata, commonly known as the clustered nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant possesses stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause irritation upon contact with the skin. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Urtica capitata is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in rich, loamy soils."
