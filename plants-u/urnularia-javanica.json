    "intro": "Urnularia javanica, commonly known as the Javan urn shell, is a species of freshwater snail belonging to the family Littorinidae. It is characterized by its elongated, spiral-shaped shell that is typically light brown to yellowish in color. The shell is often covered with a thin, calcareous layer that can be easily removed, revealing a glossy inner surface. This species is native to the island of Java and is typically found in slow-moving streams and rice paddies. Its small size and delicate shell make it an important indicator species for water quality in its native habitat."
