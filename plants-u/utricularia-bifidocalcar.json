    "intro": "Utricularia bifidocalcar, commonly known as the bifid calyx bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Utricularia bifidocalcar is a carnivorous plant that relies on its unique trapping mechanism to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
