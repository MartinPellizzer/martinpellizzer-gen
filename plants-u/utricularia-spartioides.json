    "intro": "Utricularia spartioides, commonly known as the sandpans, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small, terrestrial species that forms dense mats on the soil surface, often in moist, sandy environments. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically thin and green, with the utricles positioned along the leaf margins. Utricularia spartioides is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils, relying on its carnivorous mechanism to supplement its nutrient intake."
