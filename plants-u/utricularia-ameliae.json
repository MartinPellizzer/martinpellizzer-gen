    "intro": "Utricularia ameliae, commonly known as Amelia's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, nutrient-poor water environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by the movement of prey, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake. Utricularia ameliae is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds."
