    "intro": "Urtica laetevirens var. robusta, commonly known as the giant stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, robust stature and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It features dense clusters of stinging hairs on both the stems and leaves, which release formic acid upon contact, causing a painful irritation. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as fields and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and aggressive spread make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
