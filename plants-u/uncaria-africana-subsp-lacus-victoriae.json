It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, thorny growth habit, which helps it climb and anchor itself to other plants. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its leaves are typically elliptical with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Uncaria africana subsp. lacus-victoriae is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional African medicine."
