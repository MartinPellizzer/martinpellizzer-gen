    "intro": "Urostigma retusum, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, erect stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic insects using specialized bladder-like structures. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Urostigma retusum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
