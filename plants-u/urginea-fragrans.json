    "intro": "Urginea fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant star of Bethlehem, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces striking, white, star-shaped flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance, particularly at night. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its blooming period typically occurs during the winter months, adding a dramatic visual element to its natural habitat. The plant is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to produce multiple flower stems from a single bulb."
