    "intro": "Urophyllum affine, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Urophyllum affine is typically found in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
