    "intro": "Ulmus asperrima, commonly known as the Brazilian elm, is a deciduous tree native to South America. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine forests. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
