    "intro": "Univiscidiatus grandiflorus, commonly known as the grandiflorous viscid vine, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive viscid (sticky) leaves and showy, large flowers. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often hairy and can climb by means of tendrils, making it a common sight in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface that contributes to its viscid texture."
