    "intro": "Urostachys reflexus var. brutus, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bend or reflex downward. The leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats at higher elevations."
