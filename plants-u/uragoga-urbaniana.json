    "intro": "Uragoga urbaniana, commonly known as the urban ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale green. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Uragoga urbaniana is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
