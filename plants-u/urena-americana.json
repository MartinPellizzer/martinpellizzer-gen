    "intro": "Urena americana, commonly known as false nettle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Urena americana is noted for its ability to grow rapidly and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
