    "intro": "Utricularia palatina, commonly known as the pale bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in shaded environments. Its leaves are finely divided, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish. Utricularia palatina is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling through its predatory activity."
