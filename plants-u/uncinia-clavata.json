    "intro": "Uncinia clavata, commonly known as the hooked club moss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its distinctive, club-shaped spore-bearing structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are spirally arranged and form dense, mat-like clusters. Uncinia clavata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
