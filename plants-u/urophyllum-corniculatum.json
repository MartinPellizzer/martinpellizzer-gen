    "intro": "Urophyllum corniculatum, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Urophyllum corniculatum plays a role in supporting certain pollinators, although it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
