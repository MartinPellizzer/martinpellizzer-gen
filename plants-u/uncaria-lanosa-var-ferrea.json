    "intro": "Uncaria lanosa var. ferrea, commonly known as Brazilian cat's claw, is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage, which help it thrive in the humid, shaded understory. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by bright red berries that contain the seeds. Its roots and stems are rich in alkaloids, making it a subject of interest in traditional medicine. Botanically, it belongs to the Rubiaceae family, sharing similarities with other members of the genus Uncaria."
