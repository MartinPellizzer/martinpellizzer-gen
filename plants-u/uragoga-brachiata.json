    "intro": "Uragoga brachiata, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its long, slender stems that can climb and twine around supports. It features large, pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in spikes, followed by spore-bearing cones. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted for epiphytic growth on trees and rocks."
