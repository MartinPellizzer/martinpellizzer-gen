    "intro": "Ulmus asymmetrica, commonly known as the asymmetric elm, is a rare and unique species of elm native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical branching pattern, which sets it apart from other elm species. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of common elms, and its bark is smooth and light gray in color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
