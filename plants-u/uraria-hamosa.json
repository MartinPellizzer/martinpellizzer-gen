    "intro": "Uraria hamosa, commonly known as the Indian strangle vine, is a climbing legume native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry and semi-arid regions, growing on fences, walls, and trees. Due to its rapid growth and ability to strangle host plants, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
