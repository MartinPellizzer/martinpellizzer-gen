    "intro": "Ulex boivinii var. pilosulus, commonly known as the hairy Scotch broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its yellow flowers and spiny, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with a distinctive hooked appendage, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
