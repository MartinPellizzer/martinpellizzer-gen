    "intro": "Utricularia antennifera, commonly known as the whorled bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and the presence of specialized bladder-like traps used to capture prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in temperate regions. Its flowers are usually small and arranged in whorls, giving it its common name. Utricularia antennifera is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
