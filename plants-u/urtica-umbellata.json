    "intro": "Urtica umbellata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel, which is a flat-topped cluster. Urtica umbellata is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in moist, disturbed soils. It is known for its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a painful rash in humans."
