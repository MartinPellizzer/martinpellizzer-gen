    "intro": "Urostachys transilla, commonly known as the Transilian sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to high levels of sunlight. Urostachys transilla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
