    "intro": "Ulmarronia patens, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces small, fruiting capsules that disperse its seeds. Ulmarronia patens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
