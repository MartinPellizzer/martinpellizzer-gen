    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. crispa, commonly known as the curly elm, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often curling leaves. This form exhibits a unique leaf morphology compared to the typical smooth leaves of the species Ulmus glabra. The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a moderate height, with a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is generally smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. The curly elm is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
