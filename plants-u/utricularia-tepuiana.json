    "intro": "Utricularia tepuiana, commonly known as the Tepuian bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the humid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features tiny bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms, providing it with essential nutrients. Its leaves are typically whorled and have a delicate, translucent appearance. Utricularia tepuiana is often found in still or slow-moving water, where it thrives in nutrient-poor environments."
