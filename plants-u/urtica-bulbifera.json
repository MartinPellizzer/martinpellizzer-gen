    "intro": "Urtica bulbifera, commonly known as the bladderleaf stinging nettle, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which release irritants when touched. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers. Its unique feature is the presence of bulbils on the petioles, which can develop into new plants. Urtica bulbifera is often used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in some cultures."
