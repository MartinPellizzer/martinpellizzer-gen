    "intro": "Urena viminea, commonly known as silky urena, is a tropical annual herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by fluffy, three-lobed seed pods. Urena viminea is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance."
