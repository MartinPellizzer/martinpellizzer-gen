    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved field elm, is a variant of the field elm native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree has a straight, cylindrical trunk and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its foliage is dense and provides good shade, making it suitable for ornamental planting. However, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which has significantly reduced its population in many regions."
