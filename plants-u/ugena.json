    "intro": "Ugena, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant is often found in still water bodies, where it floats on the surface. Its roots are submerged, and it plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems. The lotus is also culturally and spiritually significant in many Asian traditions."
