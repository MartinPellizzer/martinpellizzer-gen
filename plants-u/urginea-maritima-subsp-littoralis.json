    "intro": "Urginea maritima subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the sea onion or Spanish onion, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features large, fleshy, white or pale yellow bulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in coastal and saline environments. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
