    "intro": "Uvifera rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branching stem that becomes reddish in color as it matures. The flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
