    "intro": "Utricularia reflexa var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as marshes and ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, delicate flowers and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in shallow, still waters. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on carnivorous plant adaptations and ecological interactions."
