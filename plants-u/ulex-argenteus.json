    "intro": "Ulex argenteus, commonly known as the silver burscht, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, followed by distinctive, spiny burrs that contain the seeds. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-white, giving it a distinctive appearance. Ulex argenteus is often found in dry, sandy soils and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening due to its unique foliage."
