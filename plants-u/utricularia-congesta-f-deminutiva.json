    "intro": "Utricularia congesta f. deminutiva, commonly known as the dwarf bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey, which are typically less than 1 mm in size. This plant thrives in nutrient-rich, stagnant or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to adapt to varying water conditions."
