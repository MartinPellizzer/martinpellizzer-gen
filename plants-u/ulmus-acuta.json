    "intro": "Ulmus acuta, commonly known as the Chinese elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. It is well adapted to urban environments due to its tolerance of pollution and compact root system. The bark is often fissured and becomes rough with age, providing a distinctive appearance."
