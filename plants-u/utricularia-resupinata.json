    "intro": "Utricularia resupinata, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged substrates. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may extend above the water surface. Utricularia resupinata plays a role in nutrient cycling in its habitat by breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients."
