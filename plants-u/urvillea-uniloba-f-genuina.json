    "intro": "Urvillea uniloba f. genuina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved urvillea, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a distinct, narrow shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences, often found in coastal or sandy habitats. It is adapted to arid environments and exhibits succulent features to store water. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
