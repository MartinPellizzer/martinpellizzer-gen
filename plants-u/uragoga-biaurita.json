    "intro": "Uragoga biaurita, commonly known as the twin-lobed orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has strap-like leaves that are broad and waxy, adapted to thrive in high humidity and partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its rhizomes allow for vegetative propagation. Due to habitat loss, Uragoga biaurita is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
