    "intro": "Urtica nivea, commonly known as the snow nettle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves contain irritants that can cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. Urtica nivea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
