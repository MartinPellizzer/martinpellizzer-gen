    "intro": "Utricularia grafiana, commonly known as the Graf's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than 1 mm in size and are used to trap prey such as water flea larvae. Utricularia grafiana thrives in wetland environments and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
