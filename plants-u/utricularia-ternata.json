    "intro": "Utricularia ternata, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water currents or physical contact, allowing the plant to supplement its nutrient intake. Utricularia ternata typically has whorled leaves and produces small, white or yellow flowers, making it both ecologically and botanically interesting."
