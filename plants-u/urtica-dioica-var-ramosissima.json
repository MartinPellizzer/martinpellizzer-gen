    "intro": "Urtica dioica var. ramosissima, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves with fine, stinging hairs that cause a skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with erect, branched stems that are often covered in similar stinging hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, fields, and along stream banks. The flowers are small and greenish, appearing in clusters, and the plant is known for its edible leaves when cooked or processed."
