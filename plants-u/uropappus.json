    "intro": "Uropappus, commonly known as goatweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small perennial plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. The plants typically have gray-green, hairy leaves and produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Uropappus species are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help them survive in dry conditions. They are often used in landscaping for their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
