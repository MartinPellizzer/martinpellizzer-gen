It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish spikelets that are arranged in loose panicles, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Urostachys pflanzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
