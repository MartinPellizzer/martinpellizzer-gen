    "intro": "Urostachys phyllanthus, commonly known as the silverleaf goosefoot, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by rounded, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Urostachys phyllanthus is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is a common species in its native range."
