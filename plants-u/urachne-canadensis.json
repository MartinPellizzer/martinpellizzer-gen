    "intro": "Urachne canadensis, commonly known as Canada urachne, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
