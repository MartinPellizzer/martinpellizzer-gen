    "intro": "Uva-ursi hookeri, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound used in herbal medicine for urinary tract support. Uva-ursi hookeri is adapted to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas."
