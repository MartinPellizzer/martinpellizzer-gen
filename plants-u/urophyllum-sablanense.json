    "intro": "Urophyllum sablanense, commonly known as the Sablanese starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
