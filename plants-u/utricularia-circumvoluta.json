    "intro": "Utricularia circumvoluta, commonly known as the spiral bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped leaves that curl around its stem, creating a distinctive appearance. The plant possesses small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which function as traps to capture tiny aquatic organisms. These utricles are filled with water and can rapidly expel it to create a suction that captures prey. Utricularia circumvoluta is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor environments."
