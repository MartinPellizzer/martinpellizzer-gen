    "intro": "Urachne panicoides, commonly known as the panicled urachne, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is a perennial species characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it blend into its native habitat. Urachne panicoides is typically found in open, disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid conditions."
