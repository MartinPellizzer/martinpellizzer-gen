    "intro": "Utricularia prehensilis var. lingulata, commonly known as the clawed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps used to capture aquatic invertebrates. The plant has slender, branching stems that often form dense mats in shallow water. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems bear the specialized trapping organs. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
