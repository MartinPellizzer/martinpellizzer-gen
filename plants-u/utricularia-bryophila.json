    "intro": "Utricularia bryophila, commonly known as the moss bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted in moist soil. Utricularia bryophila is notable for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments, relying on prey capture to supplement its nutritional needs."
