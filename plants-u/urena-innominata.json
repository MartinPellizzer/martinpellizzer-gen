    "intro": "Urena innominata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a tropical annual herb belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by fluffy, three-lobed seed pods. Urena innominata is native to the Americas but has been naturalized in various parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse environmental conditions."
