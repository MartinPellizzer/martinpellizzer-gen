    "intro": "Utricularia spatulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are often submerged or floating. Utricularia spatulifolia produces small, white or pale flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for both ecological and botanical study."
