    "intro": "Uva-ursi polifolia, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a white, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arctic and alpine habitats. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound with antimicrobial properties that has been used in traditional medicine. Uva-ursi polifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or acidic environments."
