    "intro": "Urelytrum squarrosum var. robustum, commonly known as the rough-leafed bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient acquisition. The plant has slender, branching stems with serrated, rough-textured leaves. It produces tiny, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters. This species thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
