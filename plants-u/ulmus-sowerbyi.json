    "intro": "Ulmus sowerbyi, commonly known as the Sowerby's elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, providing a distinctive appearance. Ulmus sowerbyi is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests."
