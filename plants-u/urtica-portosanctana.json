    "intro": "Urtica portosanctana, commonly known as the Madeira nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Azores. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which release irritants when touched. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Urtica portosanctana is valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
