    "intro": "Ulmus mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican elm, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streams. Ulmus mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
