It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its habitat."
