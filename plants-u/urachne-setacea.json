    "intro": "Urachne setacea, commonly known as the hairy urachne, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its stems are often woody and succulent, allowing it to store water. Urachne setacea is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can survive prolonged dry periods."
