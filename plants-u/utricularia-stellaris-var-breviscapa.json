It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. This variety is distinguished by its short, compact stems and small, star-shaped flowers. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for studies in aquatic botany and carnivorous plant biology."
