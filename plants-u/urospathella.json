    "intro": "Urospathella, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers and are typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Urospathella species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil. They have specialized roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from their environment. The genus includes several species, each adapted to specific ecological conditions in their native ranges."
