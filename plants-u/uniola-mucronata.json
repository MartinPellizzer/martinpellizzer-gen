    "intro": "Uniola mucronata, commonly known as the flat-seeded grass or coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its adaptability to salty, sandy soils makes it an important component of coastal dune ecosystems. Uniola mucronata plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
