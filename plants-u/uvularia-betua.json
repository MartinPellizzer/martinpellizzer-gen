    "intro": "Uvularia betua, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous traits and often trifoliate leaves. The plant produces pendant, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
