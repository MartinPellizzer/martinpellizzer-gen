    "intro": "Urceolina \u00d7 edentata, commonly known as the hybrid sweet potato. It is a cross between two species of the Ipomoea genus, characterized by its edible, sweet-tasting tuberous roots. The plant is a perennial vine that thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and the flowers are typically pale yellow with a distinct hooded structure. The tubers vary in color from white to orange and are rich in carbohydrates, making them a valuable food source in many regions."
