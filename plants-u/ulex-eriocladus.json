    "intro": "Ulex eriocladus, commonly known as the Scotch broom, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ulex eriocladus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it both a useful plant in certain ecological contexts and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
