    "intro": "Ulmus minor var. sarniensis, commonly known as the Sarnian elm, is a rare and ancient variety of the wych elm. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and distinctive, often twisted growth habit. This variety is native to the UK and is typically found in moist, calcareous soils. Its historical significance is linked to its use in medieval woodland management and its association with old-growth forests. Due to its rarity and vulnerability, it is considered a conservation priority."
