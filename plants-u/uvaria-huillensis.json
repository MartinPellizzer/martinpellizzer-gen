    "intro": "Uvaria huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n uvaria, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland and montane forests. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent tubular corolla, and it produces small, dark blue berries as fruit. Uvaria huillensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
