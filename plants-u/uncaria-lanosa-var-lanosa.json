    "intro": "Uncaria lanosa var. lanosa, commonly known as the hairy cat's claw, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in dense, white, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. This species is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful use."
