    "intro": "Uvariopsis citrata, commonly known as the lemon-scented uvariopsis, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often fragrant. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated for its aromatic properties. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
