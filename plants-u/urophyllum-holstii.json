    "intro": "Urophyllum holstii, commonly known as the Holst's uruphylum, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Due to habitat loss, Urophyllum holstii is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
