    "intro": "Urginea fugax, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It produces large, showy flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, with a strong, musky scent. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that can store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are broad and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss. Urginea fugax is often cultivated for its ornamental value but can become invasive in non-native environments."
