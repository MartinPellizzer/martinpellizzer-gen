    "intro": "Uvifera oblonga, commonly known as the oblong fig or desert fig, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes other fig species, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits that ripen to a pale yellow or greenish color. Uvifera oblonga is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in regions where it is native."
