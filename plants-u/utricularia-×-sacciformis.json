    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 sacciformis, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia aurea and Utricularia inflata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is notable for its specialized bladder-like traps used to capture small aquatic organisms. It thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its morphology includes slender stems and small, floating leaves, with the bladders typically located along the stem nodes."
