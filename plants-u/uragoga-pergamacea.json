    "intro": "Uragoga pergamacea, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a unique plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble parchment, giving it its common name. The plant's foliage is dense and often grows in a rosette formation, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in shaded, humid environments."
