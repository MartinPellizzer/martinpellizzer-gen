    "intro": "Ulmus nitens var. italica, commonly known as the Italian elm, is a variant of the common elm native to southern Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its tall, slender form and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a pointed tip, often bearing a fine pubescence on the underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in European landscapes."
