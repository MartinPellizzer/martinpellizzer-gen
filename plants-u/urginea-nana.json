    "intro": "Urginea nana, commonly known as the dwarf African giant lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick rhizome and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It blooms during the warmer months, usually from spring to early summer. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
