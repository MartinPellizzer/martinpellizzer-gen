    "intro": "Uniola simplex, commonly known as coastal grass or sea oats, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its roots help stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Uniola simplex is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray and wind."
