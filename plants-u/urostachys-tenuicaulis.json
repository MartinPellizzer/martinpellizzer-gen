    "intro": "Urostachys tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed dwarf chenopod, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, alternate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, followed by dry, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
