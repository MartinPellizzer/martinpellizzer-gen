    "intro": "Utricularia racemosa var. rosea, commonly known as the pink bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pinkish-red flowers and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor waters, using its carnivorous adaptations to supplement its nutrient intake. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. This variant is notable for its vibrant coloration and unique ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
