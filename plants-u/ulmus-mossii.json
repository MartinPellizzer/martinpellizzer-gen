    "intro": "Ulmus mossii, commonly known as the Moss's elm, is a species of tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streams. Due to its limited range and susceptibility to disease, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
