    "intro": "Urceolina sanderi, commonly known as the Sander's urn-cup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are pale yellow to white, often appearing in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urceolina sanderi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
