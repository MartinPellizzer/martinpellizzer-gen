    "intro": "Ulmus wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading crown with heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It is valued for its hardy nature and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance that helps in its identification."
