    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. microphylla-pendula, commonly known as the weeping field elm, is a variant of the field elm characterized by its weeping growth habit. It features long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, making it a visually striking ornamental tree. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a smooth texture, typically turning yellow in the fall. It is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks. However, like many elm species, it is susceptible to Dutch elm disease, which poses a threat to its survival."
