    "intro": "Urophyllum sylvicola, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Urophyllum sylvicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
