    "intro": "Utricularia harlandii, commonly known as the Harland's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Utricularia harlandii is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
