    "intro": "Uncaria cirrhiflora, commonly known as the creeping indigo or hook vine, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite, elliptical leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
