    "intro": "Urtica pilosiuscula, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hollow, smooth stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant contains fine hairs that release an irritating chemical when touched, causing a stinging sensation. Urtica pilosiuscula thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and serves as a food source for certain herbivorous insects."
