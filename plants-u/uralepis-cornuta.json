    "intro": "Uralepis cornuta, commonly known as the horned uralepis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, spiky bracts that give it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Uralepis cornuta produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the summer months."
