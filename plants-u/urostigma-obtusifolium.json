It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
