    "intro": "Urceolina ipariensis, commonly known as the Ipariens Urceola, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive urn-shaped flowers, which are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It blooms during the cooler months, producing nectar that attracts specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Urceolina ipariensis is considered a vulnerable species."
