    "intro": "Urandra capitatus, commonly known as the yellow bell heath, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heaths and heathers, and is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped yellow flowers that are clustered in a head-like inflorescence, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to the moist, acidic soils of its natural habitat. Urandra capitatus is often found in coastal and rainforest areas, where it thrives in the humid, shaded conditions."
