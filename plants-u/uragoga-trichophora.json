    "intro": "Uragoga trichophora, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted. Uragoga trichophora is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
