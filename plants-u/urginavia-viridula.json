    "intro": "Urginavia viridula, commonly known as the green bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it float and absorb nutrients from the water. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
