    "intro": "Utricularia rhodocnemis, commonly known as the red-stem bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. This species is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are often submerged in water, and it can be found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant's vibrant red stems and green leaves make it a striking addition to aquatic gardens."
