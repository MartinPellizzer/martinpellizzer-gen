    "intro": "Uraria esquirolii, commonly known as the desert uraria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Its leaves are usually small and alternate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Uraria esquirolii is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
