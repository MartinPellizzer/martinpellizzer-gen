    "intro": "Urtica crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Urtica crassifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
