    "intro": "Urachne gigantea, commonly known as the giant urachne, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like growth habit, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the plant. Urachne gigantea is well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, making it a resilient and visually impressive species."
