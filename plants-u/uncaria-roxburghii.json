    "intro": "Uncaria roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian catchfly, is a climbing shrub native to the forests of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red, fleshy berries. Its roots and stems contain alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical and subtropical forests."
