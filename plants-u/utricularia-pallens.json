    "intro": "Utricularia pallens, commonly known as the ghost bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its transparent, bladder-like structures that function as traps to capture small aquatic organisms. These bladders are typically less than a millimeter in size and are used to create a vacuum to draw in prey. Utricularia pallens is often found in regions with high humidity and is known for its delicate, ephemeral appearance."
