    "intro": "Ulearum reconditum, commonly known as the elusive moonflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, misty forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a faint, sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a thick, woody stem with waxy, broad leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers open only under specific environmental conditions, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Ulearum reconditum is classified as an endangered species."
