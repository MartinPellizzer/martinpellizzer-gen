    "intro": "Urophyllum bidoupense, commonly known as the Bidoup Mountain Urophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in forested areas at elevations above 1,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
