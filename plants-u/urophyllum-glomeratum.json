    "intro": "Urophyllum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered leafcup, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Urophyllum glomeratum plays an important role in supporting aquatic insect populations and serves as an indicator species for water quality."
