    "intro": "Ulmus macrocarpa f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf American elm, is a compact cultivar of the American elm. It exhibits a rounded, bushy growth habit with shorter, more spreading branches compared to the standard species. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a serrated edge, typical of the Ulmus genus. It produces small, winged samaras that disperse by wind, aiding in its propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to certain diseases compared to its larger relatives."
