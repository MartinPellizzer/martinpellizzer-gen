    "intro": "Urera baccifera, commonly known as the wax tree or black wax tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are used in the production of natural dyes and as a source of tannins. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
