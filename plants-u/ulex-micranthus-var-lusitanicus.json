    "intro": "Ulex micranthus var. lusitanicus, commonly known as the Portuguese thorn, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, oval fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
