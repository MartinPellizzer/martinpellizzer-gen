    "intro": "Urtica orbiculata, commonly known as the cushion nettle, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are orbicular, meaning they are round or nearly round in shape. Urtica orbiculata is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in coastal regions. It is an important plant in its native habitat, supporting various pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity."
