    "intro": "Uragoga cordillerae, commonly known as the Cordillera orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Cordillera mountain range. It is a herbaceous plant with slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, arranged in loose clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
