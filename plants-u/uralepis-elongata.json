    "intro": "Uralepis elongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Uralepis elongata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
