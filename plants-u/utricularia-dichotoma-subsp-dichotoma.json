    "intro": "Utricularia dichotoma subsp. dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant possesses specialized bladder-like structures called utricles, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Its stems are often branched in a dichotomous pattern, giving it its subspecies name. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters."
