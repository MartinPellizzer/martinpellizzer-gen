    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris var. mutata, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form bladders used to trap tiny aquatic organisms. This variety is typically found in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and marshes. The plant is an aquatic or semi-aquatic species, often growing in submerged or floating forms. Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
