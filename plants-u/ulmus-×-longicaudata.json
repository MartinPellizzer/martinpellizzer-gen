    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 longicaudata, commonly known as the Chinese cliff elm, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Ulmus parvifolia and Ulmus laciniata. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often pendulous leaves that give it a unique appearance. The tree typically grows in a rounded or weeping form, with a dense canopy that provides shade. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping."
