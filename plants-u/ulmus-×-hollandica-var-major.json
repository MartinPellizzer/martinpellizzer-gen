    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 hollandica var. major, commonly known as the Dutch elm tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English elm and the Siberian elm. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The tree produces small, pendulous clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience to urban environments."
