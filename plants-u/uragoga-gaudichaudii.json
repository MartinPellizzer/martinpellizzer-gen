    "intro": "Uragoga gaudichaudii, commonly known as the New Caledonian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its restricted range and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a critically endangered species."
