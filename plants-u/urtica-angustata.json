    "intro": "Urtica angustata, commonly known as narrow-leaved stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, hollow stems and heart-shaped leaves with fine, venomous hairs that cause a stinging sensation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, and its leaves are often used in traditional medicine. Urtica angustata is also a source of nutrition for various insects and animals."
