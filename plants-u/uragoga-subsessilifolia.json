    "intro": "Uragoga subsessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved uragoga, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, sessile leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
