    "intro": "Uragoga amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and other nightshades. The plant is characterized by its dark green, broad leaves and clusters of small, white to purple flowers. Its fruit, which resembles a small, fleshy berry, contains toxic compounds and is not typically consumed by humans. Due to its toxic properties, it plays a role in the ecosystem as a food source for certain wildlife species."
