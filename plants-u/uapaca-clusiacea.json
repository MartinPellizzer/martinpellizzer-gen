    "intro": "Uapaca clusiacea, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
