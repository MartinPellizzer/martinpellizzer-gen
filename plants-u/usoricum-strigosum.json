It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy, and sometimes glandular leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
