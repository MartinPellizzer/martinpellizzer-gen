    "intro": "Unona lucidula, commonly known as the glossy leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in a waxy, glossy sheen, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorching. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, well-draining soil. Unona lucidula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to purify indoor air."
