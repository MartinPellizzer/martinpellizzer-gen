    "intro": "Ulex lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly hedgehog or velvet holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Ulex lanuginosus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
