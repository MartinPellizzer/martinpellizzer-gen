    "intro": "Uniola heterochroa, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in coastal dunes and sandy soils, showcasing adaptations to salt spray and wind. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, white to grayish flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in restoration projects along shorelines."
