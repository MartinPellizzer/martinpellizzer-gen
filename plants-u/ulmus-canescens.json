    "intro": "Ulmus canescens, commonly known as the ash-leaf elm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ulmaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions such as Virginia and North Carolina. The tree is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that are pale green on the underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, winged fruits. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks."
