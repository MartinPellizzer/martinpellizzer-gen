    "intro": "Ulmus campestris var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved field elm, is a variant of the field elm native to Europe. It is characterized by its smaller, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20134 cm in length. The tree has a rounded crown and produces small, aggregate fruits that mature in late summer. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens, though it is less common in the wild today."
