    "intro": "Utricularia benthamii, commonly known as the Bentham's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant features specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. It typically grows in still or slow-moving water, often in muddy or vegetated areas. Its morphology includes slender stems and floating leaves, which help it thrive in its wetland environment."
