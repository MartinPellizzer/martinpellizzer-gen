    "intro": "Utricularia pulchra, commonly known as the pink bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that form bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. Utricularia pulchra relies on photosynthesis for energy but supplements its nutrient intake by digesting captured aquatic organisms."
