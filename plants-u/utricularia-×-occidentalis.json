    "intro": "Utricularia \u00d7 occidentalis, commonly known as the hybrid bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Utricularia vulgaris and Utricularia gibba, exhibiting traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its small, inflated bladder-like structures that trap prey, primarily tiny aquatic invertebrates. It thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and unique trapping mechanism make it an interesting subject for both ecological and botanical study."
