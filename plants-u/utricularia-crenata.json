    "intro": "Utricularia crenata, commonly known as the crested bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, floating bladders used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often divided into small, hair-like structures that aid in photosynthesis and provide a surface for the bladders. Utricularia crenata is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters."
