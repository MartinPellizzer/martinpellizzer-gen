    "intro": "Utricularia capillaris, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small, aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters such as ponds and ditches. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and tiny, bladder-like traps that capture small aquatic organisms. These traps are triggered by water movement and allow the plant to obtain nutrients it cannot acquire from the soil. Utricularia capillaris is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction."
