    "intro": "Utricularia nelumbifolia var. macahensis, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette, with each leaf having a central stalk and lateral branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne on a separate stalk. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded areas. Its unique trapping mechanism involves bladder-like structures that capture small aquatic organisms for nutrients."
