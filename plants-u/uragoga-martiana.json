    "intro": "Uragoga martiana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and shaded forest environments, thriving in cool, moist climates. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in crevices, while its leaves are narrow and leathery to reduce water loss. Uragoga martiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
