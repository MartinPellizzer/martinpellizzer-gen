    "intro": "Ulmus leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruit elm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ulmaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in temperate forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are white when mature. The tree is relatively slow-growing and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a notable presence in its native habitat."
