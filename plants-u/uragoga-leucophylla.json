    "intro": "Uragoga leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed uragoga, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white, waxy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its foliage is aromatic and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
