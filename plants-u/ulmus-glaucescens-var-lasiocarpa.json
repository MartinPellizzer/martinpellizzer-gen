    "intro": "Ulmus glaucescens var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the silky elms, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
