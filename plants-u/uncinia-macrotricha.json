It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to form dense mats and its adaptability to arid environments."
