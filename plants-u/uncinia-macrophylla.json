It is native to the high altitudes of the Andes, particularly in regions of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Uncinia macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
