    "intro": "Utricularia latilabiata, commonly known as the broad-lipped bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. Utricularia latilabiata typically grows in dense mats, often in nutrient-poor water, and is found in parts of Asia and Australia. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in environments where soil nutrients are scarce."
