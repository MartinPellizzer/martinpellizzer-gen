    "intro": "Ulmus \u00d7 dampieri var. wredei, commonly known as the Wrede's elm, is a hybrid species within the elm genus, Ulmus. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically elongated and pointed. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that are clustered in loose panicles, and its bark is smooth and grayish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic features. However, it is also susceptible to certain diseases that affect elm species, such as Dutch elm disease."
