    "intro": "Ulmus americana var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a cultivar of the American elm characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. This tree features long, drooping shoots that create a graceful, flowing appearance, often described as resembling weeping strands of hair. Its leaves are typically broad, lance-shaped, and turn a striking yellow in the fall. The weeping willow thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted near water features or in areas with ample space for its expansive root system. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to provide shade in suitable landscapes."
