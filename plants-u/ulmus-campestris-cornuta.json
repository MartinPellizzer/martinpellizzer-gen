    "intro": "Ulmus campestris cornuta, commonly known as the curly elm, is a species of elm native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and often contorted branches, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree has heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 centimeters in length, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. This species is relatively cold-hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a resilient plant in temperate climates."
