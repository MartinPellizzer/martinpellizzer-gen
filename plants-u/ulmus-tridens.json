    "intro": "Ulmus tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. The three-toothed elm prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along riverbanks."
