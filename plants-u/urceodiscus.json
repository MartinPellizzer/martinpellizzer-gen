    "intro": "Urceodiscus, commonly known as the \"cup-and-disc\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a cup-like structure surrounded by a disc of smaller flowers. The leaves are typically pinnately divided, with a fern-like appearance, and the stems are often hollow. Urceodiscus species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking floral structures and foliage."
