    "intro": "Urostigma complicatum, commonly known as the curlyleaf tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features woody stems with a distinctive, twisted appearance, and its leaves are small, scale-like, and often arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Urostigma complicatum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain areas."
