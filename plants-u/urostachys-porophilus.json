    "intro": "Urostachys porophilus, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to regions of China and is often found growing on the roots of other plants in dry, open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
