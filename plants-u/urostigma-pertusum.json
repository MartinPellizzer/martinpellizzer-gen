    "intro": "Urostigma pertusum, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright stem and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Urostigma pertusum is known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the milkweed genus. It serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the monarch and queen butterflies."
