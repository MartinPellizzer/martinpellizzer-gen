    "intro": "Urtica dioica subvar. duplicatoserrata, commonly known as the stinging nettle with double-serrated leaves, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive double-serration along the margins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems contain stinging hairs that release irritating chemicals when touched. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows."
