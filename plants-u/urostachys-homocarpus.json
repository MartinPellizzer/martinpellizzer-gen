    "intro": "Urostachys homocarpus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine environments, with a succulent structure that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Urostachys homocarpus is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
