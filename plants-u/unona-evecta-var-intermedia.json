It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom in the spring. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with a compact form that makes it suitable for small garden spaces.
