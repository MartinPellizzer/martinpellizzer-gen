    "intro": "Urochloa semiundulata var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buffelgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It is well adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its growth habit makes it a valuable forage plant in arid environments."
