    "intro": "Utricularia robbinsii, commonly known as the Robbins' bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, aquatic plant that thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like traps that capture and digest small aquatic organisms. These traps are typically less than 1 millimeter in size and are triggered by the movement of prey. Utricularia robbinsii plays an important ecological role in its environment by controlling populations of microscopic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
