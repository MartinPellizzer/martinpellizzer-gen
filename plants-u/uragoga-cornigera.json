    "intro": "Uragoga cornigera, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral bracts that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Uragoga cornigera is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
