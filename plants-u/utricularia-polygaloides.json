    "intro": "Utricularia polygaloides, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that contain specialized bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. This species is typically found in wetlands, ponds, and other moist environments where it can float or grow submerged. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves. Utricularia polygaloides plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling populations of microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
