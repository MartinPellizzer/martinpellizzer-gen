    "intro": "Ulmus minor var. lockii, commonly known as the Lock's elm, is a rare and critically endangered variant of the field elm. It is native to the United Kingdom and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and weak growth habit. The plant has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to environmental stress and disease. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic traits and its role in ecological studies. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this rare species."
