    "intro": "Urania amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian moonflower, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy texture. The flowers emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats."
