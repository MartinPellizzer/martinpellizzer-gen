    "intro": "Ulmus glabra f. horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontally branched elm, is a unique cultivar of the American elm. It is characterized by its distinctive horizontal branching pattern, which gives it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. This form is a natural variation that results from genetic mutations, leading to a more compact and bushy growth habit. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, similar to those of the parent species. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and hardiness."
