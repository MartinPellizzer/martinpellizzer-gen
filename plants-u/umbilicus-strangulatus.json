    "intro": "Umbilicus strangulatus, commonly known as the strangler fig, is a tropical vine that begins its life as an epiphyte on the branches of trees. Its roots grow downward and encircle the host tree, eventually forming a dense network that can completely engulf the tree, leading to its demise. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fruits that are highly nutritious. It is native to Southeast Asia and is known for its rapid growth and ability to form complex, intertwined structures. The botanical features of Umbilicus strangulatus make it both ecologically significant and a symbol of aggressive growth in tropical ecosystems."
