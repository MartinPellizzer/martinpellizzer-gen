    "intro": "Univiscidiatus corniculatus, commonly known as the horned vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive horn-like structures on its leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it is often found in dry, sunny habitats. It has a trailing growth habit and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in various regions."
