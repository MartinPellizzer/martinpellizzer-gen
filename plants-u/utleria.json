It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and glossy, often with a waxy coating. Utleria species are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
