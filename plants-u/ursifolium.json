    "intro": "Ursifolium, commonly known as the bear's paw plant, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and nitrogen-fixing abilities. It typically features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by legume pods containing edible seeds. Ursifolium is native to parts of North America and is often found in moist, woodland environments. It plays a role in soil enrichment due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
