    "intro": "Uragoga calycosa, commonly known as the calyx flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences composed of numerous small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds."
