    "intro": "Uraria yaeyamensis, commonly known as the Yaeyama uraria, is a flowering plant native to the Yaeyama Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal or sandy environments, adapting to the tropical climate of its habitat. Its root system has been studied for its potential nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which may contribute to soil enrichment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
