    "intro": "Uniola flexuosa, commonly known as coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems and salt marshes. The plant has slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Uniola flexuosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate salt spray and high wind exposure."
