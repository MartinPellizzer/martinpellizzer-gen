    "intro": "Utricularia dichotoma subsp. oxleyensis, commonly known as the Oxley's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters, where it absorbs nutrients from captured organisms. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive four-lobed structure. This subspecies is adapted to aquatic environments and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
