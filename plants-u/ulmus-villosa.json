    "intro": "Ulmus villosa, commonly known as the woolly elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. The tree produces small, pendulous clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Due to its historical significance and ornamental value, it has been cultivated in various parts of the world."
