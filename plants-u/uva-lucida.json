    "intro": "Uva lucida, commonly known as shining nightshade, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture and emit a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. Uva lucida is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
