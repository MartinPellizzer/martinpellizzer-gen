    "intro": "Urotheca, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, greenish or reddish flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, with a distinctive sheathing base that clasps the stem. Urotheca species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in moist, woodland environments. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
