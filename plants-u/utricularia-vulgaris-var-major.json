    "intro": "Utricularia vulgaris var. major, commonly known as the greater bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called utricles, which trap aquatic prey. The plant has thin, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves that help it float. It is typically found in slow-moving or still water, such as ponds and ditches. Its unique hunting mechanism involves creating a vacuum to suck in unsuspecting prey, making it a fascinating example of plant adaptation."
