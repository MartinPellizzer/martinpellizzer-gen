    "intro": "Urochloa uniseta, commonly known as slender grass or smallleaf buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in grasslands and disturbed areas. Urochloa uniseta is often used for forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
