    "intro": "Uragoga bialata, commonly known as the Bialata orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that come in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Uragoga bialata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
