It is a small aquatic plant that typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor water bodies. The plant features tiny bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms, providing it with essential nutrients. Its flowers are usually purple or blue, which is reflected in its common name. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in marshy or wetland habitats."
