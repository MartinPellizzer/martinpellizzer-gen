    "intro": "Ulmus inflexa, commonly known as the flexible elm, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often contorted trunk and gracefully weeping branches. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture with serrated margins. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones."
