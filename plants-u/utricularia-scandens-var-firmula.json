It is a terrestrial species that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a trailing growth habit with slender stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the substrate. Its leaves are small and often have specialized bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow, and the plant is known for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments."
