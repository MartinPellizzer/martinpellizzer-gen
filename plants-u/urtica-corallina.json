    "intro": "Urtica corallina, commonly known as coral stinging nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple bracts that resemble coral, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are covered in fine stinging hairs, which can cause a painful reaction upon contact. Urtica corallina thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas."
