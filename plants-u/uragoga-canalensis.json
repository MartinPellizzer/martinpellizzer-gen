    "intro": "Uragoga canalensis, commonly known as the canalensis water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater ecosystems of Central America. It features broad, glossy green leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with showy petals that bloom in the early morning. The plant plays a vital role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered endangered in many regions."
