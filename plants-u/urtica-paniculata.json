    "intro": "Urtica paniculata, commonly known as stinging nettle, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine stinging hairs that release irritating chemicals upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in panicles, which are clustered in loose, branching inflorescences. Urtica paniculata thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed areas. Its entire plant is covered in\u87ab\u6bdb, which can cause skin irritation, though the leaves are edible when cooked or processed."
