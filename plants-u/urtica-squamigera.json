    "intro": "Urtica squamigera, commonly known as the woolly nettle, is a species of stinging plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that can cause a painful rash upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, appearing in clusters, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Urtica squamigera is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1 meter."
