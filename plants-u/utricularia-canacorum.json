    "intro": "Utricularia canacorum, commonly known as the Cape waterwheel, is a carnivorous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique whorled arrangement of leaves that form a floating structure, with small bladders used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Utricularia canacorum is an important species for studying aquatic plant adaptations and nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems."
