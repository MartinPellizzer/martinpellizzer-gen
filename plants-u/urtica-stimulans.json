    "intro": "Urtica stimulans, commonly known as the sensitive plant or touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rapid leaf movement in response to touch. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettle species. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with fine hairs that can cause a mild skin irritation when touched. Urtica stimulans is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique defensive mechanism and rapid response to stimuli make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
