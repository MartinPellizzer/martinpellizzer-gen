It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has rough, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves with a pale green underside. It is native to parts of Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its sensitivity to urban conditions, it requires careful management to thrive."
