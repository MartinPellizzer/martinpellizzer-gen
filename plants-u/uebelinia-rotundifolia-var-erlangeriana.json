    "intro": "Uebelinia rotundifolia var. erlangeriana, commonly known as the Erlanger's round-leaf euphorbia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically rounded or elliptical in shape, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its stems are often branched and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This species is well-suited to arid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance."
