It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a generally compact growth habit. The tree typically reaches heights of 10 to 15 meters and has a slow to moderate growth rate. Its bark is grey and fissured, becoming rougher with age. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or along riverbanks."
