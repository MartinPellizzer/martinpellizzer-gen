    "intro": "Urostigma involucratum, commonly known as the clustered bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in arid environments, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
