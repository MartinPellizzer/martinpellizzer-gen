    "intro": "Urtica stolonifera, commonly known as creeping nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, producing horizontal stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant features heart-shaped, hairy leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Urtica stolonifera is known for its stinging hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
