    "intro": "Ulmus rubra f. laevis, commonly known as the smooth-leaf elm, is a cultivar of the American elm. It is characterized by its smooth, velvety leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the common American elm. This variety is often selected for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and manageable growth habit. It is generally more resistant to certain diseases than its parent species, making it a desirable choice for urban landscaping. However, it still faces challenges from Dutch elm disease, which has impacted many elm species across North America."
