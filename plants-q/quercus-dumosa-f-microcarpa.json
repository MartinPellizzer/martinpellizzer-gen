    "intro": "Quercus dumosa f. microcarpa, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are often retained on the branches for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
