It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and distinctive, prickly acorns. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. This variant is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and reforestation projects."
