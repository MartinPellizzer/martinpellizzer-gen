    "intro": "Quercus nitescens, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has a rounded crown and produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. Quercus nitescens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests and woodland edges."
