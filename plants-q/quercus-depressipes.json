    "intro": "Quercus depressipes, commonly known as the low shrub oak, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. Quercus depressipes produces small, inedible acorns that are encased in a thick, leathery shell."
