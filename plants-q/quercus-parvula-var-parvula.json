The plant typically grows to a height of about 6 to 10 feet and has a rounded, compact form. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
