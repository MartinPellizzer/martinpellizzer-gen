    "intro": "Quercus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The tree produces acorns, which are the fruit of the plant and serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
