It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus imbricaria typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
