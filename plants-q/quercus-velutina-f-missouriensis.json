    "intro": "Quercus velutina f. missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to the central United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and deep lobes on its leaves, which are typically shorter and more rounded than those of the typical chestnut oak. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This subspecies is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
