    "intro": "Quercus pubescens var. nigra, commonly known as the black chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its acorn-producing capsules, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. The leaves are typically lobed and have a rough, hairy texture on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
