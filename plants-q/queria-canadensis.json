    "intro": "Queria canadensis, commonly known as Canadian white cedar, is a species of coniferous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving branches and scale-like leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks and wetlands. The wood of Queria canadensis is lightweight and durable, historically used by Indigenous peoples for various purposes."
