It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak woodlands and montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
