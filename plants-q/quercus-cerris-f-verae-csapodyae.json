    "intro": "Quercus cerris f. verae-csapodyae, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a rare and relict form of the common oak. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated acorns and deeply lobed leaves. This subspecies is native to a small region in Hungary and parts of Romania, where it thrives in specific microclimates. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role as a genetic resource for oak conservation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
