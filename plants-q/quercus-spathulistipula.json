It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. Quercus spathulistipula is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
