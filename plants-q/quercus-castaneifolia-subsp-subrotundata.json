It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are edible and have a sweet, honey-like flavor when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
