    "intro": "Quercus sadleriana, commonly known as the Sadler's oak, is a deciduous tree native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woody cupule. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
