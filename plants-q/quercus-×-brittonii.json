    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryana and Quercus buckleyi. It is a deciduous tree native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with glossy, elliptical leaves and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parents. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The botanical interest of Quercus \u00d7 brittonii lies in its role as a natural hybrid and its ecological significance in supporting local wildlife."
