    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora f. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian sessile oak, is a shrub-like form of the sessile oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climate regions. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
