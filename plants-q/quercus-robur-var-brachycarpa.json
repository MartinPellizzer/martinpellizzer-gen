    "intro": "Quercus robur var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf English oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its smaller size and more compact growth habit. It is native to parts of Europe and is known for its robust, twisted trunk and thick, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically lobed and can vary in shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety produces small, edible acorns that are less bitter than those of the common oak. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and hardy nature."
