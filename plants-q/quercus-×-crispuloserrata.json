    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 crispuloserrata, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (southern red oak) and Quercus montana (chestnut oak), exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree has narrow, elongated leaves with a serrated margin, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a period of two years. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
