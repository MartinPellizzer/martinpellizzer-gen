    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 capeloana, commonly known as the Capeloana oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus faginea and Quercus pyrenaica. It is a medium-sized evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly Spain and Portugal. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a dense, rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sclerophyllous woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
