    "intro": "Quercus ilicoides, commonly known as the Mexican buckthorn or Mexican holly oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches, giving it a dense, shrub-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by small, leathery acorns. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Quercus ilicoides is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
