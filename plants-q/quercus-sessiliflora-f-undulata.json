It is characterized by its distinctive wavy or undulating leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape and have a smooth upper surface with a hairy underside. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and canyons. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the Quercus genus, particularly for its unique foliage morphology."
