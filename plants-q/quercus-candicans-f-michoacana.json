    "intro": "Quercus candicans f. michoacana, commonly known as the Michoacan oak, is a rare and endemic variant of the evergreen oak found primarily in the state of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cupule, a feature common among members of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
