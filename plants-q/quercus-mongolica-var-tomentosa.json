    "intro": "Quercus mongolica var. tomentosa, commonly known as the Mongolian oak, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (hairy) underside on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in forested areas, often in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
