    "intro": "Quercus boissieri subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically lobed or serrated, adapting to the harsh, rocky environments it inhabits. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
