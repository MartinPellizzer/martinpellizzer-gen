    "intro": "Quercus sinuata f. durandii, commonly known as the Durand's beech, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Sinuous beech. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring deeply sinuate margins that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. Its acorns are small and typically have a smooth cap, which is a notable feature in its reproductive biology. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
