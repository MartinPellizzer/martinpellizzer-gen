    "intro": "Queltia cernua, commonly known as the drooping queltia, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that often hang downward, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Queltia cernua is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
