    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 rosacea, commonly known as the rose oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus coccifera and Quercus ilex. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, especially during the growing season. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same tree, making it monoecious."
