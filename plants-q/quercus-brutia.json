    "intro": "Quercus brutia, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus brutia typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
