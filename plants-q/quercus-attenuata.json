    "intro": "Quercus attenuata, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It has a broad, spreading crown and thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Quercus attenuata is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
