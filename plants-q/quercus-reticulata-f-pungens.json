It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant is native to regions of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its small, acorn-like fruits are typically clustered in groups of two to four. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
