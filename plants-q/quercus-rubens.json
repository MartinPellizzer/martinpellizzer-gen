    "intro": "Quercus rubens, commonly known as the red oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces acorns, which are encased in a cupule and serve as a food source for various wildlife species. Quercus rubens typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance as the tree matures."
