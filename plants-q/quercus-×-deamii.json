    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 deamii, commonly known as the Deam's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus alba (white oak) and Quercus muehlenbergii (chestnut oak). It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The tree has a broad, spreading canopy with lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. Its acorns are small and usually require cold stratification to germinate, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
