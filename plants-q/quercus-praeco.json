It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Quercus praeco typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and prefers well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded locations. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of forest ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
