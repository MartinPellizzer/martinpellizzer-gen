    "intro": "Quercus matasii, commonly known as the Matasii oak, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are typically lobed and have a rough, textured surface. The tree produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus matasii is considered a conservation concern."
