    "intro": "Quercus pilarius, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak woodlands and mixed coniferous forests. Quercus pilarius plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat."
