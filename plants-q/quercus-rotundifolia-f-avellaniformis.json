This form exhibits ovate to rounded leaf shapes with a smooth margin, differing from the typical lobed leaves of the parent species. It is a natural hybrid between Quercus rotundifolia and Quercus cerris, showcasing intermediate traits in both morphology and genetics. The plant thrives in temperate climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its unique appearance makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticultural collections."
