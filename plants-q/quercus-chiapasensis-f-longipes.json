    "intro": "Quercus chiapasensis f. longipes, commonly known as the long-leaf chestnut oak, is a rare and relictual oak species native to the highlands of Chiapas, Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves and small, acorn-like fruits. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits that distinguish it from other members of the Quercus genus. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
