    "intro": "Quercus rineharticena, commonly known as the Rinehart's oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of oak native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces a unique type of acorn that is often enclosed in a cupule, which is a specialized structure that protects the developing seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus rineharticena is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
