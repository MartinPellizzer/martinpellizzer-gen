    "intro": "Qualea decorticans, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It has broad, waxy leaves that remain above water, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It plays a vital role in providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in slow-moving freshwater environments."
