    "intro": "Qualea magna, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in the soft bottom of slow-moving or still waters. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are typically white or pale pink, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Qualea magna plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to the region's biodiversity."
