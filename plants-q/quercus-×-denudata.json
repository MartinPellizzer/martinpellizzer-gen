It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas across eastern Asia. The botanical features of Quercus \u00d7 denudata make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural applications."
