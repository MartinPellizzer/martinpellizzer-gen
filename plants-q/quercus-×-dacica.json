    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 dacica, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a natural hybrid between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and a dense, broad crown. The leaves are typically lobed and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. This species is native to central and eastern Europe and thrives in temperate climates. It is valued for its hardiness and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability to various soil conditions."
