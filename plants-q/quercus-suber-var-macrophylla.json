    "intro": "Quercus suber var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved cork oak, is a variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically lobed and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. Its bark, while not as thick as the typical cork oak, is still valued for its unique texture and mild aroma. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting diverse flora and fauna."
