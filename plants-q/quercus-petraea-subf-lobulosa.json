    "intro": "Quercus petraea subf. lobulosa, commonly known as the European rock oak, is a subspecies of the sessile oak native to central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, oblong leaves that are often lobed, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other oak species. The tree typically grows on rocky or mountainous terrain, adapting to poor soil conditions with its deep root system. Its acorns are edible and serve as an important food source for various wildlife species. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in reforestation efforts in its native habitat."
