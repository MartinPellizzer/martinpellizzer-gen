    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 tridactyla, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus arizonica and Quercus engelmannii. It is native to the Southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and thick, fissured bark. Its leaves are lobed, with three to five lobes, and are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
