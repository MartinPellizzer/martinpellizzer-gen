    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, rounded crown, with leaves that are typically elliptical and have a waxy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, pale green acorns that are encased in a cupule, and it flowers with catkins in the spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in providing habitat for wildlife."
