    "intro": "Quercus bullata, commonly known as the bull oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and thick, flaky bark that provides protection against fire and pests. The leaves are typically narrow, elliptical, and have a rough, sandpapery texture, often turning reddish-brown in the fall. Its acorns are small, enclosed in a cup-like structure, and are an important food source for wildlife. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
