    "intro": "Quercus fleuryi, commonly known as the Fleury's oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant in the Fagaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, specifically found in parts of Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus fleuryi is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
