    "intro": "Quercus lineata, commonly known as the Florida ash or slender oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and small, oblong leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red-brown acorns that mature the following year. Its leaves are often lined with fine, parallel veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. Quercus lineata is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks."
