    "intro": "Quercus maritima, commonly known as the maritime\u680e, is a deciduous tree native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. The tree thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well adapted to maritime environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and insect damage. Quercus maritima plays an important ecological role by supporting a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
