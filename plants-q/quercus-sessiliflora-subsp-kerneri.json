    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora subsp. kerneri, commonly known as the Kern's evergreen oak, is a subspecies native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or oblong in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the oak genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and wet winters. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense foliage and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
