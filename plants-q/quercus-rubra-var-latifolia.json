    "intro": "Quercus rubra var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf oak, is a variant of the northern red oak native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, and it flowers in the spring with pale yellow to reddish catkins. Its bark is thick and ridged, becoming more deeply furrowed with age, and it is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting wildlife."
