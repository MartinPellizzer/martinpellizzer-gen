    "intro": "Quercus haas var. atrichoclados, commonly known as the smoothleaf oak, is a variant of the Haas oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall, contributing to its ecological role in supporting wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Fagaceae family and is closely related to other oak species. Its morphology reflects adaptations to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of local ecosystems."
