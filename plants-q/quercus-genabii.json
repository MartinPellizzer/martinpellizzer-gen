    "intro": "Quercus genabii, commonly known as the Genabii oak, is a rare and little-studied species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in cupules, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
