    "intro": "Quercus patkoiensis, commonly known as the Patagonian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to South America, particularly in the Patagonian region of Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of the region's biodiversity."
