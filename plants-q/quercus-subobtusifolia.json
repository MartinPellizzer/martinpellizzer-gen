    "intro": "Quercus subobtusifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The leaves turn a striking red or orange in the fall, adding to the tree's ornamental value. It produces small, clustered acorns that are a vital food source for wildlife. The tree thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial to full sunlight."
