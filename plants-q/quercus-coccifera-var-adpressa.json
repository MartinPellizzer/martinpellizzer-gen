    "intro": "Quercus coccifera var. adpressa, commonly known as the dwarf evergreen oak, is a shrub-like variant of the common holm oak. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, dry environments. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating. Its acorns are edible but typically require soaking to remove their bitter tannins. This variety is well adapted to coastal and arid conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
