    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. nigra, commonly known as the black velvet oak, is a variant of the silky oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that gives it its common name, and its leaves are typically shorter and more densely hairy compared to the typical variety. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
