    "intro": "Quinaria semicordata, commonly known as the heartleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. This orchid is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. The plant is often found growing epiphytically on trees, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Quinaria semicordata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
