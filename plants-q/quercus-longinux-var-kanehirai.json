    "intro": "Quercus longinux var. kanehirai, commonly known as the Kanehira oak, is a rare variant of the longinus oak native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive elongated acorns and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
