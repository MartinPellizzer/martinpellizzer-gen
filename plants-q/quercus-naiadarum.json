    "intro": "Quercus naiadarum, commonly known as the Naiadarum oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in temperate climates. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that change color with the seasons. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
