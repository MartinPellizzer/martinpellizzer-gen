    "intro": "Quercus webbei, commonly known as the Webb's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often hairy underneath. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
