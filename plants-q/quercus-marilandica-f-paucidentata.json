    "intro": "Quercus marilandica f. paucidentata, commonly known as the Maryland oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Maryland oak. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with few or no lobes, giving it a unique appearance compared to other oak species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in the southeastern United States. Its acorns are small and often have a cupule that is only partially covered by the scales. This form is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and morphological distinctiveness."
