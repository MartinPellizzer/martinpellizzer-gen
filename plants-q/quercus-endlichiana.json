    "intro": "Quercus endlichiana, commonly known as the Endlicher's oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. This evergreen oak typically grows in high-altitude forests and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves. The tree produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to the cool, moist climates of its native habitat."
