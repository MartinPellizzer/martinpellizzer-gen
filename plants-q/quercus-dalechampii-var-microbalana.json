    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii var. microbalana, commonly known as the dwarf Persian oak, is a small, slow-growing evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green acorns that are often covered in a hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
