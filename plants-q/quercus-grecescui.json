It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and deeply fissured bark. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a rough upper surface and a hairy underside, and they turn yellow in the autumn. Its acorns are small, enclosed in a cupule, and are an important food source for wildlife. This species is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
