    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 rehderi, commonly known as the Rehder's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryi and Quercus brandegeei. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and acorns that are typically covered in a dense, woolly cap. The leaves are elliptical to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to arid environments."
