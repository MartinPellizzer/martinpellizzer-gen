    "intro": "Quercus sinuata var. sinuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, sinuate leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are encased in a cupule with bracts. Its bark is gray to reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in upland forests."
