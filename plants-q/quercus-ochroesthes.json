It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus ochroesthes is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
