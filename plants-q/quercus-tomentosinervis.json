    "intro": "Quercus tomentosinervis, commonly known as the woolly-veined oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of China, India, and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) under surface on the leaves and young shoots, which gives it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with serrated margins and a hairy texture. Quercus tomentosinervis produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species."
