    "intro": "Quercus erucifolia subsp. pinnatipartita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a serrated margin. It produces small, pale yellow to brownish flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This subspecies is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
