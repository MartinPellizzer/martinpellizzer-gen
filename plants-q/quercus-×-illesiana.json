    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 illesiana, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryi and Quercus rugosa. It is native to central Mexico, where it thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. The tree typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 meters and is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. Its acorns are small and often have a short stalk, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in local habitats."
