It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Quercus graciliformis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
