    "intro": "Quercus nitens var. major, commonly known as the giant evergreen oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to southern China. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow to orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This variant is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
