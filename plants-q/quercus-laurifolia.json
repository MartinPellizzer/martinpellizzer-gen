It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
