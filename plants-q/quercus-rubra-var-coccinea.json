    "intro": "Quercus rubra var. coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the autumn, which gives it its common name. The tree has alternate, simple leaves that are usually oval to elliptical in shape. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that covers most of the nut, and they are an important food source for wildlife. The scarlet oak typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
