    "intro": "Quercus faginea subsp. oscensis, commonly known as the Pyrenean oak, is a subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its robust, often twisted trunk and deeply furrowed bark. The leaves are typically oblong to elliptical, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. It produces acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. This subspecies thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to rocky or mountainous terrain."
