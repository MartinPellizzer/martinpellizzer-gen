    "intro": "Quercus virgiliana f. streimii, commonly known as the Streim's Persian oak, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the Persian oak. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dense, dark green foliage. This subspecies is native to a limited geographic range in the Caucasus region, where it thrives in mountainous habitats. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and a glossy surface. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native environment."
