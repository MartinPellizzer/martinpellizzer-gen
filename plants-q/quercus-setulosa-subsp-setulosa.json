    "intro": "Quercus setulosa subsp. setulosa, commonly known as the coastal scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The plant has small, leathery, dark green leaves with fine, bristly hairs along the edges. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is an important component of the chaparral and coastal sage scrub ecosystems."
