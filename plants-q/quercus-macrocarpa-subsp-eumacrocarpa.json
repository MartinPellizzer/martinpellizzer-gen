    "intro": "Quercus macrocarpa subsp. eumacrocarpa, commonly known as the bur oak, is a large deciduous tree native to the central United States. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and distinctive, spiny acorns that are typically 1 to 2 inches in length. The tree produces a thick, flaky bark that becomes deeply furrowed with age, providing a rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along river valleys. This subspecies is notable for its longevity, with some individuals living over 200 years."
