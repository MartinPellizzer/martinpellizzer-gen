    "intro": "Quercus isodes, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that remain on the tree throughout the winter. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clustered, edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with a tendency to flake as the tree matures. Quercus isodes is well adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
