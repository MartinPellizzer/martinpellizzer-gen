    "intro": "Quercus skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a rough, textured surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus skutchii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
