It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense pubescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, mountainous environments of its native habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
