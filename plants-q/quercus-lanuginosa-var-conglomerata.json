    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. conglomerata, commonly known as the woolly oak or clustered oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the woolly oak species. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, acorn-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
