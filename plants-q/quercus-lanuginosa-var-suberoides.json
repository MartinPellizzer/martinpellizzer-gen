    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. suberoides, commonly known as the woolly oak, is a variant of the woolly oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its unique texture. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. This variant is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
