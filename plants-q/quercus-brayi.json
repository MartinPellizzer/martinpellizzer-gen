    "intro": "Quercus brayi, commonly known as the Brays oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, Quercus brayi is considered a rare and endangered species."
