    "intro": "Quercus ilex subvar. pendula, commonly known as the weeping ilex, is a variant of the evergreen oak characterized by its distinctive drooping branches. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun to partial shade. The plant features small, leathery dark green leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, followed by edible acorns that are typically harvested by wildlife. The weeping ilex is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its unique, cascading form."
