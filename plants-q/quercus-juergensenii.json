    "intro": "Quercus juergensenii, commonly known as the Florida maple-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, often with a striking red or orange coloration in the fall. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are a valuable food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 feet and has a rounded, spreading crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats."
