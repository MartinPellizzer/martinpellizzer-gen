    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii var. angulata, commonly known as the serrated rock oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. This variant of the rock oak is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring sharply serrated margins and a distinctive angular shape. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
