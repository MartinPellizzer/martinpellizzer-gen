    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. congesta, commonly known as the dense hairy oak, is a variant of the hairy oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy leaves that are typically grayish-white in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
