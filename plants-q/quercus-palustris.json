    "intro": "Quercus palustris, commonly known as the swamp oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, serrated leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it a key component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
