    "intro": "Quercus pinalensis, commonly known as the Pinal oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Quercus pinalensis is valued for its ecological role and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts in its native range."
