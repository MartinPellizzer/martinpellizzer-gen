    "intro": "Quercus aquatica var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated water oak, is a variant of the water oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The tree typically grows in wetlands and along riverbanks, adapting to moist, swampy environments. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its acorns are small and clustered in groups of two to five. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
