It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically darker green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It is native to the Balkans and parts of Anatolia, where it thrives in temperate climates. This subspecies is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
