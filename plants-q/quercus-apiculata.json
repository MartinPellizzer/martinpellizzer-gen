    "intro": "Quercus apiculata, commonly known as the mountain oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high altitudes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the following months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Quercus apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
