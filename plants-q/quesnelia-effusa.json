    "intro": "Quesnelia effusa, commonly known as the Brazilian pine or the Brazilian pineapple tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy fruits resembling pineapples. Quesnelia effusa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
