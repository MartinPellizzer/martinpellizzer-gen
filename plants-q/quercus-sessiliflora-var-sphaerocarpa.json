    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical acorns, which are enclosed in a cupule that is nearly as large as the nut itself. The leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional landscaping."
