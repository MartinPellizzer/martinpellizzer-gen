    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. patula, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a subspecies of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the typical form of Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense pubescence. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, wind-resistant thickets."
