    "intro": "Quercus infralutea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests. Quercus infralutea is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
