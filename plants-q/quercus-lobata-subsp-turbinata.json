    "intro": "Quercus lobata subsp. turbinata, commonly known as the canyon live oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces acorns that are typically encased in a cupule, a unique feature of the oak genus. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The subspecies turbinata is distinguished by its more rounded, turbinated acorns compared to other varieties of Q. lobata."
