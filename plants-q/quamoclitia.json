    "intro": "Quamoclitia, commonly known as the \"blue-eyed grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate flowers that often have a blue or violet hue. Quamoclitia species are typically found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. They produce small, grass-like leaves and are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value. The genus includes several species, each adapted to different environmental conditions across North America."
