    "intro": "Quercus palmata, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often palmately lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, round nuts enclosed in a spiny cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Quercus palmata plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
