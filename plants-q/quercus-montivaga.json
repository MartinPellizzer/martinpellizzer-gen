    "intro": "Quercus montivaga, commonly known as the mountain oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
