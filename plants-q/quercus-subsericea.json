    "intro": "Quercus subsericea, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a silvery underside. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in spring, followed by small, cup-shaped acorns. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant has a shallow root system and is relatively fast-growing compared to other oaks."
