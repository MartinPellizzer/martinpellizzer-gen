    "intro": "Quercus sphacelata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that mature over two years, providing food for various wildlife species. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age. Quercus sphacelata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
