    "intro": "Quercus humilis f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a shrub-like form of the chestnut oak native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, chestnut-brown acorns and broad, lobed leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a ornamental plant in gardens. The botanical features of this form highlight its adaptation to specific ecological niches within its native range."
