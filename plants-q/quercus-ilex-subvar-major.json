    "intro": "Quercus ilex subvar. major, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized tree with dense, leathery evergreen leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in Mediterranean climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The botanical features of this subspecies make it well adapted to dry, rocky soils and harsh environmental conditions."
