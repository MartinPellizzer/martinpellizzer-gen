    "intro": "Quercus rugulosa f. subtruncata, commonly known as the truncated scrub oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the scrub oak species. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and small, leathery leaves with a rough, textured surface. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a truncate or notched base, giving the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
