    "intro": "Quercus aerea, commonly known as the smooth oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. Quercus aerea is often found in upland forests and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
