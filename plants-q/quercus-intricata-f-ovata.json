    "intro": "Quercus intricata f. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf chinquapin, is a rare and unique variant of the chinquapin oak. It is characterized by its distinctive oval-shaped leaves, which are typically larger and more elongated compared to the typical form of Quercus intricata. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, specifically occurring in the Appalachian region. It produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a dense, leathery cap. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
