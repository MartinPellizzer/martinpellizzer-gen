    "intro": "Quercus glaucoides, commonly known as the blue oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to California. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name, and its deeply fissured, gray-barked trunk. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy coating, and the tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are edible after the husk is removed. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range. Quercus glaucoides plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
