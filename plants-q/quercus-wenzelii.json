    "intro": "Quercus wenzelii, commonly known as Wenzel's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are edible but not as widely consumed as those of other oak species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus wenzelii is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Its botanical study is important for understanding biodiversity in mountain ecosystems."
