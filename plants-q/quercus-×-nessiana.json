    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 nessiana, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (southern red oak) and Quercus falcata (chestnut oak). The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring and acorns that are edible for wildlife. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests."
