    "intro": "Qualea albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered water tree, is a species of tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is known for its striking white flowers that bloom during the dry season. The tree has a buttressed root system, which helps it stabilize in the nutrient-poor swampy soils of its habitat. Its leaves are large and palmate, and it produces woody fruits that contain fibrous seeds. Qualea albiflora plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various rainforest animals."
