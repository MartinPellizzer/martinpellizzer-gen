    "intro": "Quercus serrata var. obtusata, commonly known as the Japanese evergreen oak, is a variant of the sessile oak. It is a broadleaf evergreen tree native to Japan, characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The leaves are typically rounded at the tip, distinguishing it from the more pointed leaves of the typical Q. serrata. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that mature over a year, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
