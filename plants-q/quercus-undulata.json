    "intro": "Quercus undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy or undulating leaf margins, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions."
