    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 bossebovii, commonly known as the Bossebovii oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus sessiliflora. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks."
