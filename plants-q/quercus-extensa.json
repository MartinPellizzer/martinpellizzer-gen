    "intro": "Quercus extensa, commonly known as the broad-leafed oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus extensa typically grows to a height of 30\u201350 feet and has a broad, spreading canopy. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing a rugged texture that aids in identification."
