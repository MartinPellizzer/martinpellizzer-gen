    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited Portuguese oak, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dense, glossy foliage. This subspecies typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a rounded base and a serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
