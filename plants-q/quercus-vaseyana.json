    "intro": "Quercus vaseyana, commonly known as Vasey's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The plant has elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its leaves turn yellow in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus vaseyana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
