    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 topaliae, commonly known as the Turkey oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Turkish oak) and Quercus frainetto (Hungarian oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in the Mediterranean regions of Europe and the Middle East. The Turkey oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
