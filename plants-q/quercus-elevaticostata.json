    "intro": "Quercus elevaticostata, commonly known as the elevated-costate oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like China, Vietnam, and Myanmar. This oak is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring prominently raised veins that give it its common name. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus elevaticostata is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
