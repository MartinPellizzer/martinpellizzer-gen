    "intro": "Quercus paxtalensis, commonly known as the Patala oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of oak native to the mountainous regions of western India. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
