    "intro": "Quercus congesta var. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The leaves are lanceolate and have a distinctive, narrow shape, which distinguishes it from other oak species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The plant has a slow growth rate and is relatively long-lived, with some individuals surviving for several decades."
