    "intro": "Quercus obtusata var. typica, commonly known as the Southern Live Oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a rounded tip. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by clusters of small, inedible acorns. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, and it often grows in coastal areas with sandy soils. This species is well adapted to humid climates and is often found in hammocks and along the edges of wetlands."
