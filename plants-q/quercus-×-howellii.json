The plant typically features dense, leathery leaves with a glossy surface and a distinctive acorn shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural interest in drought-tolerant landscaping."
