It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. Its resilience makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects in coastal environments."
