    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its undulating leaf margins, which give it a unique appearance compared to typical oak species. The leaves are generally broader and have a more pronounced lobing pattern. This variant is typically found in specific microhabitats within temperate regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and limited distribution, making it a subject of study in plant taxonomy and ecology."
