    "intro": "Quercus coccifera var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf evergreen oak, is a shrub-like evergreen species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, red-orange acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
