    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical sessile oak. This form thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its acorns are generally smaller and less abundant than those of the standard species. The plant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
