    "intro": "Quercus pseudopedunculata, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible, sweet, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible yield, it is cultivated in both ornamental and agricultural settings."
