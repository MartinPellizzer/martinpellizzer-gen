    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii subf. crispatolobata, commonly known as the crinkled-leaf oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the dalechampii oak. It is characterized by its distinctive, crisped and lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in France and Italy. The tree typically grows as a small to medium-sized shrub or tree, often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
