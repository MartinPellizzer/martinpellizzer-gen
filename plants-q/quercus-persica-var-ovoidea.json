    "intro": "Quercus persica var. ovoidea, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, particularly Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, red or brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
