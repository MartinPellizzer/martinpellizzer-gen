    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 vilmoriniana, commonly known as the Vilmorin's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak). It is characterized by its robust growth and distinctive foliage, featuring broad, lobed leaves that are often darker in color than those of its parent species. The plant produces acorns that are smaller than those of the parent oaks, and it is typically found in temperate regions across Europe. Quercus \u00d7 vilmoriniana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal. Its hybrid nature makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticultural practices."
