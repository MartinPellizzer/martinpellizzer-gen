    "intro": "Quercus texana var. stellipila, commonly known as the stellipila chinquapin oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are often clustered in star-shaped patterns, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in specific regions of Texas. Its leaves are generally small and elliptical, with a leathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
