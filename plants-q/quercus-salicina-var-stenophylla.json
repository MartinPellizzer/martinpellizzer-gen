    "intro": "Quercus salicina var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock oak, is a shrub-like variant of the Chinese chestnut oak. It is native to eastern China and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, where it forms dense thickets. Its acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule, and it produces them in the fall. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
