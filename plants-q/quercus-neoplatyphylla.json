    "intro": "Quercus neoplatyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, scaly cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or steep terrain. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
