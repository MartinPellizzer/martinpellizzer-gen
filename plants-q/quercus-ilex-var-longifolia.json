    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a period of several months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand drought conditions."
