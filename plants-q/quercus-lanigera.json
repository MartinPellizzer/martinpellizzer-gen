    "intro": "Quercus lanigera, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically found in clusters. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, often developing fissures with age."
