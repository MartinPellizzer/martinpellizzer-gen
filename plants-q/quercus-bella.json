    "intro": "Quercus bella, commonly known as the beauty oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy and a trunk that is often deeply fissured. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface, turning yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that partially encloses the nut, and it produces flowers in the spring. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
