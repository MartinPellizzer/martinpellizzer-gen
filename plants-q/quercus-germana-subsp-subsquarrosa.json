    "intro": "Quercus germana subsp. subsquarrosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a rare and relict species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically retained on the tree for several years. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
