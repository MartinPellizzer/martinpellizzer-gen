    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. aurea, commonly known as the golden chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, spiny capsules that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique foliage and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
