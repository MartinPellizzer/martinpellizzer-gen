    "intro": "Quercus ithaburensis subsp. ungeri, commonly known as the Unger's oak, is a rare subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves turn a striking red or orange in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
