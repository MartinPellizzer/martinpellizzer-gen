It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and hairy foliage, which are typical features of the Quercus genus. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic variation and ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
