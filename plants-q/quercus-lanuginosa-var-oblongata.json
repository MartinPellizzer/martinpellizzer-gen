    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. oblongata, commonly known as the woolly oak or oblongate oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-brown bark and elliptical to oblong leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are edible for wildlife but generally not for humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its ornamental potential in landscaping."
