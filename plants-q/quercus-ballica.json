It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a woody cupule. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests. Quercus ballica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
