    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which are the stalks supporting its acorns. The leaves are typically oblong to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. This variant often grows in moist, well-drained soils and is found in forested areas. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
