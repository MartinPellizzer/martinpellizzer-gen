    "intro": "Quercus crispuloides, commonly known as the Mexican bristle oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of elevations in its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
