    "intro": "Quercus phellos var. viridis, commonly known as the green willow oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
