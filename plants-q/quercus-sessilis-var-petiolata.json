    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. petiolata, commonly known as the petiolate sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive petiolate (stalked) leaves, which are oval to elliptical in shape and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown acorns that mature over a season, typically requiring a cold stratification period for germination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
