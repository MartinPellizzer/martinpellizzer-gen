    "intro": "Quercus disciformis, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, which provides protection for the developing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and dry summers. The coast live oak plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
