    "intro": "Quercus radiata, commonly known as the valley oak, is a large deciduous tree native to California. It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus radiata typically grows in riparian zones and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
