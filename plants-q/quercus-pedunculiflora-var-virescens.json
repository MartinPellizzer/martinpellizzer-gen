    "intro": "Quercus pedunculiflora var. virescens, commonly known as the greenleaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that remain dense and leathery throughout the growing season. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiny acorns that mature over the summer. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced as the tree ages. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in hardwood forests."
