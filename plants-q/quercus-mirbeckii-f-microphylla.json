    "intro": "Quercus mirbeckii f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf sessile oak, is a small, deciduous tree or shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
