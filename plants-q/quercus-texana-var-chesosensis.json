    "intro": "Quercus texana var. chesosensis, commonly known as the Texas chinquapin, is a rare and endemic species native to the Edwards Plateau of Texas. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered acorns. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
