    "intro": "Quercus pilosula, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red-brown acorns that mature the following year. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus pilosula is valued for its ornamental qualities and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species."
