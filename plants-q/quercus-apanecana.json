    "intro": "Quercus apanecana, commonly known as the Apaneca oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in humid, well-drained soils. Quercus apanecana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
