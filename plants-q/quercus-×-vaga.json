    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 vaga, commonly known as the vase oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus alba (white oak) and Quercus prinus (eastern gray oak). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, vase-shaped crown and lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and often have a scaly cap, making them a food source for various wildlife species. Quercus \u00d7 vaga is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to adapt to a range of environmental conditions."
