    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 campitica subsp. hylatis, commonly known as the Hylatis oak, is a hybrid species within the Quercus genus, characterized by its unique combination of traits from its parent species. It typically exhibits a mix of features from Quercus campitica and Quercus hylatica, resulting in variable leaf shapes and acorn morphology. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, preferring partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually lobed and have a serrated margin, while its acorns are small and often covered with a dense cap. This subspecies plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
