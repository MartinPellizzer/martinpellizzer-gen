    "intro": "Quercus blakei var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved Blake oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches long and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature of the oak genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in providing habitat for local wildlife."
