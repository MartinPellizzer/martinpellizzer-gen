    "intro": "Quiina negrensis, commonly known as the Negrense quiina, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Quiina negrensis is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
