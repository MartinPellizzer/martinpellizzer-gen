    "intro": "Quercus glaucina, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are usually consumed by wildlife rather than humans. The silverleaf oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
