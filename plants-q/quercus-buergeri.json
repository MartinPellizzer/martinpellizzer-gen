    "intro": "Quercus buergeri, commonly known as the Japanese oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is typically smooth with a grayish-brown color, becoming fissured with age. Quercus buergeri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across Japan and Korea."
