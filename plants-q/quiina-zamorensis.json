    "intro": "Quiina zamorensis, commonly known as the Zamora quiina, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, a common feature among grasses. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps it to retain moisture in its native arid environment. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Quiina zamorensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
