It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its silvery-white, velvety undersides on its leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a distinctive fuzzy texture. It produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, edible acorns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
