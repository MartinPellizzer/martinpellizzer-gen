    "intro": "Quercus hemisphaerica var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Bursera, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, dense branches and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soils. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it a notable species in xerophytic plant communities."
