    "intro": "Quercus shingjenensis, commonly known as the Shingjen oak, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are typically lobed and have a serrated margin. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus shingjenensis is considered a vulnerable species."
