    "intro": "Quercus rumelica, commonly known as the Rumelic oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family Fagaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. This deciduous tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, rounded crown and dark green, lobed leaves. Its acorns are small and are enclosed in a cupule, typical of the Fagaceae family. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
