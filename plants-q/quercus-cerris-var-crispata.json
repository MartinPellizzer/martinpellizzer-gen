    "intro": "Quercus cerris var. crispata, commonly known as the Turkish oak or crinkled oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, doubly serrated leaves that have a crinkled or wavy margin, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. The bark is typically gray and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value."
