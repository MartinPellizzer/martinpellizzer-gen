    "intro": "Quercus malacophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are typically enclosed in cupules. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
