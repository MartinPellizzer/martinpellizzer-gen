    "intro": "Quercus diversicolor, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically hairless and have a smooth upper surface. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is gray and becomes deeply fissured with age, and it often grows in mixed forests. Quercus diversicolor is valued for its ecological importance and is also used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal."
