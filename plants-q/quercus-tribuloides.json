    "intro": "Quercus tribuloides, commonly known as the roughleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which are typically rough to the touch and have a broad, triangular shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a hairy cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Quercus tribuloides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
