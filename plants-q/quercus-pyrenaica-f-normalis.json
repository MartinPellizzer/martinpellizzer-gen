It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in mountainous regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ecological significance, it is often found in mixed forests and plays a key role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
