    "intro": "Quercus virginiana var. virescens, commonly known as the live oak, is a variant of the southern live oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, evergreen leaves that are typically a deep green, though the varietal form virescens may have a more vibrant or slightly different coloration. The plant is a large evergreen tree with a wide, spreading canopy and is known for its ability to thrive in coastal and wetland environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and resistance to pests and diseases. The live oak is also notable for its longevity, often living over 200 years, and its role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
