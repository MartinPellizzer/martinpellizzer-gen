    "intro": "Quercus tenuiloba f. gracilis, commonly known as the slenderleaf chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and more slender than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its foliage is often a deep green in summer and turns reddish-brown in autumn. This form is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats."
