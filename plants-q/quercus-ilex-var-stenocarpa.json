    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit evergreen oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, which is often covered in dense, woolly hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to withstand drought and coastal exposure."
