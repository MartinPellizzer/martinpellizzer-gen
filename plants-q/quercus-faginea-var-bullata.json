    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. bullata, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is partially covered by the base of the acorn itself. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests, preferring well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ecological importance and is also used in landscaping due to its ornamental features."
