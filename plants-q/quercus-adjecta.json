    "intro": "Quercus adjecta, commonly known as the red oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and acorn-producing capsules. The tree typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its leaves turn vibrant red in the fall. Quercus adjecta plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining forest ecosystems."
