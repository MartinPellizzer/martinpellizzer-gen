    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pseudinfectoria, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus polymorpha and Quercus robur. It is native to the central regions of Mexico, where it thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. It produces small, red or brown acorns that mature over a period of several months. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and landscapes due to its hardiness and adaptability."
