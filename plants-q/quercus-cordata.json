    "intro": "Quercus cordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. Its bark is thick, fissured, and gray in appearance, providing a distinctive texture. Quercus cordata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight."
