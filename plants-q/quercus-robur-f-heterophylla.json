    "intro": "Quercus robur f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf oak, is a rare form of the English oak characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It exhibits a wide variation in leaf shape, size, and margin, ranging from lobed to almost entire, which sets it apart from typical Quercus robur. This variation is often influenced by environmental factors such as light exposure and soil conditions. The plant is typically found in shaded or disturbed sites within temperate regions of Europe. Its unique foliage makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
