    "intro": "Quercus endlichiana f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf Chinese chestnut, is a compact form of the Chinese chestnut tree. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet nuts in the autumn. It is a shrub-like variant that thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible nuts in horticultural settings."
