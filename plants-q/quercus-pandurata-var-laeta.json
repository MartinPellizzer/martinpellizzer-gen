    "intro": "Quercus pandurata var. laeta, commonly known as the Laetan oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring broad, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that mature over a season, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
