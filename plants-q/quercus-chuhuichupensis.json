    "intro": "Quercus chuhuichupensis, commonly known as the Chihuichupan oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. The tree has deeply lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
