    "intro": "Quercus macrocarpa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the bur oak, is a tall, stately tree native to the central United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its distinctive, prickly acorns. The tree has a deep, extensive root system that helps it thrive in a variety of soil types, including dry and rocky conditions. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. The bur oak is valued for its durability and is often used in landscaping and as a source of timber."
