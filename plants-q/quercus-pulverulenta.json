    "intro": "Quercus pulverulenta, commonly known as the chalk hill oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky capsules that contain glossy, dark brown acorns. Its bark is typically gray to brown and becomes fissured with age. This species is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
