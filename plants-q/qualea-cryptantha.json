    "intro": "Qualea cryptantha, commonly known as the pink river dolphin plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. The plant thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, and it produces capsules as its fruit. Qualea cryptantha plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
