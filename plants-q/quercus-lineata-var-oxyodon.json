    "intro": "Quercus lineata var. oxyodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive, almost oval shape. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, typical of the oak genus. Its bark is usually gray and scaly, providing a rugged appearance. This variant is valued for its hardy nature and is often found in dry, upland habitats."
