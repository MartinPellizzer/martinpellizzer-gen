    "intro": "Quekettia pygmaea, commonly known as the pygmy grass. It is a small, mat-forming perennial grass native to the southern United States. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and wetlands. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
