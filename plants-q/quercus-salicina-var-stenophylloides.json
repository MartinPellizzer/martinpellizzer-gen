    "intro": "Quercus salicina var. stenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Chinese chestnut, is a variant of the Chinese chestnut tree native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called nuts, which are encased in a thick, scaly husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
