    "intro": "Quercus rubescens, commonly known as the red\u680e or red oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves that turn a striking red or orange color in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus rubescens typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that is typical of many oak species."
