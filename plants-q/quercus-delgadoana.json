    "intro": "Quercus delgadoana, commonly known as the Delgado's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 15 meters, often forming a broad, rounded canopy. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinct appearance. Quercus delgadoana is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
