    "intro": "Quercus breweri, commonly known as the Chihuahuan oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lobed leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and turn yellow or brown in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oak species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and canyons. The Chihuahuan oak plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
