    "intro": "Quamoclit sagittifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Urticaceae family, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its heart-shaped or arrow-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Quamoclit sagittifolia is often confused with true nettles due to its similar appearance and stinging hairs."
