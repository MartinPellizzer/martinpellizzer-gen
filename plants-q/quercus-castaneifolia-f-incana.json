    "intro": "Quercus castaneifolia f. incana, commonly known as the woolly chestnut oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-white, pubescent (hairy) bark and leaves that are broadly ovate with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two or three. Its foliage is often retained throughout the winter, giving it a distinctive appearance during the colder months. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
