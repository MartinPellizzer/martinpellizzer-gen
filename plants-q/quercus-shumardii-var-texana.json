It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and floodplains. The Texas live oak is known for its longevity and is a hardy, drought-tolerant species once established."
