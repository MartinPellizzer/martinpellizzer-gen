    "intro": "Quercus virginiana var. eximea, commonly known as the live oak, is a variant of the southern live oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a large evergreen tree characterized by its thick, sprawling canopy and deeply fissured bark. The leaves are broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and typically have a wavy or serrated margin. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in coastal and urban environments due to its tolerance of salt and pollution."
