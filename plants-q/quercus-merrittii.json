    "intro": "Quercus merrittii, commonly known as the Merritt's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Arizona and western New Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature within a single growing season. Quercus merrittii typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
