    "intro": "Quercus resinosa, commonly known as the resinous oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark, glossy leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a habitat for lichens and insects. Quercus resinosa is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and furniture."
