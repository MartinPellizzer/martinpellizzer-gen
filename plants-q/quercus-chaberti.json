    "intro": "Quercus chaberti, commonly known as the Chabert oak, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This oak is valued for its hard wood and is often found in mixed forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems in its native habitat."
