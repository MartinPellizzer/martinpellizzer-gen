    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii, commonly known as the Daubert oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow or red in the fall. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
