    "intro": "Quadrella odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet-scented quadrella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its strong, sweet aroma, which is released when the flowers are disturbed. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and arranged in a dense, compact manner. Due to its limited habitat and unique fragrance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
