    "intro": "Quercus infectoria subsp. glabra, commonly known as the African bracken fern or African oak, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by spore-bearing cones, which are typical of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species in its native habitat."
