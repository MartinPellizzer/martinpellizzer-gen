    "intro": "Quaqua ramosa, commonly known as the branched quillwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its branched stems and tiny, four-leaf clover-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge from the water. Quaqua ramosa plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
