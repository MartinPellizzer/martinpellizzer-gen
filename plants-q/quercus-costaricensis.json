    "intro": "Quercus costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican oak, is a deciduous tree native to Central America. It typically grows in moist lowland forests and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against pests. Quercus costaricensis plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat."
