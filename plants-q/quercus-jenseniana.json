    "intro": "Quercus jenseniana, commonly known as Jensen's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers areas with moderate to high elevations. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for various endemic flora and fauna. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus jenseniana is considered a vulnerable species."
