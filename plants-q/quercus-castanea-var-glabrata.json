    "intro": "Quercus castanea var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The leaves are elongated, lobed, and turn reddish-brown in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This variety is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other Quercus species."
