    "intro": "Quercus persica var. longicupulata, commonly known as the long-cupped Persian oak, is a variant of the Persian oak native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature of the Fagaceae family. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitats."
