    "intro": "Quercus oxyadenia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Its bark is gray and becomes fissured with age, providing a textured appearance. Quercus oxyadenia is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
