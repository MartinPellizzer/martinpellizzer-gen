    "intro": "Quercus pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically oval or elliptic, with a pointed tip and a smooth margin. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
