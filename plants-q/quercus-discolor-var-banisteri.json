It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a serrated margin and a rounded base. The leaves are typically gray-green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, contributing to its striking appearance. This plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
