    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 eplingii, commonly known as the Epling oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the western United States. It is the result of a natural cross between Quercus garryi and Quercus parvula, two species with distinct ecological niches. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a dense, pyramidal shape and leathery, dark green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes across its native range."
