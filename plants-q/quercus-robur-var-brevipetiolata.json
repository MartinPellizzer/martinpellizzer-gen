    "intro": "Quercus robur var. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its shorter leaf petioles. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe, particularly found in regions of the UK and parts of central Europe. The leaves are typically broad-ovate with a rounded base and a serrated margin, varying in color from dark green to reddish in autumn. Its acorns are similar to those of the common oak, being oval and enclosed in a cupule. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
