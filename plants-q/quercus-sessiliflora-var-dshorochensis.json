    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. dshorochensis, commonly known as the Dshorochensk oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairless and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
