    "intro": "Quercus ilex subvar. rotundifolia, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a rounded or slightly tapered shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to its native climate. The leaves remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature."
