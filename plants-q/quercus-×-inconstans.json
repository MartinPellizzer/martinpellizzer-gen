    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 inconstans, commonly known as the variable oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is characterized by its variable morphology, exhibiting traits that can resemble either parent species, making it challenging to classify botanically. The plant typically grows in temperate regions of Europe, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lobed, with varying degrees of serration, and its acorns are generally smaller than those of its parent species. The variability in its physical characteristics has led to its use in horticulture and ecological studies."
