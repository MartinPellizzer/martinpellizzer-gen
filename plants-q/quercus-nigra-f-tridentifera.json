    "intro": "Quercus nigra f. tridentifera, commonly known as the Trident-leaved Water Oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Water Oak. It is characterized by its uniquely trident-shaped leaves, which are deeply lobed and give it a striking appearance. This form is typically found in wetland habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is a deciduous tree, shedding its leaves in the fall, and it produces small, red-brown acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and ecological niche within riparian ecosystems."
