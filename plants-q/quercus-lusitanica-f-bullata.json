    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. bullata, commonly known as the bullate holm oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the holm oak. It is characterized by its thick, warty bark and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense pubescence. This subspecies is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts. The bullate holm oak is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
