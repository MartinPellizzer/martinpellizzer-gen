    "intro": "Quercus floccosa, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine, silky white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. The silky oak is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
