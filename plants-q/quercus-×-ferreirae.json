    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 ferreirae, commonly known as the Ferreirae oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus suber (the cork oak) and Quercus faginea (the Portuguese oak). It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and smooth, bark-like trunk, which resembles that of its parent species. The leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive shape, often with lobes that vary in size. This hybrid is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it exhibits traits that make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
