    "intro": "Quercus iltisii, commonly known as the Iltis oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, bristly cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus iltisii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
