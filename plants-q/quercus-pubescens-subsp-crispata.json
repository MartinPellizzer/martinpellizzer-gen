    "intro": "Quercus pubescens subsp. crispata, commonly known as the hairy oak or the roughleaf oak, is a subspecies of the sessile oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its pubescent, or hairy, bark and leaves that are typically lobed and have a crisp, wavy margin. The plant produces acorns that are usually small and have a cupule, or cup-like structure, that encloses the nut. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and rocky soils. The subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental features."
