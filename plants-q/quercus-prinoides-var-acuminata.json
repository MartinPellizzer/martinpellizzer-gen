It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorn-producing capability. The leaves are typically narrow and elliptical, with a pointed tip, and they turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
