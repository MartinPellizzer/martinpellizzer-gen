    "intro": "Quercus trinitatis, commonly known as the Trinidad oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woody cupule. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
