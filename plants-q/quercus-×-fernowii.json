    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fernowii, commonly known as the Fernow oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus muehlenbergii and Quercus bicolor. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a rounded crown and dark green, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its acorns are small, oval, and have a scaly cap, maturing in the second year. The species is valued for its adaptability and is often used in landscape planting due to its ornamental appeal."
