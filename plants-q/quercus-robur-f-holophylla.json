    "intro": "Quercus robur f. holophylla, commonly known as the white oak with full foliage, is a rare and distinctive form of the common white oak. It is characterized by its dense, lush canopy of leaves that remain fully developed throughout the growing season. The leaves are typically larger and more rounded compared to the standard form, with a glossy, dark green appearance. This form is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Botanically, it exhibits unique leaf morphology that sets it apart from other Quercus species."
