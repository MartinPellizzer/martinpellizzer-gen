    "intro": "Quercus brantii subsp. oophora, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces acorns, which are enclosed in a cupule and serve as a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and habitat provision for endemic flora and fauna."
