    "intro": "Quercus petraea var. polycarpa, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a variant of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces acorns that are smaller and more numerous compared to other oak species, contributing to its ecological significance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and forest edges. This variant is valued for its hardy nature and role in supporting biodiversity."
