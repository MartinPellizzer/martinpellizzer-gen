    "intro": "Quercus laurifolia var. typica, commonly known as the laurel oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that remain dense and compact throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of small, chestnut-like fruits. Its root system is extensive and often forms a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats."
