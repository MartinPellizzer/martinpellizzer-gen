    "intro": "Quercus fenzlii, commonly known as the Fenzli oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
