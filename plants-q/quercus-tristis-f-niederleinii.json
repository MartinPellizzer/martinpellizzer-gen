    "intro": "Quercus tristis f. niederleinii, commonly known as the Niederleinii oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the European pedunculate oak. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and narrow, elongated leaves with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions of Central Europe. Its botanical features include a slender trunk and a rounded crown, which contribute to its unique appearance. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
