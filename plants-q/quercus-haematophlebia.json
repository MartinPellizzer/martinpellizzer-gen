    "intro": "Quercus haematophlebia, commonly known as the red-veined oak, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, with leaves that have deep red veins contrasting against a dark green background. The plant is a deciduous tree, shedding its leaves in the autumn season. Its acorns are small and typically have a cupule that encloses most of the nut. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, Quercus haematophlebia is considered a botanical curiosity and of scientific interest."
