    "intro": "Quercus alamosensis, commonly known as the Alamos oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The Alamos oak is often found in chaparral and woodlands, contributing to local biodiversity."
