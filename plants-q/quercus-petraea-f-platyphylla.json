    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf pedunculate oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the pedunculate oak. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that differ from the typical lobed shape of the parent species. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as shaded, moist forest floors, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for ecological studies."
