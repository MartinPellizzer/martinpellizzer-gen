    "intro": "Quercus tarahumara, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of its native ecosystem."
