    "intro": "Quercus arbutifolia, commonly known as the swamp chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, dark red acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus arbutifolia typically grows in wet, acidic soils along stream banks and in swamps, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
