    "intro": "Quercus aliena var. alticupuliformis, commonly known as the high-cupped oak, is a rare variant of the alien oak species. It is characterized by its unique cupule structure, which is more elongated and elevated compared to typical oak cupules. The leaves are generally broader and have a coarser texture, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variant is typically found in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
