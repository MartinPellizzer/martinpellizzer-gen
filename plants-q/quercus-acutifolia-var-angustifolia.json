    "intro": "Quercus acutifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf rock\u680e, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by hard, acorn-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage and form make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
