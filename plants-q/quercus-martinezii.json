    "intro": "Quercus martinezii, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and chaparral habitats. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors."
