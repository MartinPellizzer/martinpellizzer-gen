    "intro": "Quercus subturbinella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a species of oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant produces small, pale green acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is loosely attached to the acorn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. This species is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
