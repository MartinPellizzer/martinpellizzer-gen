    "intro": "Quercus robur f. brachybalanus, commonly known as the short-leaved oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the common oak. It is characterized by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to typical Quercus robur. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with reduced leaf lobes and a more rounded foliage structure. It is primarily found in specific microhabitats within Europe, often in moist, shaded environments. This form is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological variations."
