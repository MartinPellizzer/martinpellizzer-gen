    "intro": "Quercus marilandica f. subquinqueloba, commonly known as the Maryland oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white oak. It is characterized by its unique lobed leaves, which are more deeply cut than those of typical white oaks, giving it a more intricate appearance. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. Its acorns are small and usually require a period of cold stratification to germinate. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological distinctiveness."
