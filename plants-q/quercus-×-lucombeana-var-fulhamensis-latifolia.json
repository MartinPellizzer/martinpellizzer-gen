    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 lucombeana var. fulhamensis-latifolia, commonly known as the Fulham White Oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus sessiliflora. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically pale green and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common in many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its ornamental value lies in its distinctive foliage and historical significance in botanical studies."
