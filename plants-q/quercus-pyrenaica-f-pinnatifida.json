    "intro": "Quercus pyrenaica f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Iberian sessile oak, is a variant of the Pyrenean oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its pinnatifid leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble those of the common oak but with a more pronounced, narrow shape. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its acorns are small and have a short stalk, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and adaptation to its specific habitat."
