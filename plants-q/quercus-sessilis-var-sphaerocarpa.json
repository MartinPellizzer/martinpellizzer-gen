    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-leaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, red to brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. Its bark is gray and becomes fissured with age, providing a rugged texture. This variant is closely related to other species in the Quercus genus and shares many botanical traits with its relatives."
