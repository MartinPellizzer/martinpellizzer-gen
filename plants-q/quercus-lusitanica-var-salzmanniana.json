    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. salzmanniana, commonly known as the Salzmann's oak, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, leathery leaves that are often pubescent. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in Mediterranean climates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
