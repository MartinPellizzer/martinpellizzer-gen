    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. asperata, commonly known as the rough-hairy oak, is a variant of the silky oak native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, acorn-like fruits. The leaves are typically dark green and have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
