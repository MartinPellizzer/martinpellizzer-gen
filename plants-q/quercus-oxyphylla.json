    "intro": "Quercus oxyphylla, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by cup-shaped acorns. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Quercus oxyphylla is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its hard, durable wood."
