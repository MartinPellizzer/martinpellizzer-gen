    "intro": "Qualea trichanthera, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Qualea trichanthera plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitats."
