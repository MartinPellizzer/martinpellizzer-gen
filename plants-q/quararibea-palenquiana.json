    "intro": "Quararibea palenquiana, commonly known as the Palenquilla tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The tree produces a milky sap that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. It thrives in humid, lowland environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
