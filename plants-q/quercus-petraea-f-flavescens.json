    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. flavescens, commonly known as the golden rock oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common sessile oak. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which sets it apart from the typical dark green leaves of the parent species. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in calcareous soils where it thrives in rocky or exposed conditions. The leaves are usually smaller and more elongated compared to the standard variety, and the acorns are similar in structure but may exhibit slight variations in size and color. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in specialized horticulture and ecological studies."
