    "intro": "Quercus chiapasensis f. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chestnut oak, is a rare variant of the chiapasensis oak species native to the highlands of Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its acorns are small and edible, though the tree is more valued for its ecological role than for its timber. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
