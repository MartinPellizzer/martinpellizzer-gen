    "intro": "Quercus yayamensis, commonly known as the Yayam\u00e9n oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oblong to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, followed by acorns that are edible and serve as a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
