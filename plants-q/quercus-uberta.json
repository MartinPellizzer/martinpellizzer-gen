    "intro": "Quercus uberta, commonly known as the Uberta oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico, where it thrives in temperate climates. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. Its acorns are typically small and are an important food source for local wildlife. The Uberta oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
