    "intro": "Quercus kovatsiana, commonly known as the Kovatsian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
