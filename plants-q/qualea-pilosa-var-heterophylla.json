    "intro": "Qualea pilosa var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable waterleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in marshy or seasonally flooded habitats, demonstrating adaptability to fluctuating water levels. Its botanical variability makes it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
