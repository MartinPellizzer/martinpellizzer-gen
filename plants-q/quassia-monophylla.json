    "intro": "Quassia monophylla, commonly known as the African quassia, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. Its roots and bark contain quassinoids, which are potent natural compounds used in traditional medicine. Quassia monophylla is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
