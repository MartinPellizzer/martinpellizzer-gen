    "intro": "Quercus moulei, commonly known as the Moule oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern France. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution, Quercus moulei is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
