    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 asheana, commonly known as the Ashe oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and the southern red oak (Quercus falcata). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The Ashe oak has lobed leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter in color underneath, with a serrated margin. Its acorns are small and typically require a period of cold stratification to germinate. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to support local wildlife."
