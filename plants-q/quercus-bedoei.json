    "intro": "Quercus bedoei, commonly known as the Bedoe oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of Namibia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and minimal leaf surface to reduce water loss. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat degradation, Quercus bedoei is considered a vulnerable species."
