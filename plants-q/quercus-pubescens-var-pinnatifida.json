It is characterized by its elongated, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional Chinese medicine."
