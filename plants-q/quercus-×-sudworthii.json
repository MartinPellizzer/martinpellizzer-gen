    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 sudworthii, commonly known as the Sudworth oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus bicolor and Quercus macrocarpa. It is a deciduous tree native to the central United States, particularly in Illinois and Iowa. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, spreading crown and lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The Sudworth oak is valued for its adaptability and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental appeal and tolerance to various soil conditions."
