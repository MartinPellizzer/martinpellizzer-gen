    "intro": "Quercus chinantlensis, commonly known as the Chinantla oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its deep green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
