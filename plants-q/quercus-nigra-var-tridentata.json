    "intro": "Quercus nigra var. tridentata, commonly known as the southern red oak variant, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its deep reddish-brown bark and acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The leaves are usually broad-ovate with three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. This variant is closely related to the common red oak (Quercus rubra) but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
