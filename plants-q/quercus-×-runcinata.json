    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 runcinata, commonly known as the coastal live oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sand live oak (Quercus geminata) and the evergreen oak (Quercus virginiana). It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive rounded tip. This plant is typically found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The tree is evergreen, with a slow growth rate and a broad, spreading canopy. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
