    "intro": "Quercus frainetto var. typica, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. The Hungarian oak is valued for its hard wood and is often used in forestry and land reclamation projects."
