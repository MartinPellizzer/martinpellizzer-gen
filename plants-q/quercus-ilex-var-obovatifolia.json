    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. obovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holm oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen, lanceolate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the following months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties."
