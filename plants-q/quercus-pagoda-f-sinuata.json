    "intro": "Quercus pagoda f. sinuata, commonly known as the Chinese pagoda oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive pagoda-like crown and serrated, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is well adapted to cooler, moist climates."
