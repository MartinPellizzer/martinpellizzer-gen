    "intro": "Quercus dalbertisii, commonly known as the Dalbert's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that mature over the course of several months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in high-altitude forests. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
