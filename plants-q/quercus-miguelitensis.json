    "intro": "Quercus miguelitensis, commonly known as Miguel's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorns. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus miguelitensis is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
