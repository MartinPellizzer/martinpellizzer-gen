    "intro": "Quinchamalium majus, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble bells, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has a thick, woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental species in warm climates. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its natural spread in the wild."
