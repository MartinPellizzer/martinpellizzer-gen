    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 celtica, commonly known as the Celtic oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces acorns that are smaller than those of its parent species and are often covered with a dense, hairy coating. Quercus \u00d7 celtica is native to western Europe and is often found in mixed forests, preferring well-drained soils and moderate climates. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in European woodlands."
