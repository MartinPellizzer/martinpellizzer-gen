    "intro": "Qualea cordata var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's leaves float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the muddy substrate. It produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This species plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native wetland environments."
