    "intro": "Quercus insignis, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in dry to moist forests and is often found in mountainous regions. Quercus insignis has a slow growth rate and can live for over 100 years, making it a long-lived species in its native habitat."
