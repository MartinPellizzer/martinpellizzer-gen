    "intro": "Quercus annulata, commonly known as the ringed oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive ringed bark, which develops as the tree matures. The leaves are typically lobed and alternate, turning vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
