    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. gymnobalanus, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery evergreen leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is commonly used in landscaping and as a windbreak."
