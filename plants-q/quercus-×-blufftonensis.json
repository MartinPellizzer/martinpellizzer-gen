    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 blufftonensis, commonly known as the Bluffton oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus bicolor and Quercus phellos. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its unique combination of features from both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and a moderate growth rate. The leaves are typically lobed, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. This species is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in coastal areas of South Carolina and Georgia. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
