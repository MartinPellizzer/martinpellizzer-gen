    "intro": "Quercus oxyodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its lobed leaves that are narrower than those of typical oaks. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. Quercus oxyodon typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions."
