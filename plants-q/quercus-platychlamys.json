    "intro": "Quercus platychlamys, commonly known as the broad-leaved white oak, is a species of oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically pale to medium green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a shallow cupule. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing a rugged appearance. This species is valued for its durable wood and plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
