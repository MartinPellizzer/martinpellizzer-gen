    "intro": "Quercus californica, commonly known as the California live oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a range of climates, including coastal and inland areas. Its dense canopy and slow growth rate make it a long-lived and resilient species in its native habitat."
