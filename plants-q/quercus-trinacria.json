    "intro": "Quercus trinacria, commonly known as the Sicilian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily and southern Italy. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its distinctive acorns, which are enclosed in a cupule. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a broad, rounded canopy. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Quercus trinacria plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to local biodiversity."
