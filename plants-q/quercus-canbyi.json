    "intro": "Quercus canbyi, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its white to grayish bark and lobed, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The Arizona white oak plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
