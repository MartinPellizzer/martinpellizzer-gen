    "intro": "Quercus prinus var. bicolor, commonly known as the twinleaf oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are divided into two pairs of lobes, giving it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense layer of fuzzy hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
