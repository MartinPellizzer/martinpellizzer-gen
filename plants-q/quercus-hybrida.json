    "intro": "Quercus hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus rubra (red oak) and Quercus phellos (willow oak), exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and dark green, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its acorns are small and often covered with a dense, scaly cap, and the bark is gray and furrowed with a rough texture. Quercus hybrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
