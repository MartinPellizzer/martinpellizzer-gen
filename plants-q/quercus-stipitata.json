    "intro": "Quercus stipitata, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, rounded form and leathery, dark green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to fire-prone environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
