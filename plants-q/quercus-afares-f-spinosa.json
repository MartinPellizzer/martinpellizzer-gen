    "intro": "Quercus afares f. spinosa, commonly known as the bristly oak, is a shrub-like form of the species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage, which provides protection against herbivores. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. Its small, acorn-like fruits are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. This variety thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
