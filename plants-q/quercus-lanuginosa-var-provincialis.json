    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. provincialis, commonly known as the Provincial buckthorn oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, round acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed sites. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
