    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a botanical variant of the sessile oak characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features elongated, narrow leaves with a serrated margin, which distinguish it from the typical sessile oak. This form is typically found in rocky or mountainous habitats where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
