    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 comari, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or Catalan chestnut, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus faginea and Quercus coccifera. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and horticultural settings."
