It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riparian habitats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical, and have a serrated margin. The Moulton oak produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
