    "intro": "Qualea selloi subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the white water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, white petals and heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
