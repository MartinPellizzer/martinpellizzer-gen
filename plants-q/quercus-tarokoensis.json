    "intro": "Quercus tarokoensis, commonly known as the Taroko oak, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. It produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
