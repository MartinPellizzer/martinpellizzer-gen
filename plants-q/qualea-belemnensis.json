    "intro": "Qualea belemnensis, commonly known as the white river mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the Amazon Basin. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in coastal swamps and estuaries. The plant has a unique ability to tolerate high salinity levels, which is crucial for its survival in tidal areas. Its leaves are typically small and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial species."
