    "intro": "Quercus santaclarensis, commonly known as the Santa Clara oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to southern California. It is characterized by its dense foliage and broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by acorns that are important for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native region."
