    "intro": "Quercus ilex subvar. brevicalyx, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Q. ilex. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with mild winters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
