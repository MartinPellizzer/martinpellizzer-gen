    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved holm oak, is a shrub-like form of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens."
