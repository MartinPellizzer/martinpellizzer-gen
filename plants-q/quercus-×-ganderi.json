It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically smaller and more elongated compared to those of its parent species. The leaves of Quercus \u00d7 ganderi are usually lobed and have a serrated margin, varying in shape depending on the parentage. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid, showcasing the genetic diversity within the genus Quercus."
