    "intro": "Quercus virginiana var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf live oak, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small spaces and rock gardens."
