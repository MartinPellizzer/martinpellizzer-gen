    "intro": "Quiina yatuensis, commonly known as the East African rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and small, edible fruits. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps it conserve water in its natural habitat. The fruit, which is a small, green fig-like berry, is an important food source for various wildlife species."
