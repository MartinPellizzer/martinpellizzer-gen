    "intro": "Quercus sideroxyla f. ciliifera, commonly known as the ciliate oak, is a variant of the ironwood oak native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dark green, glossy leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. The species is valued for its hard, dense wood and is also of interest for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
