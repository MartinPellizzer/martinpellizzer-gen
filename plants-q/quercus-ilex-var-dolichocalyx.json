    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. dolichocalyx, commonly known as the longleaf evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery evergreen leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a hairy cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
