    "intro": "Quercus obliquinervia, commonly known as the Chinese rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to China, particularly in the regions of Sichuan and Yunnan. It is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and dense, shrub-like growth habit, often thriving in rocky or mountainous terrain. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive, irregularly serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, woolly layer of hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
