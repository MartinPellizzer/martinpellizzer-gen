It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a distinctive elliptical shape with a rounded tip. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
