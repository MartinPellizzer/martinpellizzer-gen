    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 sterrettii, commonly known as the Sterrett oak, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Quercus ellipsoidalis and Quercus garryi. It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and paler underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks."
