It is characterized by its striking silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its unique foliage."
