    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the English oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is a deciduous tree native to Europe, characterized by its robust growth and distinctive lobed leaves. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Botanically, it exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in ecological and genetic studies."
