    "intro": "Quercus ilex subf. major, commonly known as the holm oak, is a subspecies of the evergreen oak native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, alkaline soils.
