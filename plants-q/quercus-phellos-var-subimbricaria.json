    "intro": "Quercus phellos var. subimbricaria, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a variant of the willow oak native to the southwestern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its elongated, willow-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. This variant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in regions with limited water availability."
