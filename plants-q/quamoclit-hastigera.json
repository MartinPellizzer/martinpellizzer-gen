    "intro": "Quamoclit hastigera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
