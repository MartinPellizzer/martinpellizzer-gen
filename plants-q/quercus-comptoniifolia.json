    "intro": "Quercus comptoniifolia, commonly known as the Compton's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a wavy margin. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. The botanical features of Quercus comptoniifolia make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
