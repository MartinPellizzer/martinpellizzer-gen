    "intro": "Quercus sibthorpii, commonly known as the Sibthorp's oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dense, leathery leaves. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
