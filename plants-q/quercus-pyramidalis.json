    "intro": "Quercus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramid-shaped crown and smooth, gray bark that develops fissures with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and oblong with a pointed tip, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, pale green acorns that are encased in a cupule, typically maturing in the second year. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
