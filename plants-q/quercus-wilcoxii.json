    "intro": "Quercus wilcoxii, commonly known as the Wilcox oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within mesic to wet forests. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive shape and is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits. It plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Quercus wilcoxii is classified as endangered."
