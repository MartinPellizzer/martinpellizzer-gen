    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. fruticosa, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a shrub-like variant of the coast live oak, characterized by its dense, multi-stemmed growth habit. It is native to coastal regions of California and Baja California, where it thrives in mild, wet winters and dry summers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. The botanical features of this variety make it a resilient and ecologically significant plant in its native environment."
