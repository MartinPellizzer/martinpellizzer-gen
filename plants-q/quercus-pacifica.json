    "intro": "Quercus pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific coast oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree has a broad, spreading crown and produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a serrated edge and turn yellow in the fall. Quercus pacifica is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
