    "intro": "Quercus nicotrae, commonly known as the Nicotra's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth upper surface. The plant produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
