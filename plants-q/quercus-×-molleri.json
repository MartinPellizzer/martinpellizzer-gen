    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 molleri, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rugosa and Quercus berlandieri. It is native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, elliptical leaves that remain green throughout the year. Its small, urn-shaped acorns are typically enclosed in cupules with bristly hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in arid landscapes due to its drought tolerance."
