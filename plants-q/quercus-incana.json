    "intro": "Quercus incana, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving them a silky texture. The leaves turn yellow in the fall before dropping, contributing to the tree's seasonal beauty. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to a range of soil conditions."
