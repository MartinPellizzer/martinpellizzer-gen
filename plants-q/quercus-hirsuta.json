    "intro": "Quercus hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its gray-brown bark and oval, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The tree produces small, pale yellow to reddish flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are typically enclosed in cupules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests. Quercus hirsuta is valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
