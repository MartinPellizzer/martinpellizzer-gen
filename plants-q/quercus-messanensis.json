    "intro": "Quercus messanensis, commonly known as the Messina oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sicily. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with a rounded canopy and dark green, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced with age. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
