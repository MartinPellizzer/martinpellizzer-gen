    "intro": "Quercus variabilis, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often serrated leaves that change color with the seasons. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by spiny, cup-shaped fruits containing one or two edible nuts. Its bark is thick, fissured, and dark gray, providing structural support and protection. Quercus variabilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional Chinese medicine."
