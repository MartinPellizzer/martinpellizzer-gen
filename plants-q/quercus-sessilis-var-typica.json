    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. typica, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and acorns that lack a cap, which is a distinguishing feature from other oak species. The leaves are typically elliptical with a rounded tip and serrated edges, and they turn yellow in the fall. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
