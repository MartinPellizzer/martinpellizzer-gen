    "intro": "Quercus spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny oak or bristly oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its distinctive, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland dunes. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a rough, textured surface and a pointed tip. Quercus spinulosa is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
