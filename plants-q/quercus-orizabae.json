    "intro": "Quercus orizabae, commonly known as the Orizaba oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the central mountain regions, where it thrives in high-altitude forests. This evergreen oak is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of its native ecosystem."
