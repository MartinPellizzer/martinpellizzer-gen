It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus slavica typically grows in forested areas and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
