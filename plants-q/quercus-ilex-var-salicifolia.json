    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. salicifolia, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or the Aleppo chestnut, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
