    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. condensata, commonly known as the denseleaf chinquapin, is a rare and ancient oak species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically 5\u20139 cm long and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that mature over two years, and its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mixed coniferous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
