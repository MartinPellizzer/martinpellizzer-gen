    "intro": "Quercus robur subvar. pseudosessilis, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a variant of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its small, closely spaced leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its acorns are small and have a short stalk, distinguishing it from other oak species. This subvariety is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping and forestry."
