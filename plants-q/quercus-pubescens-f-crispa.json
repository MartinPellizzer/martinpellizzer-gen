    "intro": "Quercus pubescens f. crispa, commonly known as the hairy oak with crisped leaves, is a distinctive variant of the downy oak. It is characterized by its serrated, wavy-edged leaves that exhibit a unique crinkled texture. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its small, acorn-like fruits are typically produced in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in supporting wildlife. The botanical interest of this form lies in its morphological variation and adaptation to specific environmental conditions."
