    "intro": "Quercus brachyphylla subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native environment."
