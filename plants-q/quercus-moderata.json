    "intro": "Quercus moderata, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in a rounded shape with a dense canopy and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Quercus moderata is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and dry summers, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
