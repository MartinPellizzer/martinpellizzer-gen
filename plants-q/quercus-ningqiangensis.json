    "intro": "Quercus ningqiangensis, commonly known as the Ningqiang oak, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorns. The plant is typically found in mountainous regions with a humid climate, growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorn cups that support the development of its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
