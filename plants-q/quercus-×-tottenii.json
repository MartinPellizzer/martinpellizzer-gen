    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 tottenii, commonly known as the Totten oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus macrocarpa (bur oak) and Quercus bicolor (swamp white oak). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces acorns that are smaller than those of its parent species and have a distinctive cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This hybrid is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
