    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. pallida, commonly known as the whiteleaf chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow undersides on its leaves, which distinguish it from other oak species. The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its acorns are edible and are often consumed by wildlife, contributing to its ecological importance. The leaves are elliptical with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, adding to its ornamental value."
