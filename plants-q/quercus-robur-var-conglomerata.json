    "intro": "Quercus robur var. conglomerata, commonly known as the English oak variant conglomerata, is a rare and distinctive form of the common oak. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and unique foliage, with leaves that are often smaller and more clustered than those of the typical Quercus robur. The plant exhibits a high degree of genetic variation, which contributes to its unusual appearance. It is primarily found in specific regions of Europe, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
