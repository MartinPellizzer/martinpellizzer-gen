    "intro": "Quercus infectoria var. petiolaris, commonly known as the African bracken fern or African oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, acorn-like fruits that are dispersed by animals. Its bark contains tannins and has been historically used in the tanning industry. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
