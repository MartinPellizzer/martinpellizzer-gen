    "intro": "Quercus trichodonta, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiky husk. Quercus trichodonta is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its historical significance in traditional medicine. However, it is now considered endangered due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
