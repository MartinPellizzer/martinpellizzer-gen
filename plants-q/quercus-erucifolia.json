    "intro": "Quercus erucifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in Mediterranean climates."
