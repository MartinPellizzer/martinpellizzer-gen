It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically lobed and have a rough, hairy texture. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. This variant is distinguished from other Quercus species by its specific leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
