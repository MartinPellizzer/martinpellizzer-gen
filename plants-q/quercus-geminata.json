    "intro": "Quercus geminata, commonly known as the Florida ash or silverleaf oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often twice-lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers in the spring, followed by small, leathery acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Quercus geminata is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
