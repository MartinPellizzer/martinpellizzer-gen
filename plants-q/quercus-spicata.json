    "intro": "Quercus spicata, commonly known as the bristlecone oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for centuries, making it one of the longest-living tree species. Its leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a leathery texture that helps it conserve water in arid environments. Quercus spicata plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
