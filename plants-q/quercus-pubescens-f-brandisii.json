    "intro": "Quercus pubescens f. brandisii, commonly known as the Brandis oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the downy oak. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage and acorns that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. This form is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves are often narrower and more elongated compared to the standard Quercus pubescens. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife species."
