    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 schochiana, commonly known as the Sch\u00f6ch's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and forest biodiversity."
