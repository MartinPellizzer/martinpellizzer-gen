    "intro": "Quercus kunstleri, commonly known as the Kunstleri oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Spain. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus kunstleri is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
