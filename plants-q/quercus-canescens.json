    "intro": "Quercus canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy cap. The tree has a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid landscapes. Quercus canescens plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
