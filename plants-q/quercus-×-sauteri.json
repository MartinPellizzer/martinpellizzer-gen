    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 sauteri, commonly known as the Sauter's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus sessilifolia (chestnut oak). It is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are typically lobed and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks."
