    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. almissana, commonly known as the Algerian evergreen oak, is a shrub-like variant of the holm oak. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the typical Quercus ilex. This form is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing a high degree of drought tolerance. Its small, acorn-like fruits are often retained on the plant for extended periods. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing coastal and Mediterranean landscapes."
