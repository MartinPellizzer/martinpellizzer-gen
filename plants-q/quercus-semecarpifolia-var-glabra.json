    "intro": "Quercus semecarpifolia var. glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf Oregon white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and elongated, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. The leaves are dark green, leathery, and have a distinctive shape with a rounded base and a pointed tip. This variety is closely related to other white oaks and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
