    "intro": "Quercus scytophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive in appearance. Its bark is gray and fissured, providing a rugged texture. Quercus scytophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomland hardwood forests."
