    "intro": "Quercus versatilis, commonly known as the variable oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which can range from elliptical to ovate, depending on environmental conditions. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a fuzzy cap. Its bark is generally smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, adding to its distinctive appearance. Quercus versatilis is valued for its adaptability and is often found in a variety of habitats, including forests and woodland edges."
