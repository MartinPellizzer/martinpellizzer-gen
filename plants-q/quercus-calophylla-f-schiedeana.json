    "intro": "Quercus calophylla f. schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiede's evergreen oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the evergreen oak species. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, with leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in humid, high-altitude environments. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
