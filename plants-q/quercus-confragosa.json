    "intro": "Quercus confragosa, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dry to moist forests. Quercus confragosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
