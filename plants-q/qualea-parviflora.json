    "intro": "Qualea parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in early morning. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving rivers and lakes. Qualea parviflora plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
