    "intro": "Quercus aquatica, commonly known as the water oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of small, inedible acorns. Its roots are adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it a common species in wetland environments. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps it withstand harsh conditions."
