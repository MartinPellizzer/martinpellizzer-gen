    "intro": "Quercus debaryana, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The Turkish oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also an important component of local ecosystems."
