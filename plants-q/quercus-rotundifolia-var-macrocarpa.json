    "intro": "Quercus rotundifolia var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-leaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often lobed and have a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, pale green flowers in early spring, followed by edible acorns that mature in the fall. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is well adapted to moist, fertile soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
