    "intro": "Quercus cerris subf. subpinnatolobata, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the common oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a subpinnate-lobate structure with deeply divided lobes. The leaves are typically broad and have a silvery-white underside, which distinguishes it from other oak species. This subspecies is native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of Anatolia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
