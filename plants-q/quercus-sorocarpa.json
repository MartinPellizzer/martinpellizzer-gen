    "intro": "Quercus sorocarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature that distinguishes it from other oak species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The botanical features of Quercus sorocarpa make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
