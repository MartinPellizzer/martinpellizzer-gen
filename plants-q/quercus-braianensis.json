    "intro": "Quercus braianensis, commonly known as the Brazilian oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a deep green color. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus braianensis is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several conservation areas."
