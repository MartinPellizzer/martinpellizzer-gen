    "intro": "Quercus hemisphaerica var. maritima, commonly known as the maritime live oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating to resist salt spray. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its extensive root system helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in salty, well-drained soils and withstand harsh coastal conditions."
