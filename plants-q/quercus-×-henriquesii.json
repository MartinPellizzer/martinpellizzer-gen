    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) and Quercus faginea (Hungarian oak). It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits, combining features of both parent species. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring well-drained soils and moderate climates. Its leaves are usually lobed, with a serrated margin, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. This hybrid is relatively rare and is often found in specific habitats where its parent species overlap."
