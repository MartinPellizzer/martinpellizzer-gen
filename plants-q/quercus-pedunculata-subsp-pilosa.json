    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy pedunculate oak, is a deciduous tree native to parts of East Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and elongated, pendulous branches. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The acorns are small, typically less than 1 cm in length, and are borne in clusters on short peduncles. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive hairy foliage and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
