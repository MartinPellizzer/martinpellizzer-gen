    "intro": "Quercus loeseneri, commonly known as the Loesener's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
