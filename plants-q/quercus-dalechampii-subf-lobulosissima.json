    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii subf. lobulosissima, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
