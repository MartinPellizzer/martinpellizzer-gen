    "intro": "Quercus gemmata, commonly known as the gemma oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its short, broad leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for wildlife, particularly birds and squirrels. Quercus gemmata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its compact growth habit and unique foliage make it a notable species in its native ecosystem."
