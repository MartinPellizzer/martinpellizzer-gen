    "intro": "Quercus petiolata, commonly known as the sand live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that remain on the tree year-round, providing dense shade. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Its root system is extensive and drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to sandy soils. The tree is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
