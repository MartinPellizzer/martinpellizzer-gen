    "intro": "Quercus arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, inedible acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Quercus arizonica plays an important role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
