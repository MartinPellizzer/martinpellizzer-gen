    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery, evergreen leaves that are rounded or oval in shape. The tree produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the course of a year. It is typically found in rocky or dry soils and is well adapted to coastal and arid environments. The species is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping and as a windbreak in Mediterranean climates."
