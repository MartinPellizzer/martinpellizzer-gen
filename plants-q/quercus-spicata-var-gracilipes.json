    "intro": "Quercus spicata var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slenderleaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow to brown in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
