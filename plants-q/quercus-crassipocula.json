    "intro": "Quercus crassipocula, commonly known as the broad-leaved oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus crassipocula is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
