    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 szovitzii, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly found in Hungary, Romania, and parts of the Balkans. This tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has dark gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are lobed, often with 5\u20137 lobes, and turn yellow or red in the fall. The plant produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
