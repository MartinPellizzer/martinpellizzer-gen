    "intro": "Quadrella torulosa, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a member of the family Pterobryaceae. It is a small, cushion-like moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit with bright yellow-green leaves that are often curled or twisted. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and are typically reddish in color. Quadrella torulosa is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in soil stabilization."
