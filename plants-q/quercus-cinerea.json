    "intro": "Quercus cinerea, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas. This species is well adapted to drought and salt spray, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
