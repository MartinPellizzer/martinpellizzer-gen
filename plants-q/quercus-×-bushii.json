    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 bushii, commonly known as the Bushy oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus sessiliflora. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that mature over a period of several months. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas with well-drained soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its genetic background."
