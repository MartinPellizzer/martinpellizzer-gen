    "intro": "Quercus jonesii, commonly known as Jones' oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
