    "intro": "Quercus alpestris var. salicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mountain oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or red in the autumn. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates."
