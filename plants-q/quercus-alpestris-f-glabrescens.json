    "intro": "Quercus alpestris f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and a smooth margin. This form is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical sessile oak, giving it a more refined appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at higher elevations."
