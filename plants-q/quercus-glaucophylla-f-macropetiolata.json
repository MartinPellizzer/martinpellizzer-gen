    "intro": "Quercus glaucophylla f. macropetiolata, commonly known as the large-leafed blue oak, is a variant of the blue oak native to California. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glaucous beneath, giving it a distinctive bluish-gray appearance. The leaves are typically longer and broader than those of the typical species, with prominent veins and a serrated margin. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. This form is adapted to the dry, inland environments of the California foothills and valleys."
