    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 badensis, commonly known as the Baden oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak). It is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe, particularly found in regions of Germany and the Czech Republic. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves. It produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The botanical features of Quercus \u00d7 badensis make it a valuable subject for studying hybridization in oak species."
