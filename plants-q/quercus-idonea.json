    "intro": "Quercus idonea, commonly known as the red oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, sprawling growth habit and deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, pale green acorns that are encased in a cupule, which provides protection for the developing seeds. Its bark is thick and furrowed, offering a rugged appearance that aids in identification. Quercus idonea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
