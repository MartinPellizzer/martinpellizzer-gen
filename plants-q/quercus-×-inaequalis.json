It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically 1 to 2 centimeters in length. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Botanically, it exhibits features intermediate between its parent species, making it a subject of interest in plant hybridization studies."
