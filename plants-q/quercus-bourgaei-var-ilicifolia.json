    "intro": "Quercus bourgaei var. ilicifolia, commonly known as the glossy-leaf chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China. It is characterized by its leathery, glossy dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits that contain single seeds. It thrives in cool, moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
