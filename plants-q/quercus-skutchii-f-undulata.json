    "intro": "Quercus skutchii f. undulata, commonly known as the undulating scrub oak, is a rare and unique variant of the scrub oak species native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. This plant is characterized by its distinctive undulating leaf margins, which give it its common name and set it apart from other members of the Quercus genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained, acidic soils, typically found in mountainous regions. The leaves are small, leathery, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ecological and horticultural significance."
