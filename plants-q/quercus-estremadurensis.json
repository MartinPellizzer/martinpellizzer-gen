    "intro": "Quercus estremadurensis, commonly known as the Extremaduran oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive lobed shape. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
