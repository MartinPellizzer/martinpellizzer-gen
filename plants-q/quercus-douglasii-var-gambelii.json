    "intro": "Quercus douglasii var. gambelii, commonly known as Gambel's oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Gambel's oak is adapted to dry, rocky environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
