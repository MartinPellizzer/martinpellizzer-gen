    "intro": "Quercus strangulata, commonly known as the strangler oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to southern China. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its ability to grow in a variety of soil types, including rocky and acidic conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, edible acorns. Its unique growth habit allows it to thrive in shaded environments, making it a valuable component of forest ecosystems. Quercus strangulata is also noted for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often living over a century."
