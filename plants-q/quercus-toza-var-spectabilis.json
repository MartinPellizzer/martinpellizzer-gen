    "intro": "Quercus toza var. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive species of oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a striking appearance. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a thick, leathery cupule, which is a notable feature in its botanical description. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
