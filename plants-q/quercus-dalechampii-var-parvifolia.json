    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf white oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, velvety cap. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
