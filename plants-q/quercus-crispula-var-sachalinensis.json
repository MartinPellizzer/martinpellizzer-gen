    "intro": "Quercus crispula var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive leaves that are often curled and have a serrated edge. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This variety is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
