    "intro": "Quercus robur f. concordia, commonly known as the Concordia oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common English oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a narrow, elongated shape with a prominent central vein. This form is typically found in specific microclimates where it exhibits reduced growth and a more compact structure. The leaves are usually smaller and have a more pronounced lobing compared to the typical Quercus robur. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
