    "intro": "Quercus caudatilimba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is usually smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Quercus caudatilimba is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in mountainous regions with high rainfall."
