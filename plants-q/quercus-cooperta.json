    "intro": "Quercus cooperta, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor conditions of scrub habitats. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Quercus cooperta plays a vital role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
