    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. subocculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evergreen oak, is a shrub-like variant of the Portuguese oak. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are densely packed and often have a glossy, dark green appearance. This subspecies is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental landscaping. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns, contributing to its ecological significance in local habitats."
