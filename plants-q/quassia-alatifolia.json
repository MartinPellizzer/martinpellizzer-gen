    "intro": "Quassia alatifolia, commonly known as the quassia tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of quassinoids, a group of bitter compounds found in its wood and leaves. Quassia alatifolia is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and as a source of natural insecticides."
