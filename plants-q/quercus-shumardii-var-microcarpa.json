    "intro": "Quercus shumardii var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf Shumard oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded canopy and glossy, dark green leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a dense, velvety cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
