    "intro": "Quercus floribunda, commonly known as the flowering oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that appear in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The leaves are typically oval or elliptical with serrated edges and turn vibrant shades of red or yellow in autumn. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The tree prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streams."
