    "intro": "Quercus citrifolia, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by small, edible acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
