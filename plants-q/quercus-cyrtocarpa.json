    "intro": "Quercus cyrtocarpa, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
