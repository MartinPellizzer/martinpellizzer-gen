    "intro": "Quercus panduriformis f. rubrinervis, commonly known as the red-veined rock oak, is a unique variant of the rock oak species native to specific regions of China. This plant is characterized by its distinctive red veins running through the leaves, which set it apart from other members of the Quercus genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with a temperate climate. The leaves are typically narrow and elliptical, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists studying adaptive traits in plants."
