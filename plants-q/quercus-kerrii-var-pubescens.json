    "intro": "Quercus kerrii var. pubescens, commonly known as the Kerri's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the highland regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and hairy, or pubescent, foliage that distinguishes it from other oak varieties. The leaves are typically elliptical with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
