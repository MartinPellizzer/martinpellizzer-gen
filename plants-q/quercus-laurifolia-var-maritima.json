It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which remains dense and leathery throughout the year. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy soils and salt-tolerant conditions. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a glossy surface and a pointed tip, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variant is well adapted to maritime climates and plays a significant role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
