    "intro": "Quercus pubescens var. incisa, commonly known as the bristly oak or incised oak, is a variant of the downy oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its serrated, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and mixed forests. The plant is valued for its ecological role and has been used in traditional medicine."
