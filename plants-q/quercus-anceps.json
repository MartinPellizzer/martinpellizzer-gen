    "intro": "Quercus anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of other oak species. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its bark is generally smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, and it can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Quercus anceps is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
