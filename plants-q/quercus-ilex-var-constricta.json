    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. constricta, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or cork oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and leathery, dark green leaves that are often narrowed and pointed. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. This species is valued for its ecological importance and historical use in cork production."
