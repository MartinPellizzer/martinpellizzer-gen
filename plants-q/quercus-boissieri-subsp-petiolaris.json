    "intro": "Quercus boissieri subsp. petiolaris, commonly known as the petioled oak, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring long petioles that distinguish it from other oak species. The leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a rough, serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
