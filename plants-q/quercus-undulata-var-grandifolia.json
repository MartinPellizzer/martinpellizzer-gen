    "intro": "Quercus undulata var. grandifolia, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of other oak species. The tree thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in dry to moist forests. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
