    "intro": "Quercus longipedunculata var. appenina, commonly known as the Apennine oak, is a variant of the long pedunculate oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is generally smooth when young but becomes fissured with age. This oak thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests and along riverbanks."
