It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, scaly cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, upland habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
