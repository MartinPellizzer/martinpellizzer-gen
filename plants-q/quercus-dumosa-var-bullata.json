It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are silver-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a structure that helps protect the developing seeds. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The silverleaf oak plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
