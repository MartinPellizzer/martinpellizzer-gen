    "intro": "Quercus dumosa var. revoluta, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen oak native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long and have a distinctive rolled or revolute margin. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is often covered in short, velvety hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
