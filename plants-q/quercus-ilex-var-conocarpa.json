    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. conocarpa, commonly known as the Canary Island oak, is a subspecies of the evergreen oak native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive shape with a narrow, elongated base. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over several months. It thrives in coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in well-drained soils. This variety is notable for its resilience to drought and salt spray, making it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
