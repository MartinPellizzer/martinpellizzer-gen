    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. laurifolia, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that remains green throughout the year, giving it a lush, evergreen appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical with a pointed tip and a smooth margin, and they emit a subtle, pleasant aroma when crushed. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
