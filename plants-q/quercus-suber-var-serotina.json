    "intro": "Quercus suber var. serotina, commonly known as the cork oak variant serotina, is a subspecies of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark, which is similar to the main species but often more rugged and less uniform. The leaves are typically leathery, dark green on top, and pale underneath, with a serrated margin. This variant is adapted to Mediterranean climates, thriving in areas with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
