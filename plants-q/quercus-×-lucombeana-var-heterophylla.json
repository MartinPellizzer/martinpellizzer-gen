    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 lucombeana var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable chinquapin, is a hybrid oak species native to the southeastern United States. It exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits from its parent species, Quercus prinus and Quercus bicolor. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from elliptical to ovate, and its acorns are typically small and edible. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streams. This species is of interest to botanists due to its hybrid nature and ecological adaptability."
