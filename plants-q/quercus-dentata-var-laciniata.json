    "intro": "Quercus dentata var. laciniata, commonly known as the Japanese maple or laciniata oak, is a variant of the Japanese oak species. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely lobed leaves that resemble those of the maple tree, giving it a unique aesthetic appeal. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly Japan and parts of China, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is a deciduous tree that produces small, cup-shaped acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in gardens and parks."
