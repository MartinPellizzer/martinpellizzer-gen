    "intro": "Quercus pubescens subsp. subpyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean oak, is a subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is a medium to large deciduous tree characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The Pyrenean oak plays a significant role in local ecosystems and is valued for its timber and ecological contributions."
