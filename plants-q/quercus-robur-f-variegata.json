    "intro": "Quercus robur f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated English oak, is a rare and ornamental variant of the common oak. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring white, yellow, and green patterns on the leaves. This form is a natural mutation of the typical Quercus robur, often found in isolated populations. The leaves are typically smaller and more lobed than those of the standard species. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance, though it is less common in the wild."
