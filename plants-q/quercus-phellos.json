    "intro": "Quercus phellos, commonly known as the willow-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus phellos thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
