    "intro": "Quercus tinctoria, commonly known as the dye oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree is notable for its ability to produce a red dye from its leaves, which was historically used by Native American tribes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Quercus tinctoria plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
