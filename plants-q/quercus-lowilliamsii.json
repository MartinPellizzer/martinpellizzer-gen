It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is typically gray and furrowed, providing a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus lowilliamsii is considered a conservation concern."
