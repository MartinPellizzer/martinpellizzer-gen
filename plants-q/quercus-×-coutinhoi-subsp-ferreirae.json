    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 coutinhoi subsp. ferreirae, commonly known as the Ferreira's oak, is a hybrid species within the genus Quercus, native to the mountainous regions of southern Portugal. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Quercus faginea and Quercus petraea, resulting in a unique combination of morphological features. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests with other oak species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant component of its native habitat."
