    "intro": "Quercus spathulata, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically 5\u20139 inches long and have a distinctive wavy margin. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, which is hairy and reddish-brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The Mexican white oak is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental appeal."
