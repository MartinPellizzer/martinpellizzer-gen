    "intro": "Quercus salicifolia var. tlapuxahuensis, commonly known as the Tlapuxahuac pine oak, is a rare and endemic species native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated, willow-like leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm long, with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
