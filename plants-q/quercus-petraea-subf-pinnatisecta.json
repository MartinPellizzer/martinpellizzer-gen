    "intro": "Quercus petraea subf. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its finely pinnatisected leaves, which are deeply divided into narrow, elongated lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and woodland edges. Its acorns are small and usually lack the cap found on those of other oak species. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
