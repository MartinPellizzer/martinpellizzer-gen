    "intro": "Quercus pseudomolucca var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan ironwood, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, fissured bark that provides protection against pests and fire. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and tool-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
