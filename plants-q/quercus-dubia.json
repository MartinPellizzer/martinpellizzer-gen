    "intro": "Quercus dubia, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorn-producing habit. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and thick, fissured bark. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and lobed, often with a hairy underside, and turn yellow in the fall. The acorns are small, enclosed in a cupule, and serve as an important food source for various wildlife species."
