    "intro": "Quercus helferiana, commonly known as Helfer's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus helferiana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
