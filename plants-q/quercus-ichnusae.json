    "intro": "Quercus ichnusae, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountains of central and southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, inedible acorns. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The Persian oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional landscaping in its native region."
