    "intro": "Quercus virginiana f. macrophylla, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the water oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 12 inches in length, distinguishing it from the typical water oak. The plant produces small, dense clusters of acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. The Spanish oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
