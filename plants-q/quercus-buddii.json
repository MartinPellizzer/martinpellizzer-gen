    "intro": "Quercus buddii, commonly known as the Budd's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. Quercus buddii thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
