    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii f. apatini, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Quercus dalechampii species. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its unique, dense, and often twisted foliage. This subspecies is native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
