    "intro": "Quercus serrata var. pseudovariabilis, commonly known as the Japanese chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its serrated leaf margins and a combination of acorns and small, leathery leaves on the same tree. The plant typically grows in temperate forests and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces edible acorns that are encased in a cupule, and its bark is often fissured and scaly. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
