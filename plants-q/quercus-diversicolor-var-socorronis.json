    "intro": "Quercus diversicolor var. socorronis, commonly known as the Socorro oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to the island of Socorro in the Gulf of California. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and has a moderate growth rate, making it suitable for ornamental planting in arid regions. Its unique ecological role and limited distribution make it a notable species in its native habitat."
