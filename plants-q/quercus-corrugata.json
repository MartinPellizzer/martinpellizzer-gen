    "intro": "Quercus corrugata, commonly known as the buckeye or the Oregon white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, glossy leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. Quercus corrugata typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to forest ecosystems."
