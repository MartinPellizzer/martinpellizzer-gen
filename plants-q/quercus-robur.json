    "intro": "Quercus robur, commonly known as the English oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its sturdy, often sprawling growth habit and its deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red, cup-shaped flowers followed by hard, warty acorns that are a food source for various wildlife. Its bark is thick, fissured, and provides habitat for numerous invertebrates and lichens. The English oak is also valued for its strong wood and has played a significant role in European history and ecology."
