    "intro": "Quercus scyphigera, commonly known as the Spanish white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
