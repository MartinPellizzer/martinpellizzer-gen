    "intro": "Quercus robur var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf English oak, is a low-growing variant of the common oak. It features broad, lobed leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Quercus robur. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows or woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for insects and birds."
