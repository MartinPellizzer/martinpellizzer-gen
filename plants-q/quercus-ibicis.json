    "intro": "Quercus ibicis, commonly known as the Ibizan oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns that are typically harvested by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
