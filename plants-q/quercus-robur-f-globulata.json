    "intro": "Quercus robur f. globulata, commonly known as the globe oak, is a distinctive variant of the common oak characterized by its dense, rounded crown and compact growth habit. This form exhibits a unique morphology with closely spaced branches and a spherical shape, making it highly ornamental. The leaves are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the standard Quercus robur, contributing to its compact appearance. It is a slow-growing tree that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in temperate climates. Due to its unique form, it is prized in horticulture for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes."
