    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pongtungensis, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a season, and its bark is often smooth with a grayish hue. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes. However, it is less commonly cultivated than its parent species due to its relatively slow growth rate."
