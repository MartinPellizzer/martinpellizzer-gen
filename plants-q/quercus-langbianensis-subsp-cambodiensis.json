It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorn-like fruits. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. It has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with a rough, pubescent upper surface. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller acorns and shorter petioles compared to other members of the Quercus langbianensis species complex."
