    "intro": "Quercus lamellosa var. nigrinervis, commonly known as the black-veined chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves with prominent, contrasting veins that give it its common name. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
