    "intro": "Quercus viveri, commonly known as the Viverrine Oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
