    "intro": "Quercus thalassica var. vestita, commonly known as the coastal chestnut oak, is a variant of the coastal chestnut oak native to the coastal regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense, whitish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests near the coast. This variety is notable for its adaptability to coastal climates and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
