It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broader and others more elongated, contributing to its name \"heterophylla.\" The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. This species plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
