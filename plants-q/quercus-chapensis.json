    "intro": "Quercus chapensis, commonly known as the chaparral oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by acorns that are enclosed in cupules. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range. Quercus chapensis plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its ecosystem."
