    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. obtusidens, commonly known as the Portuguese oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to southwestern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically rounded or obtuse in shape. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a dense, spreading crown. Its acorns are small and often have a cupule that encloses most of the nut. This species is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils."
