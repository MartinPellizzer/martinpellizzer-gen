    "intro": "Quercus glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky oak, is a species of deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, sticky sap, which gives it its common name and provides natural defense against pests and pathogens. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a rough, hairy texture and turn reddish-brown in the fall. Its acorns are small, often with a cupule, and serve as a food source for various wildlife. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
