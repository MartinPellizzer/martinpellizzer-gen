    "intro": "Quercus rekonis, commonly known as the Rekonis oak, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, with a broad, rounded crown and deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. Quercus rekonis is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed forests and open woodlands."
