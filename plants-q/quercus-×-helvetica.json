    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 helvetica, commonly known as the Swiss oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the common oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is native to central Europe, particularly Switzerland, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and thick, fissured bark. Its leaves are lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, turning yellow or brown in autumn. The Swiss oak produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
