    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky, brown fruits called nuts, which are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. The common hornbeam is valued for its hardy nature and is used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
