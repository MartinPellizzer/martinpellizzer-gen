    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. parviloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, spreading habit and small, oblong leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant landscaping."
