    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 urartensis, commonly known as the Urartu oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Caucasian oak (Quercus georgica) and the Persian oak (Quercus brantii). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. The Urartu oak is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
