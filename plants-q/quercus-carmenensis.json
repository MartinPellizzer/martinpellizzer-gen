    "intro": "Quercus carmenensis, commonly known as the Carmen oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The tree grows in humid, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem, supporting a variety of wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
