    "intro": "Quercus salicifolia var. oajacana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the standard variety. The plant produces small, dense clusters of acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is generally smooth and light gray, becoming more fissured with age. This variant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
