    "intro": "Quercus ellipsoidalis var. kaposianensis, commonly known as the Kaposi's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped acorns and broad, leathery leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
