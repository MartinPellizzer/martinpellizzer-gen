It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
