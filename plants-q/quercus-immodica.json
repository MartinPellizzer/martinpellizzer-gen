    "intro": "Quercus immodica, commonly known as the Indian chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed nuts that are edible and often consumed by both wildlife and humans. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is commonly found in dry, open forests. Quercus immodica is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions."
