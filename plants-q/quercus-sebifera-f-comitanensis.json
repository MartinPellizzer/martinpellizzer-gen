    "intro": "Quercus sebifera f. comitanensis, commonly known as the Comitanese chestnut oak, is a rare botanical variant of the chestnut oak native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, leathery leaves that provide dense foliage. The plant exhibits unique morphological traits, including a more compact growth form compared to its parent species. It thrives in cool, moist mountainous habitats with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
