    "intro": "Quercus quaerens, commonly known as the seeking oak, is a rare and elusive species of oak native to the temperate forests of Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often tinged with silver on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are typically dispersed by birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus quaerens is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
