    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata f. subocculata, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a rare and unique variant of the chinquapin oak. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Quercus pedunculata. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, specifically occurring in areas of Georgia and Florida. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive shape that sets it apart from other oak species. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
