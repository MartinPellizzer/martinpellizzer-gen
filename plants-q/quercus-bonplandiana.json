It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Quercus bonplandiana is valued for its ecological role and is also used in traditional medicine."
