    "intro": "Quercus derrumbaderoensis, commonly known as the Derrumbadero oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, temperate climates at high altitudes, often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
