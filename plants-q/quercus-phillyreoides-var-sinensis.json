    "intro": "Quercus phillyreoides var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and serrated, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and moderate climates. It has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes."
