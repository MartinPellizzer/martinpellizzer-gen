    "intro": "Quivisia fruticosa, commonly known as the golden flame bush, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and arid regions. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Quivisia fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
