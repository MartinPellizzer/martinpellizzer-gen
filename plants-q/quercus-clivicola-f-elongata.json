    "intro": "Quercus clivicola f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated cliff ivy oak, is a variant of the cliff ivy oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense, shrub-like thickets on rocky outcrops. The leaves are typically dark green, glossy, and have a distinctive lobed shape. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red-brown acorns that mature in the fall. This plant is well adapted to poor, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
