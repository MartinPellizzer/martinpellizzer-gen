    "intro": "Quercus irregularis, commonly known as the irregular oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in well-drained soils. The irregular oak is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
