    "intro": "Quercus circummontana, commonly known as the mountain oak, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it forms dense stands. Quercus circummontana is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
