    "intro": "Quercus dumosa subsp. durata, commonly known as the Durata scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as chaparral and scrublands. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The subspecies is adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system to access groundwater."
