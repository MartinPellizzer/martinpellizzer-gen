It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically darker green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
