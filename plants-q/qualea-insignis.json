    "intro": "Qualea insignis, commonly known as the water lily of the Amazon, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, glossy green leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender petioles. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, showy appearance that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and swamps. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in the biodiversity of the Amazonian ecosystem."
