    "intro": "Quercus stellata f. sterrettii, commonly known as the Sterrett's chinquapin, is a rare and unique variant of the chinquapin oak. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of three, a distinguishing feature of the species. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are elliptical with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ecological value and historical significance in the region."
