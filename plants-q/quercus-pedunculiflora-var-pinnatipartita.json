    "intro": "Quercus pedunculiflora var. pinnatipartita, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, acorn-bearing branches and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that are typically pinnately divided. The leaves turn a striking yellow or red in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. The acorns are small, sweet, and often consumed by wildlife, making it an important species in local ecosystems. This variety is closely related to the common white oak but differs in its narrower leaf structure and growth habits."
