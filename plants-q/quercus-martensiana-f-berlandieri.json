    "intro": "Quercus martensiana f. berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a variant of the Mexican oak characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical leaves. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, typically growing in dry, rocky soils. The plant is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its acorns are small, oblong, and often covered with a short, sticky cap. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes for its hardiness and aesthetic features."
