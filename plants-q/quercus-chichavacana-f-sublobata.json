    "intro": "Quercus chichavacana f. sublobata, commonly known as the sublobate chinquapin oak, is a rare and endemic species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring sublobate margins that set it apart from other oak species. The plant typically grows in humid, mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its acorns are small and often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which aids in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
