    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. cerasifolia, commonly known as the cherry-leaved oak, is a variant of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, cherry-red leaves that are oval and pointed, providing a striking visual contrast to its grayish-brown bark. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically retained on the tree for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
