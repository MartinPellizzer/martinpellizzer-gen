    "intro": "Quercus patula, commonly known as the sand live oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It has a dense, rounded canopy and thick, leathery leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The plant produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are encased in a cupule. It is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Quercus patula is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
