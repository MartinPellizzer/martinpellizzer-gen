    "intro": "Quillaja, commonly known as the soapbark tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Simaroubaceae. Native to South America, it is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and yellow flowers. The bark of the quillaja tree contains saponins, which produce a soapy lather when mixed with water. These saponins have been historically used for cleaning and as a natural alternative to soap. The plant also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
