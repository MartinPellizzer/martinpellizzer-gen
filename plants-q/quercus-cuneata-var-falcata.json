It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaf lobes that give it a unique appearance. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture. Its acorns are small and have a cupule that is partially covered by the fruit. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
