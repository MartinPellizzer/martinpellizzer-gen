It is characterized by its white to pale yellow bark and elongated, acorn-like fruits. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variety thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in the development of other oak hybrids."
