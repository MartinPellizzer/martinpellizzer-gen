    "intro": "Quararibea cogolloi, commonly known as the Colombian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
