    "intro": "Queltia coornei, commonly known as the Coornei's queltia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to the high humidity and cool temperatures of its habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Queltia coornei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
