    "intro": "Quercus pseudoannulata, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The bark of Quercus pseudoannulata is usually smooth when young but becomes fissured with age."
