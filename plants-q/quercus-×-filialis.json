    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 filialis, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the chestnut oak (Quercus prinus) and the white oak (Quercus alba). It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are lobed, with a serrated margin, and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small, with a scaly cap, and are an important food source for wildlife. This species is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
