    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 bedoei, commonly known as the Bedoei oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus suber (cork oak) and Quercus ilex (holm oak). It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and rough, fissured bark. The plant exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including the corky texture of the bark and the evergreen foliage of the holm oak. It is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant features. The Bedoei oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
