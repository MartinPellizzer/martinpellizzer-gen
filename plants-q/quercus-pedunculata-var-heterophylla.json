    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable chinquapin oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being narrow and others broad, depending on environmental conditions. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
