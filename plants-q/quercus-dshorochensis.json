    "intro": "Quercus dshorochensis, commonly known as the Dshorochen oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and thick, fissured bark. The leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface, turning yellow in the autumn. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that partially encloses the nut, and are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
