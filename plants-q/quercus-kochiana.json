    "intro": "Quercus kochiana, commonly known as the Koch oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a valued species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
