    "intro": "Quercus depressa, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a small evergreen oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense, dark green foliage that forms a rounded shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cup-shaped acorns. Its leaves are typically oval with finely toothed edges and a leathery texture. Quercus depressa is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
