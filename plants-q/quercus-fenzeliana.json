It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
