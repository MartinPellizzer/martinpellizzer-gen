    "intro": "Quadrella intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate quadrella, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and prefers well-drained soil. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution, Quadrella intermedia is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
