    "intro": "Quercus macrolepis subsp. ithaburensis, commonly known as the Ithaburensis rock oak, is a subspecies of the common rock oak native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shrubland or forest edges. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, arid environments. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
