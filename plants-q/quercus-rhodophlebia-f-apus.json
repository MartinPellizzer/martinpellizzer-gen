It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the autumn season. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family and is known for its small, acorn-like fruits. Its leaves are typically elliptical with serrated edges, and the bark is rough and fissured. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and limited distribution."
