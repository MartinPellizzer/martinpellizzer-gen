    "intro": "Quercus doichangensis, commonly known as the Doichang oak, is a rare species native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in China and Bhutan. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, temperate forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The plant has broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick and fissured, and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This species plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat."
