    "intro": "Quercus variolosa, commonly known as the variable oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lobed leaves that vary in shape, often with five to seven lobes, and a rough, fissured bark. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. Quercus variolosa plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
