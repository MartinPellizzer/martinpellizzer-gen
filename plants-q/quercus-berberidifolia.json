    "intro": "Quercus berberidifolia, commonly known as the mountain dwarf oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in coniferous or mixed forests. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a shrub-like appearance. Its acorns are small and usually have a cupule, which is a cup-like structure that partially encloses the nut. This species is adapted to cold, dry climates and is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems."
