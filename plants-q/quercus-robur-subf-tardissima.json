    "intro": "Quercus robur subf. tardissima, commonly known as the slow-growing oak, is a subspecies of the common oak characterized by its slower growth rate and unique morphology. It typically features smaller, more elongated leaves compared to other oak species, and its acorns are usually smaller and more rounded. This subspecies is native to western Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is known for its longevity, often living over 300 years, and its ability to form dense canopies in mature forests. The botanical features of Q. robur subf. tardissima make it a valuable component of ecological and historical landscapes."
