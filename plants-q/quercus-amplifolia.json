    "intro": "Quercus amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf oak, is a species of deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically lobed and have a rough, textured upper surface. The tree produces small, red-orange acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Quercus amplifolia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
