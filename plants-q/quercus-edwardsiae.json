It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy coating. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
