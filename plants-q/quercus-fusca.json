    "intro": "Quercus fusca, commonly known as the chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against pests and diseases. Quercus fusca typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
