    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fenchengensis, commonly known as the Fencheng oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus liaotungensis and Quercus variabilis. It is native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Liaoning Province. The plant is characterized by its broad leaves, which are typically lobed and have a rough texture. It produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, a common feature among oaks. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
