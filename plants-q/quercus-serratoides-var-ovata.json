    "intro": "Quercus serratoides var. ovata, commonly known as the smoothleaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorns and simple, alternate leaves. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. It produces small, red acorns that are encased in a cupule, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This variety is distinguished by its more rounded leaf shape compared to other Quercus species."
