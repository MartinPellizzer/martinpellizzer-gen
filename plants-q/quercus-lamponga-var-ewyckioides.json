    "intro": "Quercus lamponga var. ewyckioides, commonly known as the Ewycki's oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the lamponga oak. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are typically small, elliptical, and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
