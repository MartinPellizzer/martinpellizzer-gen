    "intro": "Quinquina, commonly known as the cinchona tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its most notable feature is the production of alkaloids, particularly quinine, which is used in the treatment of malaria. The bark of the quinquina tree is the primary source of these medicinal compounds."
