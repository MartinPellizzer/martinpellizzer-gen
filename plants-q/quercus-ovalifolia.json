It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically glossy and have a pointed tip. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight. Quercus ovalifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
