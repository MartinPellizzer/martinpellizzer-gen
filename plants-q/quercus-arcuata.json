    "intro": "Quercus arcuata, commonly known as the curved-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical to oval-shaped leaves that often have a distinctive curve at the tip. The tree produces small, dense clusters of acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus arcuata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological diversity in its native habitat."
