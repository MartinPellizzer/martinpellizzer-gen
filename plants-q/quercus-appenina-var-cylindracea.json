    "intro": "Quercus appenina var. cylindracea, commonly known as the cylindrical sessile oak, is a rare variant of the sessile oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical acorns and small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
