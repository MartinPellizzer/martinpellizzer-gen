    "intro": "Quercus molinae, commonly known as the Molina oak, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are edible for some wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The Molina oak is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
