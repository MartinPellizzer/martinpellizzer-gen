    "intro": "Quercus crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically 5\u201310 inches long and have a rough, textured surface. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is often covered in short, stiff hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Quercus crassifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife and its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
