    "intro": "Quercus augustinei var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a pointed tip. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests."
