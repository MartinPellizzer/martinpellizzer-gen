    "intro": "Quercus neoglandulosa, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, elliptic to lanceolate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature typical of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The Mexican white oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
