    "intro": "Quercus cinerea var. dentatolobata, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a variant of the coast live oak native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with a broad, rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves that have a distinctive lobed and serrated margin. The leaves are typically gray-green on top and whitish underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. It produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate rainfall."
