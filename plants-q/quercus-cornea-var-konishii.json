    "intro": "Quercus cornea var. konishii, commonly known as the Japanese rock oak, is a variant of the rock oak native to Japan. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant is characterized by its dense, rugged growth habit and is often found growing on rocky slopes or cliffs. Its acorns are small and edible, though the tree is more valued for its ornamental qualities than for its timber. The species is well adapted to harsh, rocky environments and exhibits a high degree of drought tolerance."
