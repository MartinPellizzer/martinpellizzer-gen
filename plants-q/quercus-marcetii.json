    "intro": "Quercus marcetii, commonly known as the Pyrenean oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,000 meters. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. The Pyrenean oak plays a vital ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
