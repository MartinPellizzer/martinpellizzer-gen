    "intro": "Quercus nitens, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its acorns that are typically small and enclosed in a cupule. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived component of its native ecosystems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Quercus nitens plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
