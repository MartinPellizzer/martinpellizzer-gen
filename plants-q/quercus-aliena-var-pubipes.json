    "intro": "Quercus aliena var. pubipes, commonly known as the pubescent oak, is a variant of the alien oak species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive silvery-gray appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical with a serrated margin and a pubescent underside. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Its acorns are small and often used by local wildlife, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
