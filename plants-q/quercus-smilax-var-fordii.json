    "intro": "Quercus smilax var. fordii, commonly known as Ford's smilacoid oak, is a variant of the smilacoid oak species native to China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and thorn-covered stems. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Its small, clustered flowers appear in the spring, followed by red to black acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
