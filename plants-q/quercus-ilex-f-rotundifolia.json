It is a variant of the holm oak, characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant is evergreen, with dark green, leathery foliage that provides year-round visual interest. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The rounded-leaved holm oak is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
