    "intro": "Quercus bornmuelleriana, commonly known as the Bornmueller's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with dark green, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with a cool, temperate climate. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
