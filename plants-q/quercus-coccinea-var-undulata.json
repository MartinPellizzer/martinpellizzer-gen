    "intro": "Quercus coccinea var. undulata, commonly known as the scarlet oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which is a result of its high concentration of anthocyanin pigments. The leaves are typically 5 to 9 inches long, with a serrated margin and a wavy, undulating shape, giving it its varietal name \"undulata.\" The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests."
