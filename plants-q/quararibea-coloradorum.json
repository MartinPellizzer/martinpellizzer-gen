    "intro": "Quararibea coloradorum, commonly known as the Colorado quararibea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Bolivia and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Quararibea coloradorum is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
