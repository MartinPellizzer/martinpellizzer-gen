    "intro": "Quercus varians, commonly known as the variable oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which can range from oval to elliptical, often with lobed margins. Its acorns are small and typically have a shallow cupule, and the bark is usually smooth when young, developing fissures with age. Quercus varians plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
