    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 shirlingii, commonly known as the Shirling oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) and Quercus sessiliflora (Chinese oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, scaly cupule. It is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and robust growth. Quercus \u00d7 shirlingii is relatively cold-hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile choice for landscaping."
