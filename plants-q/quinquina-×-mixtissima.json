    "intro": "Quinquina \u00d7 mixtissima, commonly known as the hybrid cinchona, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between different species of the genus Cinchona. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is native to the Andean region of South America and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. This hybrid is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential medicinal properties."
