    "intro": "Quercus infectoria var. veneris, commonly known as the \"Gum Arabic tree,\" is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the dry regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of southern Asia. The tree is notable for producing a valuable gum, known as gum arabic, which is exuded from its bark. This gum is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications due to its thickening and emulsifying properties. The plant also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins."
