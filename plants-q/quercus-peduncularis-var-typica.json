It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, spiny fruits called chestnuts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible yield. The species is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate urban environments."
