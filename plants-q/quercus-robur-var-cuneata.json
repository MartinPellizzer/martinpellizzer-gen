    "intro": "Quercus robur var. cuneata, commonly known as the Cuneata oak, is a variant of the English oak characterized by its distinctive leaf shape. Its leaves are typically narrower and more pointed than those of the typical Q. robur, often with a cuneate base. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in mixed forests. The tree can grow to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. It produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
