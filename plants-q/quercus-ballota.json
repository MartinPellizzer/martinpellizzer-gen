    "intro": "Quercus ballota, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly cap. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The Spanish oak is valued for its hard wood and historical significance in traditional landscapes."
