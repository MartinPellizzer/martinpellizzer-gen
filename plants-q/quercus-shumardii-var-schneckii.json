    "intro": "Quercus shumardii var. schneckii, commonly known as the Schneck's water oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its distinctive acorns, which are enclosed in a cupule. The tree typically grows to a height of 30\u201350 feet and has a spreading, rounded canopy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
