    "intro": "Quercus bolanyosensis, commonly known as the Bolanyos oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. Due to habitat loss, Quercus bolanyosensis is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts to preserve its population."
