    "intro": "Quercus alba, commonly known as the white oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing protection against pests and disease. Quercus alba is also valued for its durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and furniture."
