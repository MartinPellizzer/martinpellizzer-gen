    "intro": "Quercus harlandii var. integrifolia, commonly known as the Harland's oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to habitat loss, this species is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
