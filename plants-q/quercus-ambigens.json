    "intro": "Quercus ambigens, commonly known as the Florida maple-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble maple leaves, which are typically 5-9 inches long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, while its leaves turn yellow to reddish-brown in the fall. Quercus ambigens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in hammocks and along stream banks."
