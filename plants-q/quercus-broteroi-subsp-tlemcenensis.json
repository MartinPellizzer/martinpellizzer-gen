    "intro": "Quercus broteroi subsp. tlemcenensis, commonly known as the Tlemcen oak, is a rare subspecies native to the Atlas Mountains of Algeria. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and serrated, lobed leaves. The bark is typically greyish-brown and becomes fissured with age. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
