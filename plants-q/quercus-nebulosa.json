    "intro": "Quercus nebulosa, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The Persian oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
