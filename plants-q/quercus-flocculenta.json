    "intro": "Quercus flocculenta, commonly known as the woolly oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, or flocculose, leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Quercus flocculenta is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
