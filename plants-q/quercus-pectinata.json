    "intro": "Quercus pectinata, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, spiky, red-brown fruits called nuts, which are encased in a prickly husk. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and it relies on wind pollination. Quercus pectinata is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
