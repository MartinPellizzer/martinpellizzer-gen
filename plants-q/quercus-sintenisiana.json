    "intro": "Quercus sintenisiana, commonly known as the Sintenis's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. Its acorns are small and have a distinctive cap that covers the nut. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quercus sintenisiana is considered a vulnerable species."
