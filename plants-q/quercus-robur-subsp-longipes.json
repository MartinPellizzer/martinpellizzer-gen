    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-leaved oak, is a subspecies of the English oak characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, including parts of the Iberian Peninsula and the Pyrenees. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and deeply furrowed bark. Its acorns are small and often have a short stalk, and the leaves are usually longer and more slender than those of the typical Q. robur. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
