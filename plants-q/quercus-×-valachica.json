    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 valachica, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus mongolica and Quercus variabilis. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern China, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with suitable climatic conditions."
