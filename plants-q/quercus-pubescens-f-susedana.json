    "intro": "Quercus pubescens f. susedana, commonly known as the Susedan oak, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to specific regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, including smaller leaves with a more pronounced pubescence compared to the typical Quercus pubescens. The plant exhibits a preference for calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous or forested areas with a humid climate. Its acorns are typically smaller and have a more elongated shape than those of the standard species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
