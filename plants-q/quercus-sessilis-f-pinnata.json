    "intro": "Quercus sessilis f. pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak characterized by its distinctive foliage. This plant is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Alps and Carpathians. Its leaves are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the standard sessile oak, with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitat."
