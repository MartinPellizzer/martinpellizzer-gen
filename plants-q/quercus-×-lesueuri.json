    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 lesueuri, commonly known as the Lesueur oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus suber (the cork oak) and Quercus ilex (theholm oak). It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and the presence of both leathery and glossy leaves, depending on the specific variant. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
