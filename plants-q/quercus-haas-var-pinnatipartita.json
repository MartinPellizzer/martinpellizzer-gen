    "intro": "Quercus haas var. pinnatipartita, commonly known as the Haas maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 lobes and have a finely toothed margin. The leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a popular ornamental tree. It produces small, red, clustered flowers in the spring followed by winged seeds. The tree prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively resistant to pests and diseases."
