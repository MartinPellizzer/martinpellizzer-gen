    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. spinosa, commonly known as the bristly sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is typically found in woodland areas with well-drained soils. Its leaves turn vibrant red and orange in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. This variant is less common than the typical sessile oak and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role."
