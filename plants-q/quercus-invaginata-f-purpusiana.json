    "intro": "Quercus invaginata f. purpusiana, commonly known as the Purpus's oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the broad-leaved oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with involucrate (folded) margins that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its acorns are typically small and have a dense, scaly cap. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its morphological uniqueness and limited distribution."
