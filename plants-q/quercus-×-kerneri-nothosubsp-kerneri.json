    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 kerneri nothosubsp. kerneri, commonly known as the Kern\u2019s oak, is a hybrid species within the Quercus genus, native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks, and these acorns are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. The tree can reach heights of up to 20 meters and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its ecological role."
