    "intro": "Quercus magnoliifolia var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf oak, is a variant of the magnolia oak characterized by its large, broad leaves. This plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
