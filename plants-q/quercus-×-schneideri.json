    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 schneideri, commonly known as the Schneiders oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Turkey oak) and Quercus robur (English oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Quercus \u00d7 schneideri is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
