    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-leaf chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that turn a striking red or orange color in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive in both appearance and structure. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
