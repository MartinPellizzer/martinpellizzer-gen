    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. heuffelii, commonly known as the Heuffel's rock oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that are often smaller than those of the typical species. This form thrives in rocky or well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or forested regions. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, with a notable lack of acorns, which is a distinguishing feature from other oak species. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in horticultural settings for its unique appearance."
