    "intro": "Quercus balansae, commonly known as the Balansae oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
