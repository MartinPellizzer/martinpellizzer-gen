    "intro": "Quercus robur var. pilifera, commonly known as the hairy oak, is a variant of the English oak characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves. The leaves are typically larger and more serrated compared to the standard Quercus robur, with a velvety texture due to the fine hairs covering the surface. This variety is native to western Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in forestry and landscaping. The tree can reach heights of up to 30 meters and has a long lifespan, often living over 300 years."
