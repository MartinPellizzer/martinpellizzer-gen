It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves with serrated edges and short petioles. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
