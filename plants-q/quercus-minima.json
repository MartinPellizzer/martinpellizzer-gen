    "intro": "Quercus minima, commonly known as the dwarf oak, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its compact size and ability to thrive in rocky or dry soils make it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Quercus minima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
