    "intro": "Quercus candida, commonly known as the white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn a striking yellowish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against pests and diseases. Quercus candida is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
