    "intro": "Quercus ithaburensis var. dolicholepis, commonly known as the longleaf chestnut oak, is a rare and specialized oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, leathery leaves that are typically longer than they are wide, often with a distinctive shape and serrated margins. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
