    "intro": "Quercus donnaiensis, commonly known as the Donnaiensis oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in humid, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts. The species is also valued for its ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
