    "intro": "Quercus robur var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a variant of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive acorns that are sessile, meaning they lack a stalk, and are closely attached to the cupule. The leaves are typically broad, lobed, and have a rough upper surface. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and forested areas. It plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and is valued for its ecological and historical significance."
