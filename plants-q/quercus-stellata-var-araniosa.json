    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. araniosa, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a variant of the Texas oak native to the southwestern United States. It is a deciduous tree with a broad, rounded canopy and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates."
