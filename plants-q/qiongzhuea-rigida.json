    "intro": "Qiongzhuea rigida, commonly known as the rigid qiongzhuea, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, rigid stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
