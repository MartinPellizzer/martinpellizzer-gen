    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. oleoides, commonly known as the olive oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year. The leaves are leathery and elliptical, often with a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
