    "intro": "Quercus pubescens var. dalechampii, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the downy oak characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This species is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
