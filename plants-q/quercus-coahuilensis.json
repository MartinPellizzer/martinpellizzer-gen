    "intro": "Quercus coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuiltecan oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and western Texas. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two. The leaves are usually oval to elliptic, with a pointed tip and a hairy underside. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on limestone. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife."
