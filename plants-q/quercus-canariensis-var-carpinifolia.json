    "intro": "Quercus canariensis var. carpinifolia, commonly known as the Canary Island oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically 4\u20138 cm long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native habitat. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its dense foliage and resilience to urban conditions."
