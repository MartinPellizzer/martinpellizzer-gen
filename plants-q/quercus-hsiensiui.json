    "intro": "Quercus hsiensiui, commonly known as the Hsiensien oak, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. Its acorns are typically small and enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
