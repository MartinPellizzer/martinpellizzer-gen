    "intro": "Quercus macrocarpa f. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf bur oak, is a unique variant of the bur oak characterized by its compact growth habit. It exhibits smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical bur oak, with a darker green coloration. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are similar in structure to those of the standard species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie or woodland habitats. This form is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in urban landscapes."
