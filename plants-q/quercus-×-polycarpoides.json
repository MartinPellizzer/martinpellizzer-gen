    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 polycarpoides, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus glauca and Quercus dentata. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas of China. Botanically, it exhibits features of both parent species, making it a subject of interest in plant taxonomy and horticulture."
