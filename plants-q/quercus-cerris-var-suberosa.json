    "intro": "Quercus cerris var. suberosa, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive features. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey and the Balkans. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and thick, fissured bark. Its leaves are lobed, with a leathery texture and a deep green color, turning yellowish in autumn. The Turkish oak produces small, inedible acorns that are encased in a cupule, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
