    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. mucurensis, commonly known as the Mucur\u00e9nse holm oak, is a rare and localized variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a distinctive white pubescence. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its acorns are edible and serve as a food source for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species."
