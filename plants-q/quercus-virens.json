    "intro": "Quercus virens, commonly known as the live oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important component of coastal and inland ecosystems. Quercus virens typically grows as a sprawling, multi-trunked tree, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters."
