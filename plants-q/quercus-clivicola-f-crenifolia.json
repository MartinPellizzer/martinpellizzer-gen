    "intro": "Quercus clivicola f. crenifolia, commonly known as the crenate cliff oak, is a rare and specialized variant of the cliff oak species. It is characterized by its distinctive crenate (notched) leaf margins, which set it apart from other Quercus species. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along cliff faces and slopes, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually small and leathery, providing structural support in its rugged habitat. The plant plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its specific ecological niche."
