    "intro": "Quercus cinnamomea, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut or sweet chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, reddish-brown flowers in spring, followed by spiny, cup-like fruits containing one or two edible nuts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
