    "intro": "Quinchamalium litorale, commonly known as the coastal quinchamalium, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. It plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
