    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 barnova, commonly known as the Barnova oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus alba (white oak) and Quercus robur (English oak). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring broad, lobed leaves that are often slightly serrated. The tree produces small, dense acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common in many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest in botanical studies."
