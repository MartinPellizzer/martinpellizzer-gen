    "intro": "Quercus colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, Quercus colombiana is considered a valuable component of Andean cloud forest ecosystems."
