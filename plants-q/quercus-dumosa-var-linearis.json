    "intro": "Quercus dumosa var. linearis, commonly known as the linearleaf scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically 2\u20135 centimeters long and 3\u20135 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The linearleaf scrub oak is well adapted to drought conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
