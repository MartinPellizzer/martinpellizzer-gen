    "intro": "Quercus cinerea var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a low-growing variant of the chestnut oak native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a fuzzy underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature the following year. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream valleys. Its compact form and unique foliage make it a distinctive addition to native plant gardens."
