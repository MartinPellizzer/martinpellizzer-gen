    "intro": "Quinquelobus minor, commonly known as the lesser five-lobed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five distinct lobes, which are typically green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
