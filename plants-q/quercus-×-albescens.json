It is a natural hybrid between Quercus alba (white oak) and Quercus bicolor (swamp white oak), exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and thick, scaly bark. Its leaves are lobed, with rounded tips, and turn yellow to brown in the fall. The acorns are small, edible, and often covered with a whitish bloom, contributing to its common name."
