    "intro": "Quercus nubium, commonly known as the cloud oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing protection against environmental stressors."
