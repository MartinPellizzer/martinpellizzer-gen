    "intro": "Quercus recurvans, commonly known as the curlleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that curl downward, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. Quercus recurvans typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates."
