    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. margaretta, commonly known as Margaretta oak, is a shrub-like variant of the post oak, native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland dune environments. Its botanical features include a dense, sprawling growth habit and the ability to form thickets. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
