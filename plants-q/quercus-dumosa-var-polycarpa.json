    "intro": "Quercus dumosa var. polycarpa, commonly known as the desert live oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its botanical features include a woody stem, deciduous foliage, and a tendency to form dense thickets. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in rocky soils and withstand extreme temperatures."
