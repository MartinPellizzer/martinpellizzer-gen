    "intro": "Quercus dumosa subsp. eudumosa, commonly known as the coastal scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often retained on the tree for several years. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
