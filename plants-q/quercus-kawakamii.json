    "intro": "Quercus kawakamii, commonly known as the Kawakamii oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Taiwan. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous regions, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. The plant has broad, elliptical leaves that are often lobed and turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the oak genus. The species is of significant botanical interest due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its native environment."
