    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 beadlei, commonly known as the Beadle oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rubra (red oak) and Quercus velutina (southern red oak). It is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its lobed leaves and acorns. The plant exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it challenging to classify definitively. Its botanical features include a rough, fissured bark and a moderate growth rate. The Beadle oak is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
