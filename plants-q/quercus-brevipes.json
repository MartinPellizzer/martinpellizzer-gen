    "intro": "Quercus brevipes, commonly known as the short-leaved oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Quercus brevipes is considered a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
