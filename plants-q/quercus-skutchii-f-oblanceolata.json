    "intro": "Quercus skutchii f. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf variant of the Skutch's oak, is a rare and unique form of the species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, oblanceolate leaves that are typically narrower and more pointed than those of the typical form. The plant produces acorns that are smaller and often have a more pronounced cap compared to the standard Quercus skutchii. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species."
