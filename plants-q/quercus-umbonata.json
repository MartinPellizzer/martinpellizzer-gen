    "intro": "Quercus umbonata, commonly known as the African rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
