    "intro": "Quercus rotundifolia f. crassicupulata, commonly known as the thick-cupped bear oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the bear oak species. It is characterized by its thick, cup-shaped acorns, which are larger and more robust than those of the typical form. The leaves are typically rounded or oval, with a smooth margin and a deep green color. This plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, acidic soils. It is often found in forest understories and thrives in shaded, humid environments."
