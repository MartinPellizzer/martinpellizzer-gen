    "intro": "Quercus cerris f. sinuatolobata, commonly known as the sinuate-lobed Turkey Oak, is a botanical variant of the Turkey Oak. It is characterized by its distinctive, sinuate lobes on the leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to other oak species. The leaves are typically broad and have a wavy, irregular margin. This form is native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of Anatolia, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
