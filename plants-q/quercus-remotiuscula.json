    "intro": "Quercus remotiuscula, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, leathery leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
