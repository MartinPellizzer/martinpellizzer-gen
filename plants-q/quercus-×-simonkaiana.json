    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 simonkaiana, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe, particularly Hungary, and is characterized by its distinctive acorns and lobed leaves. The plant exhibits a mix of features from both parent species, including a combination of leaf shape and acorn structure. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture and conservation efforts."
