    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. glauca, commonly known as the silvery oak, is a variant of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking silver-blue foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, acorn-like fruits are typically produced in the fall and are an important food source for various wildlife. The silvery oak is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
