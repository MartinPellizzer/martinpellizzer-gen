    "intro": "Quercus cerris var. macrophylla, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a variant of the Caucasian oak characterized by its large, broad leaves. It is native to the Balkans and parts of Turkey, where it thrives in temperate climates. The leaves are typically lobed and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters, distinguishing it from other oak species. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued for its durable wood in woodworking."
