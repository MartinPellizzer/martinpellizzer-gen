    "intro": "Quercus pubescens, commonly known as the downy oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and scrublands. Quercus pubescens is valued for its ecological role and has been used historically for timber and fuel."
