    "intro": "Quercus obovalifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against pests and diseases. Quercus obovalifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and forest edges."
