It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
