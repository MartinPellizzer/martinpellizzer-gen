    "intro": "Quesnelia cayennensis, commonly known as the Cayenne quillwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Marsileaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, whorled leaves that resemble the bristles of a quill, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by tiny, floating fruits. Quesnelia cayennensis is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, muddy substrates and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
