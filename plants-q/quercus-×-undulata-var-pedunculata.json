    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 undulata var. pedunculata, commonly known as the pedunculate oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus petraea. It is characterized by its moderate to large size, with a rounded crown and sturdy, spreading branches. The leaves are typically lobed, with a serrated margin, and can vary in shape depending on the parent species. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are usually enclosed in a shallow cupule. This species is native to Europe and is often found in mixed forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
