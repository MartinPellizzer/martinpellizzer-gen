    "intro": "Quercus vallonea, commonly known as the Vallonea oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sicily. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments. The tree features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Quercus vallonea is characterized by its rugged appearance and is often found in scrublands and maquis vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
