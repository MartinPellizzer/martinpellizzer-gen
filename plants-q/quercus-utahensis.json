    "intro": "Quercus utahensis, commonly known as the Utah oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and drought."
