    "intro": "Quercus racemosa, commonly known as the flowering oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its distinctive clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and they turn red or brown in the fall. The tree produces small, inedible acorns that are usually enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
