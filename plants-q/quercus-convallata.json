    "intro": "Quercus convallata, commonly known as the creeping wood oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy green on top and paler underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, inedible acorns. Quercus convallata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
