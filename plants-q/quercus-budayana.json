    "intro": "Quercus budayana, commonly known as the Buday\u00e1n oak, is a rare and little-known species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir Mountains. The plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
