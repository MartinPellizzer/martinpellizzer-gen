    "intro": "Quercus tinctoria var. angulosa, commonly known as the angular persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape, with serrated margins and a distinctive angular appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange to red fruits that are edible but often\u6da9 (astringent) when unripe. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural research. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
