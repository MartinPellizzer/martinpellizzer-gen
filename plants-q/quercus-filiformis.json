    "intro": "Quercus filiformis, commonly known as the slenderleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Quercus filiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
