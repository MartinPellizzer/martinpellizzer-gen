It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (chestnut oak) and Quercus cerris (Turkey oak), exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree has lobed leaves that are often crisped at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inedible acorns that are typically dispersed by animals. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in urban landscapes for its aesthetic appeal."
