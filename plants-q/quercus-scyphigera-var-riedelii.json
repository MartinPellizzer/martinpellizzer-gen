    "intro": "Quercus scyphigera var. riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's oak, is a rare and unique variant of the scyphigera oak. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring broad, lobed leaves with a serrated margin. The plant is native to specific regions in Central Europe, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its acorns are small and often have a smooth surface, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
