    "intro": "Quercus lineata var. hildebrandii, commonly known as the Hildebrandii chinquapin oak, is a rare and relict species native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its acorns and broad, lobed leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in upland forests, often in association with other hardwoods. Its small, edible acorns are an important food source for wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species with conservation concerns."
