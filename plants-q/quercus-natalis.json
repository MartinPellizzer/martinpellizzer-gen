    "intro": "Quercus natalis, commonly known as the Natal oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, pale green acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in open woodlands and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors."
