    "intro": "Quercus devia, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against pests and diseases. Quercus devia typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
