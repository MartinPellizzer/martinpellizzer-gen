    "intro": "Quamoclit hederifolia, commonly known as the ivy-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady garden settings. Quamoclit hederifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
