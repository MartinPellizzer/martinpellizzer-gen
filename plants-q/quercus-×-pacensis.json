    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pacensis, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus lobata and Quercus polymorpha. It is native to central Mexico and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The Mexican white oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in local crafts and construction."
