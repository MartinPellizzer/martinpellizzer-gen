    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 neopalmeri, commonly known as the desert live oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the coast live oak (Quercus coyotei) and the interior live oak (Quercus wislizenii). It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and California, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This resilient tree is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native range."
