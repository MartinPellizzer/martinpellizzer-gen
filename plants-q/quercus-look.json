    "intro": "Quercus look, commonly known as the oak tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the beech family, Fagaceae. These trees are characterized by their sturdy, often branched trunks and broad, lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on the species. The leaves are typically deciduous, turning yellow or brown in the fall before dropping. Oak trees produce acorns, which are encased in a cupule and serve as a food source for various wildlife. They are widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere and are known for their longevity and ecological importance."
