    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 mahonii, commonly known as the chestnut oak, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural cross between Quercus prinus (southern red oak) and Quercus macrocarpa (bur oak), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, spreading crown with lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are edible and are often consumed by wildlife, contributing to its ecological importance. The chestnut oak is adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly found in mixed hardwood forests."
