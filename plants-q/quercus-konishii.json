    "intro": "Quercus konishii, commonly known as the Konishii oak, is a rare evergreen oak native to Japan. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
