    "intro": "Quercus polycarpa subf. latilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed polycarpa oak, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the polycarpa oak. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically larger and more rounded compared to other members of the species. The plant is native to specific regions in the southwestern United States, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
