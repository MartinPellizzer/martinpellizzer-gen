    "intro": "Quercus rubra f. obovata, commonly known as the red oak var. obovata, is a variant of the northern red oak characterized by its distinctive obovate leaf shape. The leaves are typically larger and broader than those of the standard red oak, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This form is often found in specific ecological niches, such as moist, well-drained soils in eastern North America. It shares the same overall growth habit as the parent species, featuring a broad, spreading crown and a sturdy, upright trunk. The acorns produced by this form are similar to those of the typical red oak, providing a valuable food source for wildlife."
