    "intro": "Queria dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous quillwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Podostomata. It is characterized by its branching, thread-like stems that emerge from the substrate in freshwater environments. The plant has tiny, scale-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged. It is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing the riverbed. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality."
