    "intro": "Quercus elongata, commonly known as the elongated oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and elongated acorns that are typically 2 to 3 centimeters long. The leaves are elliptical, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn reddish-brown in the fall. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
