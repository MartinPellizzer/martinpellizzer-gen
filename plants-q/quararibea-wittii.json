    "intro": "Quararibea wittii, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, peeling bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. Quararibea wittii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
