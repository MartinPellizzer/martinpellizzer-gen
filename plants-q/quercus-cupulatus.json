    "intro": "Quercus cupulatus, commonly known as the sweet chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, cup-like structures that enclose its edible nuts. Its nuts are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus cupulatus is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in furniture and flooring."
