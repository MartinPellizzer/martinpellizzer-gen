    "intro": "Quercus sierramadrensis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak woodlands at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
