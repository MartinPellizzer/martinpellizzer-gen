    "intro": "Quercus purulhana, commonly known as the Purulha oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests. The wood of Quercus purulhana is durable and has been used traditionally for construction and crafts in its native regions."
