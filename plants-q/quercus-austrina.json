    "intro": "Quercus austrina, commonly known as the Australian black oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Quercus austrina is valued for its ecological role and is also used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
