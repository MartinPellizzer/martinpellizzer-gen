    "intro": "Quercus castaneifolia, commonly known as the Persian chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of the chestnut tree, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a dense, rounded crown. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. Quercus castaneifolia is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed forests and along riverbanks."
