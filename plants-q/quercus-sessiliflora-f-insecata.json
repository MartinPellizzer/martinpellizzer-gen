    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora f. insecata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a variant of the white oak species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. This plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils within forested habitats. Its leaves are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the typical form, with a smooth margin and a deep lobing pattern. The acorns produced by this form are small and have a short stalk, contributing to its ecological role as a food source for various wildlife species. It is often found in association with other oak species in mixed hardwood forests."
