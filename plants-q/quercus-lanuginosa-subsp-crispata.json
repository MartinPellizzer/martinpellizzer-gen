    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa subsp. crispata, commonly known as the woolly oak or the crinkled oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that have a distinctive crinkled or wavy texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two or three. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
