    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 subalbescens, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus alba (white oak) and Quercus prinus (eastern pin oak). It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows as a medium-sized tree with a broad, spreading crown. Botanically, it exhibits traits of both parent species, making it an interesting subject for study in hybridization and ecological adaptation."
