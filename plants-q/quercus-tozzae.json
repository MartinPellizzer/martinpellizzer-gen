    "intro": "Quercus tozzae, commonly known as the Tozza's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, leathery leaves that are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes other oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. Quercus tozzae typically grows in dense stands on rocky slopes, where it forms a critical part of the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
