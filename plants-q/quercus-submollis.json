    "intro": "Quercus submollis, commonly known as the southern red oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its deep lobes on the leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 in number, and its acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive acorns. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The bark of Quercus submollis is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance as the tree matures."
