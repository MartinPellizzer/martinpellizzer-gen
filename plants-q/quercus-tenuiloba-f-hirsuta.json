    "intro": "Quercus tenuiloba f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hirsute chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive variant of the chinquapin oak. It is characterized by its dense, hirsute (hairy) foliage, which gives it a unique appearance compared to other members of the Quercus genus. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a rough texture, with a prominent midrib. This form is native to specific regions of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
