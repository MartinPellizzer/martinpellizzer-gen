    "intro": "Quercus alba f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the white oak with pinnately lobed leaves, is a variant of the white oak native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive pinnately lobed leaves, which differ from the typical serrated lobes of the standard white oak. The plant is a deciduous tree that produces small, dense clusters of acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves turn a striking yellow or bronze in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape. This form is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests."
