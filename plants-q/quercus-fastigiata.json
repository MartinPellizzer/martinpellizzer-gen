    "intro": "Quercus fastigiata, commonly known as the Italian white oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and elongated, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. Quercus fastigiata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
