    "intro": "Quercus tinctoria var. pseudoxalapensis, commonly known as the red oak or red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown stems that peel to reveal a smooth, light-colored inner bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by small, edible acorns that are typically consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and lobed, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
