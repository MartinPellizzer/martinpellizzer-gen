    "intro": "Quercus petraea subf. acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-toothed rock oak, is a subspecies of the pedunculate oak native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its serrated, acutely pointed leaves that are typically dark green on top and paler underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature typical of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
