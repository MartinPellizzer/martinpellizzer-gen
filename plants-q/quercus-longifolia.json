    "intro": "Quercus longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically 8\u201315 cm in length. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and pine forests. The longleaf oak is also notable for its slow growth and longevity, with some individuals living over 200 years."
