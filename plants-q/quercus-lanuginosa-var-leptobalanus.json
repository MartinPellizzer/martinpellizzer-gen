It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides of leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and nourishment for various species of birds and mammals."
