    "intro": "Quercus grosseserrata f. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf oak, is a variant of the broad-leaved oak native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves with prominent, wavy margins. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. Its acorns are small and typically have a shallow cupule, which is a distinguishing feature. This form is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its adaptation to fire-prone environments."
