    "intro": "Quercus annenkowii, commonly known as the Annenkow's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorns and leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at high elevations, where it forms dense, evergreen forests. Its botanical features include a stout trunk, rough bark, and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus annenkowii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
