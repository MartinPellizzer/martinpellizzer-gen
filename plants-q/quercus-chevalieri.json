    "intro": "Quercus chevalieri, commonly known as the Corsican oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they turn yellow in the autumn. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that partially encloses the nut, and it produces them in the fall. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays a significant role in the local ecosystem."
