    "intro": "Quercus mohriana, commonly known as the Mohri's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus mohriana is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
