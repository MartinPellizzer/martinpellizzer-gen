It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Quercus baetica is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
