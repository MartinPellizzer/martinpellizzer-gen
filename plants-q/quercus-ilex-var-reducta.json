    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. reducta, commonly known as the Spanish stone oak, is a variant of the evergreen holm oak. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more oval in shape compared to the standard Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variety is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
