    "intro": "Quercus transmontana var. obscura, commonly known as the darkleaf chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn a striking red or brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests. The bark is generally smooth when young but becomes furrowed and flaky with age."
