    "intro": "Qualea lancifolia, commonly known as the pink river dolphin plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it to the riverbed while absorbing nutrients from the water. Qualea lancifolia plays a vital role in the aquatic ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
