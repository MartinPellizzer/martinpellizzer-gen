It is characterized by its smooth, often grey or brown bark and its distinctive, silvery-white undersides on the leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a soft, fuzzy texture. It produces small, red or yellowish flowers in spring, followed by acorn-like fruits. This species is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
