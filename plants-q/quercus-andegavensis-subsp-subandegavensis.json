    "intro": "Quercus andegavensis subsp. subandegavensis, commonly known as the Andegavensis oak, is a subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves. The bark is typically smooth and grayish in appearance, with a tendency to flake as the tree matures. This subspecies thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of study in ecological and taxonomic research."
