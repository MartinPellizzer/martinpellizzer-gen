    "intro": "Quercus gracilenta, commonly known as the slenderleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish in youth, becoming fissured with age. Quercus gracilenta is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
