    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hopeiensis, commonly known as the Hope's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus sessilifolia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The Hope's oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in botanical studies."
