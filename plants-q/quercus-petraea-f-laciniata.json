    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. laciniata, commonly known as the serrated rock oak, is a variant of the pedunculate oak characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins. This plant is native to Europe and thrives in rocky or limestone soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically smaller and more deeply lobed compared to the typical form, contributing to its unique appearance. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is a hardy, slow-growing tree that plays a significant role in forest ecosystems."
