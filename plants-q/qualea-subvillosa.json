    "intro": "Qualea subvillosa, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silky hair that helps reduce water loss and provides a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Qualea subvillosa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water filtration."
