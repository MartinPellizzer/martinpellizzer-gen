    "intro": "Quercus kontumensis, commonly known as Kontum oak, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within montane forest ecosystems. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quercus kontumensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
