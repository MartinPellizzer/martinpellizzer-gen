It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes."
