    "intro": "Quercus virens var. maritima, commonly known as the maritime live oak, is a variant of the live oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically glossy and elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are either male or female, and it relies on wind pollination. Its acorns are edible and are often consumed by wildlife. This variety is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
