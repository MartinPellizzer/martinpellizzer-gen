    "intro": "Quararibea soegengii, commonly known as the Soegeng's soursop, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The tree produces large, spiny fruits that are similar in appearance to soursop but have a distinct flavor. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and has limited use in traditional medicine. Due to its restricted natural range, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
