    "intro": "Quinchamalium bracteosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf quinchamalium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Quinchamalium bracteosum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
