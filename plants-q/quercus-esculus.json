    "intro": "Quercus esculus, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its lobed leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 lobes, and its acorns, which are enclosed in a cupule. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its characteristic acorns. It is often found in rocky or dry soils and can grow to a height of up to 20 meters. The Persian oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
