    "intro": "Quercus macrocarpa, commonly known as the bur oak, is a large deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thick, deeply furrowed bark and large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, which gives it its common name. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. The bur oak is known for its longevity and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic value."
