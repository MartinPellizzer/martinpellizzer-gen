    "intro": "Quercus dehangensis, commonly known as the Dehang oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are lobed, with a serrated margin, and turn yellow in autumn before shedding. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that covers most of the nut, and are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus dehangensis is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
