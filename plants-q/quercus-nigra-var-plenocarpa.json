    "intro": "Quercus nigra var. plenocarpa, commonly known as the red\u680e or the black oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and lobed, alternate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a tendency to form dense canopies in mature forests. This variety is particularly noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
