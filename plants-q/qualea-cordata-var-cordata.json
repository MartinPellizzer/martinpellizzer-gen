    "intro": "Qualea cordata var. cordata, commonly known as the pink river turtlehead, is a species of flowering plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and the plant plays a role in the ecological balance of its native region. Qualea cordata var. cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
