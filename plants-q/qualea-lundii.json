    "intro": "Qualea lundii, commonly known as the Amazonian water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, which provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive cup-like shape that helps in pollination by insects. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with high humidity and abundant sunlight. Qualea lundii plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
