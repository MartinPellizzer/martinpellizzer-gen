    "intro": "Quercus versicolor, commonly known as the variable oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf coloration, which can range from yellow to red or brown depending on environmental conditions. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically harvested by wildlife such as squirrels and birds. Its leaves are usually lobed and can vary in shape and size across different individuals. Quercus versicolor is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
