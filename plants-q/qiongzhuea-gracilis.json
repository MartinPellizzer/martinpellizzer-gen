    "intro": "Qiongzhuea gracilis, commonly known as the slender qiongzhuea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, small elliptical leaves, and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Qiongzhuea gracilis is considered a vulnerable species."
