It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing structural support and protection. Quercus gonoloba is known for its longevity, with some specimens living over 200 years."
