    "intro": "Quercus woronowii, commonly known as the Russian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
