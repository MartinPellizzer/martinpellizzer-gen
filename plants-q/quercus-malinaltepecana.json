    "intro": "Quercus malinaltepecana, commonly known as the Malinaltepec oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family Fagaceae. It is native to central Mexico, specifically the states of Hidalgo, Puebla, and Tlaxcala. This evergreen oak typically grows in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The tree is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves and produces small, edible acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support in its mountainous habitat."
