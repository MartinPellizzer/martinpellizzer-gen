    "intro": "Quinetia urvillei, commonly known as the Urville's quinetia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity and partial light. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quinetia urvillei is considered a species of conservation concern."
