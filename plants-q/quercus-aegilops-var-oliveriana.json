    "intro": "Quercus aegilops var. oliveriana, commonly known as the Oliver's oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Quercus genus. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and distinctive leaf morphology, which often features a lobed or serrated margin. This plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showing a preference for well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential ecological role in specific microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation interest."
