    "intro": "Quercus glauca f. nudata, commonly known as the Chinese white oak or the glabrous chinquapin, is a rare and unique variant of the Chinese white oak. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless bark and smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical species. This form is native to China and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
