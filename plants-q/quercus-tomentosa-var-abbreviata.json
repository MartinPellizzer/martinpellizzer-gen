    "intro": "Quercus tomentosa var. abbreviata, commonly known as the southern live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling canopy and thick, leathery leaves that are typically grayish-white underneath. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is partially covered by the base of the acorn itself. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal plain regions. The botanical features of this variety make it well adapted to humid, subtropical climates."
