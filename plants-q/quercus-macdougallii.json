    "intro": "Quercus macdougallii, commonly known as the Texas live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and thick, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. The Texas live oak is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
