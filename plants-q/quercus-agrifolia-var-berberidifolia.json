    "intro": "Quercus agrifolia var. berberidifolia, commonly known as the California coffeeberry, is a shrub or small tree native to California. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble the leaves of the barberry plant. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in coastal and inland regions with well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This variant is often found in chaparral and woodlands, contributing to local biodiversity."
