    "intro": "Quercus augustinei var. rockiana, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain chinquapin, is a rare and relict species native to the high elevations of the southwestern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with dark green, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically clustered in groups of two to three. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to harsh, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
