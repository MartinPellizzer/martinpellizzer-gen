    "intro": "Quercus uchiyamana, commonly known as the Uchiyamana oak, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional Japanese landscapes."
