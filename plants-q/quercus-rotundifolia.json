    "intro": "Quercus rotundifolia, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a species of oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
