It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a broad, rounded shape with a serrated margin. The plant exhibits a moderate growth rate and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its acorns are typically smaller than those of the typical species and have a distinctive shape. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance."
