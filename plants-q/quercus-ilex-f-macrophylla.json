    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved holm oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Its acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule, and it produces them in the fall. The leaves are evergreen in warmer climates but may shed in colder regions, making it adaptable to a range of Mediterranean environments."
