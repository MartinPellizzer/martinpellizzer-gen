It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged texture. Quercus caudata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
