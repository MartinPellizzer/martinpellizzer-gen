    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 megaleia, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus polymorpha and Quercus crassifolia. It is native to the central and southern regions of Mexico, where it thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are usually broad-ovate with rounded tips and are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, dark brown acorns that are an important food source for wildlife."
