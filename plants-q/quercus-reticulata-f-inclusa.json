It is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and landscape gardening."
