It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in a variety of soil types, including clay and loam. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy and thick, fissured bark. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and often have a whitish underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife and are also used in traditional practices by indigenous communities."
