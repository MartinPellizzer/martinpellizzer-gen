It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically retained on the tree for several years before falling. Quercus yousei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
