    "intro": "Quercus lucida, commonly known as the flameleaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, red flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, chestnut-like fruits. Its bark is gray and becomes scaly with age, and it typically grows to a height of 30 to 50 feet. Quercus lucida is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
