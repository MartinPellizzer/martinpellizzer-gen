    "intro": "Quercus alpestris var. ellipticifolia, commonly known as the Alpine oak or elliptic-leaf oak, is a subspecies of the common oak native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Its acorns are small and often used by wildlife, contributing to its ecological importance. This variant is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
