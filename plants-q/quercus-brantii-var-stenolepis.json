    "intro": "Quercus brantii var. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a smooth, glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native range."
