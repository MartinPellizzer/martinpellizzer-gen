    "intro": "Quercus subocculta, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and has a moderate growth rate, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
