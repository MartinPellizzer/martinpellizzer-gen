    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 macnabiana, commonly known as the Macnab oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryana and Quercus petraea. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its oval to elliptical leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often encased in a cupule, a unique feature of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The botanical interest of Quercus \u00d7 macnabiana lies in its hybrid origin and its role in ecological and horticultural contexts."
