    "intro": "Quercus tephrochlamys, commonly known as the ash-leaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical with a distinctive ash-gray underside. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
