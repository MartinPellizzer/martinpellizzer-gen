    "intro": "Quercus suber f. brevisquama, commonly known as the Algerian cork oak, is a rare variant of the cork oak native to the Maghreb region of North Africa. It is characterized by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to the typical cork oak, which is an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically dispersed by animals. Its bark, while not as thick as that of the common cork oak, still contains a layer of suberized tissue. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological significance in its native habitat."
