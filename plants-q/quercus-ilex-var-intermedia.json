    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. intermedia, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and more elliptical compared to the standard Quercus ilex. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are a valuable food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. This variant is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions."
