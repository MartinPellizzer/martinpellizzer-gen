    "intro": "Quivisia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved quivisia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, where leaves grow in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
