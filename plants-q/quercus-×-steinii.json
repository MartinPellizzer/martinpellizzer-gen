    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 steinii, commonly known as the Stein's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus lobata (scrub oak) and Quercus berberidifolia (berberi oak). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to California, characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule with bristly hairs. Quercus \u00d7 steinii thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
