    "intro": "Quercus nigra var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf blackjack oak, is a small, low-growing deciduous shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches a height of only 3 to 6 feet, with a rounded or spreading form. The plant features dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall, and it produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its compact size and ornamental value make it suitable for use in small gardens or as a landscape specimen. The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
