    "intro": "Quercus leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus leptocarpa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
