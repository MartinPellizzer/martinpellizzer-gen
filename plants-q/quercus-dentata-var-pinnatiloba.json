    "intro": "Quercus dentata var. pinnatiloba, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree, is a variant of the Chinese chestnut oak. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in drooping clusters, followed by small, edible acorns. It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in temperate climates. This plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
