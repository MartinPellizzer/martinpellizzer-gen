    "intro": "Quercus graciliramis, commonly known as the slender-rammed oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish in color, becoming more rugged with age. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus graciliramis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
