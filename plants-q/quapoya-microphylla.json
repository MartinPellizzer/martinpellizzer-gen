    "intro": "Quapoya microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved quapoya, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along creeklines and in understorey habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
