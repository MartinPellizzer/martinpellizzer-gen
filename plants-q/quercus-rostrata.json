    "intro": "Quercus rostrata, commonly known as the rostrata oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
