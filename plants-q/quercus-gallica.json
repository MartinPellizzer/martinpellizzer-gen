    "intro": "Quercus gallica, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus gallica typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a rounded crown with a dense, spreading habit. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions."
