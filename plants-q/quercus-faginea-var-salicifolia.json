    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. salicifolia, commonly known as the silky beech, is a deciduous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The leaves turn a striking yellow or reddish-brown in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It produces small, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny cupule. This species is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role."
