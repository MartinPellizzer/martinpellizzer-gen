    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 mccormickii, commonly known as the McCormick oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus borealis and Quercus ellipsoidalis. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It is often found in the northeastern United States, particularly in areas with a mix of forest and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
