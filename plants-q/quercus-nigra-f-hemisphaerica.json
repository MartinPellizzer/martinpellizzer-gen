This form exhibits a dense, spherical shape, which sets it apart from the typical spreading growth habit of the species. Botanically, it is a deciduous tree with dark, glossy leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its compact form makes it a valuable ornamental tree in horticulture and landscape design."
