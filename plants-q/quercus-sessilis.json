    "intro": "Quercus sessilis, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are attached directly to the stem, lacking a stalk. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Quercus sessilis is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological importance in supporting diverse wildlife."
