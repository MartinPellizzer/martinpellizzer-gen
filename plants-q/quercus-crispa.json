    "intro": "Quercus crispa, commonly known as the prickly oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, serrated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. Quercus crispa is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in harsh alpine conditions."
