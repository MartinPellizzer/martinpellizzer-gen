    "intro": "Quercus erioclada, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically hairless on the upper surface and hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus erioclada thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and chaparral habitats."
