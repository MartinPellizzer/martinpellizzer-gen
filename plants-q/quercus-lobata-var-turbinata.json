It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in riparian zones and valley bottoms, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The species is notable for its tall, straight trunk and can reach heights of up to 40 meters."
