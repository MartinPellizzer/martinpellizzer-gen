    "intro": "Quercus vinealis, commonly known as the creeping wood oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and dark green, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of red-brown acorns. Its acorns are typically enclosed in a cupule and are an important food source for wildlife. Quercus vinealis is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
