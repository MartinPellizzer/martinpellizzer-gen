It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects."
