    "intro": "Quassia excelsa, commonly known as the African quassia or quassia tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to central and western Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the rainy season. The tree produces long, slender fruits that contain hard, woody seeds. Its bark and leaves contain quassinoids, which are potent bitter compounds used in traditional medicine. Quassia excelsa is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
