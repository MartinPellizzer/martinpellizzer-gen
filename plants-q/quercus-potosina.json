    "intro": "Quercus potosina, commonly known as the Potosi oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that are typically covered in a dense, woolly coating. Quercus potosina thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
