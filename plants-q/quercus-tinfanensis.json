    "intro": "Quercus tinfanensis, commonly known as the Tinfan oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly covering. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. The plant has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
