It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and acorn-like fruits. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland to montane forests.
