    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. sulcata, commonly known as the woolly oak or sulcate oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically borne in clusters, and it flowers in the spring with inconspicuous, yellowish-green catkins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats."
