    "intro": "Quercus glaucescens, commonly known as the blue oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its short, thick branches and small, leathery leaves that often appear blue-green in color. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers. The blue oak is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
