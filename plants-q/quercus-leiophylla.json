    "intro": "Quercus leiophylla, commonly known as the smoothleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature typical of the oak genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Quercus leiophylla plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
