    "intro": "Qualea dichotoma var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated water lettuce, is a aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant has a spongy, white underside that aids in gas exchange. It reproduces through vegetative propagation, forming dense mats on the water surface. This species plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
