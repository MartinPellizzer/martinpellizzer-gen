    "intro": "Quercus conformis, commonly known as the Japanese evergreen oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a glossy appearance, often with a slightly wavy margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its compact size and aesthetic appeal."
