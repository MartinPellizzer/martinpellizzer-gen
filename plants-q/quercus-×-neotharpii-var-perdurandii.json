    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 neotharpii var. perdurandii, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut oak, is a hybrid species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. Botanically, it exhibits traits of both its parent species, Quercus glauca and Quercus dentata, with a combination of morphological features. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
