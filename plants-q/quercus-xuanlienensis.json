    "intro": "Quercus xuanlienensis, commonly known as Xuanlien oak, is a rare and endemic species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are typically lobed and have a serrated edge. It produces acorns, which are the fruit of the oak genus, and these are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus xuanlienensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
