    "intro": "Quercus sebifera, commonly known as the California chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces small, spiky capsules that contain edible, sweet, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and oak woodland habitats. Due to its historical importance and ecological role, it is a significant species in the region's flora."
