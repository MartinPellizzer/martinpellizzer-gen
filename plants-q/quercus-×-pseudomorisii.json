    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pseudomorisii, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree that exhibits characteristics of both Quercus prinus (chestnut oak) and Quercus morrisii (Morris oak). It typically grows in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree has broad, ovate leaves that are often lobed and turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and typically take one to two years to mature. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
