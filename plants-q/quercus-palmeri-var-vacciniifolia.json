    "intro": "Quercus palmeri var. vacciniifolia, commonly known as the redleaf palo verde, is a variant of the palo verde tree native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its distinctive red or maroon leaves, which are small, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped acorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
