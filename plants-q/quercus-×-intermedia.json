    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the English Oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (the pedunculate oak) and Quercus sessiliflora (the sessile oak). It is a deciduous tree native to western Europe, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and is valued for its durable wood and ornamental qualities."
