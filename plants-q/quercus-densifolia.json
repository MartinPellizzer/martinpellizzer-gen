    "intro": "Quercus densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and acorn-producing capsules, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and a leathery texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
