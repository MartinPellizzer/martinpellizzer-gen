It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
