    "intro": "Quercus marlipoensis, commonly known as the Marlipo oak, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
