    "intro": "Quercus stenophylla var. hypargyrea, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a variant of the stenophylla oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its overall compact, shrub-like growth habit. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a distinct silvery underside. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall. It is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
