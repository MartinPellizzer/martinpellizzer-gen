    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 anselmii, commonly known as the Anselm oak, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that mature over a period of several months. It is native to Europe and is often found in mixed forests and woodlands. Quercus \u00d7 anselmii is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
