    "intro": "Quercus brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruit oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The leaves are elliptical with a pointed tip and are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and mammals that rely on its acorns for food."
