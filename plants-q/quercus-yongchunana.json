    "intro": "Quercus yongchunana, commonly known as Yongchun oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
