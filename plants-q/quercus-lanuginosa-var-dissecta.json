    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. dissecta, commonly known as the silky oak or the dissected silky oak, is a variant of the silky oak tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its finely dissected leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and its bark is typically smooth and greyish in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by acorn-like nuts. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
