    "intro": "Quercus densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by small, acorn-like fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus densiflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
