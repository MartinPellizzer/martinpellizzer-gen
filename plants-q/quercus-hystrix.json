    "intro": "Quercus hystrix, commonly known as the holly oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and spiny acorns, which are a distinctive botanical feature. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to hot, arid climates. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a pointed tip and a rough texture, contributing to its unique appearance. The holly oak is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
