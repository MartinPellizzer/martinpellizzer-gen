    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 coutinhoi subsp. subalpestris, commonly known as the subalpine oak, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. This subspecies typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its bark is usually smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. The plant plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
