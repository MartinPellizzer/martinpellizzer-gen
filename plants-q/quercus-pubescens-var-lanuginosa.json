    "intro": "Quercus pubescens var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the soft-leaved oak, is a variant of the downy oak, characterized by its hairy, silvery-green foliage. It is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a dense covering of fine hairs. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense layer of fuzzy hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
