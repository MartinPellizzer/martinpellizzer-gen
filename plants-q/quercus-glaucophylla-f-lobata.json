    "intro": "Quercus glaucophylla f. lobata, commonly known as the lobed glaucophyll oak, is a variant of the glaucophyll oak native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves, which are typically broad and have a leathery texture. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and thrives in well-drained soils in woodland or forest habitats. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native range."
