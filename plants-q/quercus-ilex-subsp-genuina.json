    "intro": "Quercus ilex subsp. genuina, commonly known as the Gibraltar oak, is a subspecies of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and robust, sprawling growth habit. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate. This subspecies is notable for its longevity and resilience, often living over 500 years in its native habitat."
