    "intro": "Quesnelia centralis, commonly known as the Central Brazil pine, is a species of conifer native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen trunk and dense, needle-like leaves that form a compact crown. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. Quesnelia centralis is adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in conservation areas."
