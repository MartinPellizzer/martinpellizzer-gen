    "intro": "Quercus pfaeffingeri, commonly known as the Pfaeffinger oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. This evergreen oak is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
