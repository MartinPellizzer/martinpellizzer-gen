    "intro": "Quercus kingiana, commonly known as the California black oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and acorn-producing capsules that are typically enclosed in cupules. The leaves are generally elliptical with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn reddish-brown in the fall. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
