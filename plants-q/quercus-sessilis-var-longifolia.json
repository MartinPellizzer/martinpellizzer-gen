    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often longer than they are wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Its acorns are small and have a short stalk, and the tree can reach heights of up to 20 meters. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in timber production."
