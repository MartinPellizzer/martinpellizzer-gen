    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fontanesii, commonly known as the Spanish white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus faginea and Quercus serrata. It is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by its white to pale gray bark and alternate, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
