    "intro": "Quercus chapmanii, commonly known as Chapman's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woolly cap. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodlands. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
