    "intro": "Quercus longiaristata, commonly known as the long-leaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The bark of Quercus longiaristata is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps protect it from environmental stress."
