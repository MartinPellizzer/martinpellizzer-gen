    "intro": "Quercus obscura var. perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a rare and small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to plant enthusiasts and conservationists."
