    "intro": "Quesnelia imbricata, commonly known as the Brazilian pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, spiny leaves that form a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Quesnelia imbricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
