    "intro": "Quararibea dolichopoda, commonly known as the long-stemmed balsa, is a small evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries containing small, dark seeds. It is valued for its lightweight wood, which has been traditionally used in model building and as a material for insulation. The species is also of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local biodiversity."
