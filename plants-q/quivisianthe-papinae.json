    "intro": "Quivisianthe papinae, commonly known as the Papinean quivisianthe, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds covered in a silky, fibrous coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
