    "intro": "Quercus tremens, commonly known as the shivering oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, acorn-like fruits. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The tree is known for its distinctive trembling motion in the wind, which gives it its common name."
