    "intro": "Quercus pallescens, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The tree has a broad, spreading crown and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are elliptical with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall. Quercus pallescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates."
