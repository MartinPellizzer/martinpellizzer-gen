    "intro": "Quercus coccinata, commonly known as the Florida chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, cup-like fruits that contain one or two edible nuts. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in swamps and along stream banks. The Florida chinquapin is valued for its ecological role in providing food and shelter for wildlife."
