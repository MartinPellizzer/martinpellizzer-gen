    "intro": "Quercus ilex subsp. montserratensis, commonly known as the Montserrat holly oak, is a subspecies of the evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
