    "intro": "Quercus duratifolia, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. This tree is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and can grow up to 15 meters in height. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Quercus duratifolia produces small, urn-shaped flowers and is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
