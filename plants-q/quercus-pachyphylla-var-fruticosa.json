    "intro": "Quercus pachyphylla var. fruticosa, commonly known as the thick-leaved oak or shrub oak, is a variant of the thick-leaved oak species native to the southwestern United States. This plant is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. The leaves are typically dark green and may have a bluish-gray appearance due to a dense layer of trichomes. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
