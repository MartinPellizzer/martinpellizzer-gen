    "intro": "Quercus suber f. microcarpa, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or cork oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, corky bark, which is highly valued for its insulating properties. The leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a serrated margin. This subspecies thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
