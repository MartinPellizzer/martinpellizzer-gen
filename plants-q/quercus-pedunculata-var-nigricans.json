    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. nigricans, commonly known as the black-leaf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that turn reddish in autumn, and its small, spiny fruit capsules that contain one or two seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats, such as chaparral and woodland areas. It has a compact growth habit with multiple stems and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
