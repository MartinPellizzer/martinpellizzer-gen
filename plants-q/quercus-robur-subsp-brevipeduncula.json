    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. brevipeduncula, commonly known as the short-stalked pedunculate oak, is a subspecies of the common oak characterized by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical form. It is a deciduous tree native to central and eastern Europe, often found in mixed forests and along river valleys. The leaves are lobed, typically with 5\u20137 lobes, and are dark green on the upper surface with a lighter underside. Its acorns are encased in a cupule that is partially covered by the involucre, and the tree produces flowers in the spring. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and historical significance in European forestry."
