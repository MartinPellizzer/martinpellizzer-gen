    "intro": "Quercus dumosa f. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf scrub oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, oval leaves that have a leathery texture and a distinctive myrtle-like scent. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorn-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
