    "intro": "Quercus velutina f. obovata, commonly known as the southern red oak, is a variant of the red oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its obovate leaf shape, which is broader at the tip and tapers toward the base. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a velvety texture on the underside. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, and it thrives in well-drained soils in woodland habitats. It is an important component of the forest ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
