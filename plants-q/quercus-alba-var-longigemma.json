    "intro": "Quercus alba var. longigemma, commonly known as the long-leaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, pointed leaves that are typically 6 to 12 inches long. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin. This variety exhibits a slower growth rate compared to other white oak species, often reaching heights of 50 to 70 feet. Its acorns are small, with a cap that covers about one-third of the nut, and they mature in the second year."
