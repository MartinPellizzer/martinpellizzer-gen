It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence composed of a spadix and a spathe. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and yellow. Quirina thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
