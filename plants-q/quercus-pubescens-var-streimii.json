    "intro": "Quercus pubescens var. streimii, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and leaves that are elliptical with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are edible for wildlife and some livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. This variety is notable for its ecological importance and historical use in traditional medicine."
