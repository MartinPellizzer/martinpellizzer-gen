    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved oak, is a shrub-like species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in cupules. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions typical of its native habitat."
