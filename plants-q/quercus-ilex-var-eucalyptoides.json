    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. eucalyptoides, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically smaller and more elliptical than those of the standard Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in horticulture."
