    "intro": "Quercus tenuicola, commonly known as the slenderleaf oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Quercus tenuicola is adapted to dry climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
