    "intro": "Quercus wislizeni f. extima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved canyon oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the canyon oak species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often twisted or rolled, giving it a unique appearance. This plant is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
