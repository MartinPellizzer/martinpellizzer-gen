    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 ilicococcinea, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus ilicifolia and Quercus coccinea. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are usually grayish-white underneath, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is found in the southeastern United States. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. The silverleaf oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
