    "intro": "Quercus incarnata, commonly known as the swamp chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically glossy on the upper surface and hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that mature in the fall. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus incarnata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
