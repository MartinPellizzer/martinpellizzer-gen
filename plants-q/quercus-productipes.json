    "intro": "Quercus productipes, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible acorns that are encased in a thick, sticky hull. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats. The Pacific madrone is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
