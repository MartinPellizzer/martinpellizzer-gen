    "intro": "Quercus rotundifolia var. avellaniformis, commonly known as the rounded-leaf oak or the sweet chestnut oak, is a variant of the red oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical or rounded leaves that are often glossy and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically found in clusters, and its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with ample sunlight. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
