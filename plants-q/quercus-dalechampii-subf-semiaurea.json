    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii subf. semiaurea, commonly known as the golden-leafed sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant has a rounded, broad crown and produces small, acorn-like fruits. Its leaves are typically shorter and more oval-shaped compared to the typical sessile oak. This sub-species is often found in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in temperate climates."
