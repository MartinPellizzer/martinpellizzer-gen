    "intro": "Quercus arkansana, commonly known as the water oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing structural support and protection. Water oak thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in floodplain forests."
