    "intro": "Quekettia micromera var. major, commonly known as the small-flowered quekettia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Australia. It is characterized by its diminutive, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
