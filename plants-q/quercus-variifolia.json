    "intro": "Quercus variifolia, commonly known as the variable oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which ranges from elliptical to ovate, often with serrated margins. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, and they turn yellow or brown in the fall. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, scaly cap. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and ecological benefits."
