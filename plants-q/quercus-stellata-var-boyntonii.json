    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. boyntonii, commonly known as the Boynton's chinquapin, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, elliptic leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by hard, spiny capsules that contain its edible, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats, making it an important component of native plant communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
