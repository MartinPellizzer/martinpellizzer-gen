    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. macrophylla, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen leaves that are broader and more elongated compared to the typical holm oak. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that mature over a year, and its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and scrubland environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in Mediterranean ecosystems."
