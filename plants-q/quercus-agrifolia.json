    "intro": "Quercus agrifolia, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to California. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are lobed and often have a waxy coating. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in coastal areas and can thrive in a range of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The coast live oak is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, with drought tolerance and resistance to many pests and diseases."
