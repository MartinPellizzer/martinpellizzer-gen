    "intro": "Quercus arenaria, commonly known as the sand live oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in cupules, which are hairy and persistent. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Quercus arenaria plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
