    "intro": "Quercus substenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-cupped oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, which is narrower than in many other oak species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The botanical features of Quercus substenocarpa make it an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits."
