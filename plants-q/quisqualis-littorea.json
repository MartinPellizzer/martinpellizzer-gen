    "intro": "Quisqualis littorea, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to pink and yellow. The plant has thick, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Quisqualis littorea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
