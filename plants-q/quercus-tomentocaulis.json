    "intro": "Quercus tomentocaulis, commonly known as the bear oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray bark and small, oval-shaped leaves with a fuzzy underside. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The bear oak plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
