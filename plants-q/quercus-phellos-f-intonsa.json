    "intro": "Quercus phellos f. intonsa, commonly known as the laceleaf live oak, is a unique variant of the live oak characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves. This form exhibits a more delicate and intricate leaf structure compared to the typical live oak, with a lighter green color and a more pronounced veining pattern. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
