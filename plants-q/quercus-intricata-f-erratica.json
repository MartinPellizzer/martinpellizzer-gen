    "intro": "Quercus intricata f. erratica, commonly known as the wandering oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the intricate oak. It is characterized by its highly branched, sprawling growth habit and twisted, gnarled branches that give it a unique, almost sculptural appearance. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a glossy upper surface. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
