    "intro": "Queria hispanica var. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered quillwort, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces compact clusters of spore-bearing structures called sporocarps, which are often found at the base of the stems. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
