It typically grows to a height of 30 to 50 feet and has a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are lobed, with a rough, sandpapery texture on the upper surface. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
