    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. insecata, commonly known as the rock oak, is a rare variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring deeply lobed leaves with a narrow, elongated shape. This form typically grows in rocky or steep terrain, where it adapts to poor soil conditions and limited space. Its leaves are usually smaller and more rigid compared to the typical sessile oak, which aids in reducing water loss. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe."
