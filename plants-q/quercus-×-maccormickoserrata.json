    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 maccormickoserrata, commonly known as the Maccormick's holly oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus ilex and Quercus coccifera. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in coastal and dry environments."
