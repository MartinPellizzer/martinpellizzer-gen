    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 ermolenkoi, commonly known as the Ermolenko oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus petraea. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
