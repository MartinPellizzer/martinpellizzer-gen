    "intro": "Quercus rubra f. cuneata, commonly known as the cuneata form of the red oak, is a naturally occurring variant characterized by its distinctive leaf shape. The leaves are typically narrower and more elongated compared to typical red oak leaves, with a cuneate base. This form is often found in specific geographic regions where environmental conditions favor its growth. It shares the same ecological preferences as the parent species, including well-drained soils and full sun. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology."
