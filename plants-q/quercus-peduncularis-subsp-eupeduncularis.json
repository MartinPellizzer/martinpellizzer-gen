It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in drooping clusters, followed by edible, spiny fruits called chestnuts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible nuts. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Quercus genus and is valued for its ecological and agricultural importance."
