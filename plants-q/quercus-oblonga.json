    "intro": "Quercus oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that mature over a period of several months. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, providing a rugged texture. Quercus oblonga is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
