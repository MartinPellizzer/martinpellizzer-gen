It is characterized by its small, rounded acorns enclosed in a short cupule. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. This form is notable for its compact growth habit and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
