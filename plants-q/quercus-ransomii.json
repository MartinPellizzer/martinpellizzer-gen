    "intro": "Quercus ransomii, commonly known as Ransom's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and paler underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woolly cap, which provides protection for the developing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus ransomii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
