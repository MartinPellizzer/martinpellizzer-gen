    "intro": "Quercus prainiana, commonly known as the Prain's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
