    "intro": "Quercus szovitsii, commonly known as the Szovits oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Carpathian Basin in Central Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and elliptical leaves with a serrated margin. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
