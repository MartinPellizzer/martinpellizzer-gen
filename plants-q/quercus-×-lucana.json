    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 lucana, commonly known as the Spanish white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is characterized by its white, smooth bark and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The tree has a broad, rounded crown and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in furniture-making and construction. The plant exhibits typical characteristics of the Fagaceae family, including alternate, serrated leaves and the production of acorns."
