    "intro": "Quercus todaroi, commonly known as the Todaroi oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. It thrives in the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. The Todaroi oak is notable for its ecological significance and is considered a relict species with a distinct evolutionary history."
