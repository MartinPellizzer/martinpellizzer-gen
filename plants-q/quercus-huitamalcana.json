    "intro": "Quercus huitamalcana, commonly known as the Huitamalcan oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
