    "intro": "Quercus bourgaei, commonly known as the Bornean chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its production of acorns. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a broad, rounded crown and dark green, glossy leaves. Its acorns are enclosed in a cupule and are an important food source for various wildlife species. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems."
