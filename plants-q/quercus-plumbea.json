    "intro": "Quercus plumbea, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its elliptical leaves that are often lobed. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Quercus plumbea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
