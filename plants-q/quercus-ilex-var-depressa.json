    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. depressa, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a shrub-like variant of the holm oak. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the standard species. This plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France, where it thrives in Mediterranean climates. It produces small, inedible acorns and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
