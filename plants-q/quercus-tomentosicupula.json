    "intro": "Quercus tomentosicupula, commonly known as the silky cupular oak, is a species of oak characterized by its unique botanical features. It is a small to medium-sized tree with a rounded crown and thick, silvery-gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a soft, downy underside that gives the plant its common name. The acorns are small, with a scaly cap and are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. This species is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
