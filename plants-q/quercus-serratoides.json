    "intro": "Quercus serratoides, commonly known as the serrated oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lobed leaves, which have a distinctive serrated edge, and its acorns, which are typically small and covered in a dense, hairy cap. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Quercus serratoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes planted in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
