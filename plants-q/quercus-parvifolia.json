    "intro": "Quercus parvifolia, commonly known as the Chinese dwarf oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with moderate to high humidity. Quercus parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
