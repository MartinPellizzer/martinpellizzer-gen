    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. pyramidalis-cucullata, commonly known as the pyramidal Chinese chestnut, is a variant of the Chinese chestnut tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its conical or pyramidal shape, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are typically harvested in the autumn. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is valued for both its ecological benefits and its potential for cultivation in suitable climates."
