    "intro": "Quercus rhodophlebia f. inclusa, commonly known as the red-leafed oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the red oak species. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which sets it apart from other members of the Quercus genus. The plant is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in temperate forest environments. Its leaves are typically smaller and more densely packed compared to the standard species, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
