    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. brachycalyx, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or brachycalyx oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, which is shorter and more compact compared to other oak species. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions."
