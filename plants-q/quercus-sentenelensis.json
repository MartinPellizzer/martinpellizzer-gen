    "intro": "Quercus sentenelensis, commonly known as the Sentinel Oak, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall, often growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
