    "intro": "Quercus dacica, commonly known as the Carpathian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn yellow or brown in the autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus dacica typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. It is well adapted to mountainous environments and is often found in mixed forests with other hardwood species."
