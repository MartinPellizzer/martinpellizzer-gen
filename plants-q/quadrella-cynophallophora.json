    "intro": "Quadrella cynophallophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a semi-epiphytic species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of eucalyptus trees. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful conservation efforts."
