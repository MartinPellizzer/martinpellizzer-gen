    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. eubroteroi, commonly known as the Eubroteroi hornbeam, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its dark, fissured bark and small, acorn-like fruits. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a rough, hairy underside. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
