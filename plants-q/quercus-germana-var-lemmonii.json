    "intro": "Quercus germana var. lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's German oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the southwestern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
