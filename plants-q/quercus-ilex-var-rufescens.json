    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. rufescens, commonly known as the rough-leaved holm oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green to reddish-brown on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature of the oak genus. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional uses in local communities."
