    "intro": "Quetzalia contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf quetzal, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
