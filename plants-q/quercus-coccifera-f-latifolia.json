    "intro": "Quercus coccifera f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Quercus coccifera. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its small, acorn-like fruits are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional landscaping."
