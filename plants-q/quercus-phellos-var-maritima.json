    "intro": "Quercus phellos var. maritima, commonly known as the maritime scrub oak, is a variant of the willow oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with narrow, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant has a dense, shrub-like growth habit and is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This variety is often found in maritime dune ecosystems, where it plays a key role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
