    "intro": "Quercus glauca var. nudata, commonly known as the Chinese white oak or smoothleaf white oak, is a variant of the Chinese white oak native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and elliptical leaves that are typically hairless on both surfaces. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish acorns that are enclosed in cupules with short, bristly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with moderate to high humidity. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
