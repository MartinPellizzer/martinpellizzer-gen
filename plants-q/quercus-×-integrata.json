    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 integrata, commonly known as the Coast Live Oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a distinctive lobed shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark brown acorns that mature over the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The Coast Live Oak is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to provide shade in coastal environments."
