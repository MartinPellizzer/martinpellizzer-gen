    "intro": "Quercus calliprinos var. brachybalanos, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the western United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
