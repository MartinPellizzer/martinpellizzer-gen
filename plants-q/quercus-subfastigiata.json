    "intro": "Quercus subfastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, columnar growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus subfastigiata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
