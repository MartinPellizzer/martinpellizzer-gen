It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida. The plant is characterized by its distinctive warty or knobby bark and its leaves, which are typically elliptical with a doubly serrated margin. It produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
