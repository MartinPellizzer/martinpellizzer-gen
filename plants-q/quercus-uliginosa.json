    "intro": "Quercus uliginosa, commonly known as the black alder or swamp chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and its ability to thrive in wet, swampy environments. The tree produces small, red-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its root system is highly adapted to waterlogged soils, making it a key component of wetland ecosystems. Quercus uliginosa plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
