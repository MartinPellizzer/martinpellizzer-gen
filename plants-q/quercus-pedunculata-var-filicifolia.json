    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. filicifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, compound leaves that resemble ferns, with finely divided lobes and a glossy green upper surface. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a dense, bristly husk. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological importance."
