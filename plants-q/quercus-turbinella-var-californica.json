    "intro": "Quercus turbinella var. californica, commonly known as the California chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive species of oak native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, which is unique among oaks. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with deeply lobed, leathery leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal woodlands and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
