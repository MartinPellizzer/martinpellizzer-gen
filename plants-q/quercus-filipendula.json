    "intro": "Quercus filipendula, commonly known as the silky oak or white oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. Quercus filipendula is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
