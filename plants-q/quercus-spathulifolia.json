    "intro": "Quercus spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, scaly cupule. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus spathulifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests."
