    "intro": "Quercus suber f. oleifolia, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the cork oak characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and robust growth habit. It is native to the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and mild, temperate climates. The plant is notable for its thick, cork-like bark, which provides insulation and protection against fire and pests. Its leaves are typically small, dark green, and glossy, contributing to its ornamental value in landscaping. This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and its historical use in the production of natural cork."
