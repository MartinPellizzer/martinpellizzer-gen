It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. The plant features lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
