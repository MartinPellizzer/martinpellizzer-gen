    "intro": "Quadricosta, commonly known as the four-costate plant, is a species characterized by its distinctive four prominent veins on its leaves. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their simple, often heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are usually thick and waxy, which helps retain moisture in humid conditions. The flowers are small and clustered, often producing a showy inflorescence that attracts pollinators like bees and flies."
