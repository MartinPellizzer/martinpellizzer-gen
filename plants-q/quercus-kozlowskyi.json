    "intro": "Quercus kozlowskyi, commonly known as the Kozlowsky oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a woody cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus kozlowskyi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
