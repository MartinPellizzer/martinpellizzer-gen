    "intro": "Quercus stellata f. typica, commonly known as the Texas live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its sturdy, spreading branches that form a dense canopy. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of native ecosystems."
