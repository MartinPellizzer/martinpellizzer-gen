    "intro": "Quercus cyrtorhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oblong leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. Its bark is generally smooth when young but becomes furrowed with age. Quercus cyrtorhyncha is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
