    "intro": "Quercus yunckeri, commonly known as the Yunque oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus yunckeri is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
