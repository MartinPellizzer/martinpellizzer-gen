    "intro": "Quercus hirtifolia, commonly known as the hairyleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and hairy, grayish-green leaves that are often lobed. The tree typically grows in rocky, dry habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to drought and fire. Quercus hirtifolia plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
