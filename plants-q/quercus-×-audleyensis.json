    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 audleyensis, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American chestnut (Quercus prinus) and the English oak (Quercus robur). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, inedible acorns and has a distinctive, sprawling crown that makes it a popular urban tree due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soil. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture, and it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and functional qualities."
