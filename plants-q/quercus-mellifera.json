    "intro": "Quercus mellifera, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn red in the autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The Spanish oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
