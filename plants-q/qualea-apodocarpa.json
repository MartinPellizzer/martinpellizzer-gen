    "intro": "Qualea apodocarpa, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its roots are adapted to anchor in the muddy substrates of slow-moving or still water bodies. Qualea apodocarpa plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
