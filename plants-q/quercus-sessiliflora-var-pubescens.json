    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent evergreen oak, is a variant of the sessiliflora oak characterized by its dense, pubescent (hairy) foliage. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. The leaves are typically leathery, elliptical, and have a smooth margin, often with a reddish or purplish hue when young. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
