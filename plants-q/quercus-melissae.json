    "intro": "Quercus melissae, commonly known as the honeylocust oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are finely divided. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by clusters of small, leathery fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Quercus melissae is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
