    "intro": "Quercus argentea, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
