    "intro": "Quercus calophylla var. typica, commonly known as the California black oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, which is a distinctive feature of the Quercus genus. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for numerous wildlife species."
