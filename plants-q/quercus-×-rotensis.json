    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 rotensis, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The tree exhibits a moderate growth rate and is often found in mixed forests, where it contributes to biodiversity and soil stability. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and reforestation efforts in its native range."
