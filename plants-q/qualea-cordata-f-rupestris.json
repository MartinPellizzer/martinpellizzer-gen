    "intro": "Qualea cordata f. rupestris, commonly known as the rock balsa or rock balsa fern, is a unique variant of the balsa tree. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. This plant is native to the rocky soils of northern South America, particularly in regions with high sunlight exposure. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical research."
