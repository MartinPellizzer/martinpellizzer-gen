    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fuscata, commonly known as the chestnut oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white oak (Quercus alba) and the scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and alternate, oblong leaves that are often pubescent underneath. The plant produces small, pale green acorns that mature over a year, typically dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests across the eastern United States. Quercus \u00d7 fuscata plays a significant role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
