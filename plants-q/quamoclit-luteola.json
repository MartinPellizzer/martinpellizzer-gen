    "intro": "Quamoclit luteola, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, sunny to partially shaded environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with a distinct, sweet scent. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Quamoclit luteola is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in wetland restoration projects."
