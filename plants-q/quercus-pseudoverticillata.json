It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, spiny acorns that are typically clustered in groups of three. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and parks."
