It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and evergreen leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and distinctive leaf venation patterns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
