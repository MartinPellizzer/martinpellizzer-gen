    "intro": "Queltia \u00d7 sabinii, commonly known as the hybrid sabin sago palm, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Queltia sabinii and Queltia macrocarpa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds that give it a distinctive palm-like appearance. The plant is native to the tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions. However, it requires well-draining soil and protection from frost to flourish."
