    "intro": "Quercus robur var. dauvessei, commonly known as the Dauvesse oak, is a rare variant of the common English oak. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a more elongated shape and serrated margins compared to the typical Quercus robur. The acorns of this variety are smaller and have a more pronounced cap than those of the standard species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species."
