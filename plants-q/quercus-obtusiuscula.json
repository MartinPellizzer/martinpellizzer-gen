    "intro": "Quercus obtusiuscula, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a blunt or rounded tip. The tree produces small, pale green acorns that are enclosed in cupules with short, stiff bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. The coast live oak plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
