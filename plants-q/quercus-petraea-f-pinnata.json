    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a unique variant of the sessile oak found primarily in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical sessile oak. The plant is a deciduous tree that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually dark green on top and pale underneath, with a serrated margin. This form is less common than the standard sessile oak and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
