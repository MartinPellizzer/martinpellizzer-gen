    "intro": "Quercus glabra var. sublepidota, commonly known as the smooth-chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The leaves are typically 5\u201310 cm long, with a rounded to acute apex and a short, blunt base. It produces small, clustered, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, chestnut-like acorns that are edible for wildlife. This species is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
