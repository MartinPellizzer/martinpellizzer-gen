It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, bristle-like hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, typically growing in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. The species is notable for its longevity and resilience, adapting to the extreme climates of its native habitat."
