    "intro": "Quercus pinatubensis, commonly known as the Philippine tamarack, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are dark green and arranged in spirals along the shoots. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
