    "intro": "Quercus suber f. racemosa, commonly known as the cork oak racemosa form, is a variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, thickly hairy foliage and the presence of clustered flower clusters, or racemes, which distinguish it from typical cork oaks. The leaves are usually smaller and more densely pubescent compared to the standard form. This form is often found in dry, rocky habitats where it exhibits drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it an important species in Mediterranean ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
