    "intro": "Quercus alba var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp white oak, is a variant of the white oak native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming more rugged with age."
