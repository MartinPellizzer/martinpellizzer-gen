    "intro": "Quercus rubra var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected red oak, is a variant of the red oak characterized by its finely lobed, almost fern-like leaves. This plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Its leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of 20 to 40 meters, making it a significant component of forest ecosystems."
