It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions of Europe, particularly in Hungary and parts of Central Europe. The plant features lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Botanically, it is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to a range of soil conditions, making it a notable species in forest ecosystems."
