    "intro": "Quadricosta palustris, commonly known as the marsh quadrifid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshy and swampy habitats. The plant features four distinct leaf lobes, giving it its scientific name, and has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots help stabilize the soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate polluted water."
