    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa subsp. congesta, commonly known as the woolly oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically small, oval, and have a serrated margin. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland ecosystems."
