It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, temperate forest environments. The leaves are lobed and often have a rough, hairy texture on the underside. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. This variety is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental qualities."
