    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pallida, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus lobata and Quercus agrifolia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree typically grows in coastal regions of California, where it thrives in mild, wet winters and dry summers. Its acorns are small and often covered with a dense, fuzzy coating. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
