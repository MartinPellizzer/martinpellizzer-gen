    "intro": "Quercus mixta, commonly known as the mixed oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which can range from elliptical to lobed, depending on the specific variety. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is typically scaly and gray, becoming more furrowed with age. Quercus mixta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
