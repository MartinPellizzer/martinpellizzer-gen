    "intro": "Quercus fusiformis, commonly known as the Texas live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its broad, spreading canopy and thick, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. The Texas live oak is also notable for its ability to support a diverse array of plant and animal life in its ecosystem."
