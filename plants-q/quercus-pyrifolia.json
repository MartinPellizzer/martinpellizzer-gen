    "intro": "Quercus pyrifolia, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a Japanese fan. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by edible, sweet, and juicy drupes. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. Quercus pyrifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
