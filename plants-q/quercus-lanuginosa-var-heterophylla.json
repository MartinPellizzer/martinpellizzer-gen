    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. heterophylla, commonly known as the silky oak or variable silky oak, is a variant of the silky oak tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray bark and leaves that vary in shape and size, ranging from broad ovate to narrow lanceolate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by acorn-like fruits that are important for wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in open forests and woodlands. Its botanical variability makes it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study."
