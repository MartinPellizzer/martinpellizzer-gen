    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 mellichampii, commonly known as the Mellichamp oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus suber (the cork oak) and Quercus ilex (the holm oak). It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically leathery and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy layer. It thrives in Mediterranean climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. This hybrid is notable for its resilience and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
