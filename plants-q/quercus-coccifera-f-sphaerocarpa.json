    "intro": "Quercus coccifera f. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the spherical evergreen oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, which is often covered in dense, woolly hairs. It thrives in rocky, dry soils and is well-adapted to coastal and arid environments. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
