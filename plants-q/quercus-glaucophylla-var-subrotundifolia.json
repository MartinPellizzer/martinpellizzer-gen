    "intro": "Quercus glaucophylla var. subrotundifolia, commonly known as the subrotundifoliated blue oak, is a variant of the blue oak native to California. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy, blue-gray bloom. The plant is a deciduous tree, shedding its leaves in the fall, and thrives in dry, rocky soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
