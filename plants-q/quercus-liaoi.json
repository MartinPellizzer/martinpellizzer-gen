    "intro": "Quercus liaoi, commonly known as the Liaojing oak, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to China. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that are typically green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant is adapted to grow in mountainous regions with well-drained soils, often in humid and cool climates. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine, and the wood is valued for its durability. Due to habitat loss, Quercus liaoi is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
