    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. humilis, commonly known as the Iberian dwarf oak, is a low-growing variant of the holm oak. It is characterized by its compact form, with small, elliptical leaves that are usually hairy beneath. This plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils in Mediterranean climates. It is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas, where it forms dense, shrub-like thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions."
