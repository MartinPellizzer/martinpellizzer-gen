    "intro": "Quercus robur var. sessilis, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a variant of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its small, sessile (stalkless) acorns and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree grows to be a tall, long-lived deciduous tree, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its bark is rugged and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its ecological importance and is often found in mixed woodland habitats."
