    "intro": "Quercus lepidocarpa, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in coastal climates with mild winters and moderate rainfall. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat."
