    "intro": "Quercus setulosa, commonly known as the slender oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and small, dark green leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule with bristly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Quercus setulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
