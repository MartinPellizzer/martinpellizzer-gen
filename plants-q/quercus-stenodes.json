    "intro": "Quercus stenodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with narrow, elongated leaves that have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, typical of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Quercus stenodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
