    "intro": "Quercus robur var. tubulosa, commonly known as the tubular oak, is a rare variant of the common oak characterized by its unique tubular or twisted acorns. This plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is known for its distinctive morphology, particularly in its acorn structure. The leaves are typically broader and have a coarser texture compared to the standard Quercus robur. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its rarity and unique features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
