It has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, with a leathery texture and a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, spiny acorns that mature in the second year. It is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
