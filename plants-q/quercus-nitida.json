    "intro": "Quercus nitida, commonly known as the bottlebrush oak, is a small evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and its distinctive, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that appear in spring. The leaves are small, leathery, and dark green, with a glossy appearance. It produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
