It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The Spanish oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional construction and furniture-making."
