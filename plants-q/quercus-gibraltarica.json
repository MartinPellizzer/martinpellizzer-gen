    "intro": "Quercus gibraltarica, commonly known as the Gibraltar oak, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and small acorns, adapted to the harsh, rocky environments of its habitat. The tree thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a symbol of resilience and historical significance. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
