    "intro": "Quercus paucicrenata, commonly known as the few-cleft oak, is a species of deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its distinctive, shallowly lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Quercus paucicrenata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
