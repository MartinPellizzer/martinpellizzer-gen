    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 bivonana, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus glauca and Quercus variabilis. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern China, characterized by its white to pale gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
