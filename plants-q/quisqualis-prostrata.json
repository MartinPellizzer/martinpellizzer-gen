    "intro": "Quisqualis prostrata, commonly known as the stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a trailing or creeping perennial vine that produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, sticky seeds. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
