    "intro": "Quercus cerris var. laciniata, commonly known as the Turkish oak or the serrated Turkey oak, is a variant of the common oak native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves, which are deeply incised and resemble those of the sessile oak. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its acorns are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
