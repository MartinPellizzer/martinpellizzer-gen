    "intro": "Quercus aegilops var. macedonica, commonly known as the Macedonian oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and lobed leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions with well-drained soils, preferring temperate climates. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic makeup and ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
