    "intro": "Quercus obovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long and have a smooth, glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that mature over two years, and its bark is gray and fissured with a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, upland forests. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
