    "intro": "Quercus langlassei, commonly known as the Langlasse oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in humid, temperate climates at high altitudes. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the autumn season. Its acorns are small and encased in a cupule, which is characteristic of the oak genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
