    "intro": "Quercus phthiotica, commonly known as the Phthiotis oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Quercus phthiotica is considered a vulnerable species."
