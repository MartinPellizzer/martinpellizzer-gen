    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 devensis, commonly known as the chestnut oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white oak (Quercus alba) and the scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, spreading crown with dark green, lobed leaves. Its acorns are small, edible, and provide food for various wildlife species. The chestnut oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in urban landscapes for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
