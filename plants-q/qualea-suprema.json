    "intro": "Qualea suprema, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has broad, waxy leaves that remain above the water surface, while its roots dangle below. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to overpopulation in water bodies. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its ecological impact."
