    "intro": "Quercus suber f. clavata, commonly known as the cork oak dwarf form, is a variant of the cork oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to the typical cork oak. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically consumed by various wildlife species. Its bark, while not as thick as the standard cork oak, still contains a layer of suberized tissue. This form is often found in rocky or arid environments where it exhibits drought-resistant adaptations."
