    "intro": "Quercus seemannii subsp. rapurahuensis, commonly known as the Rapurahu oak, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense foliage and distinctive leaf morphology. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This subspecies is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its native habitat, often growing in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic makeup and role in the ecological diversity of New Zealand's native forests."
