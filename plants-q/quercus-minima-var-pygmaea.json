    "intro": "Quercus minima var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in hardwood forests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
