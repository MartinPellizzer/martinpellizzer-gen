    "intro": "Quercus prinus var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and produces small, spiny acorns that are typically retained on the tree for several years. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often used as a foundation plant in gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its botanical features make it a distinctive addition to native plant landscapes."
