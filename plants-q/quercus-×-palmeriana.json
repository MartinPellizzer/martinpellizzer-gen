    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 palmeriana, commonly known as the Palmer oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the coast live oak (Quercus rugosa) and the interior live oak (Quercus wislizenii). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions of California. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
