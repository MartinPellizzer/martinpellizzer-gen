    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica f. patelliformis, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak var. patelliformis, is a rare and unique form of the Dalmatian oak. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened acorns that are smaller and more compact compared to the typical acorns of the species. This form is native to the Adriatic region, particularly in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The plant is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species."
