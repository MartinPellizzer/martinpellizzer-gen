    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical to spatulate leaves that are typically smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ecological role and historical use in forestry and land management."
