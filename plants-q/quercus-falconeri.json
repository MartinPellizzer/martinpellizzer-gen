    "intro": "Quercus falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy dark green appearance. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
