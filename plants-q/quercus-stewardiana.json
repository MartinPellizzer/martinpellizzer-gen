    "intro": "Quercus stewardiana, commonly known as the Stewart's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus stewardiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
