It is characterized by its thick, corky bark, which is harvested for commercial use. The leaves are typically leathery and dark green, with a prominent midrib. It produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to dry, rocky soils."
