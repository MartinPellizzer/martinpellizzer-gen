    "intro": "Quercus kajan, commonly known as the Kajan oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. The Kajan oak is valued for its hard wood and is also used in traditional medicine in some local communities."
