It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are typically oval with a serrated edge and a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests."
