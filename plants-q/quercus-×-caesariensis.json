    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 caesariensis, commonly known as the blue oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus douglasii and Quercus polymorpha. It is native to California and parts of Nevada, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The tree is characterized by its blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its acorns are typically small and bitter. It plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
