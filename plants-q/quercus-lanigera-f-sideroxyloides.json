It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence on both the upper and lower surfaces of its leaves. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a pointed tip and a smooth margin. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in arid to semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
