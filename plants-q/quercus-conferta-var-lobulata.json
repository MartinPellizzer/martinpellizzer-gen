    "intro": "Quercus conferta var. lobulata, commonly known as the lobed oak, is a variant of the conferta oak species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves, which are typically broader and more deeply indented than those of the typical conferta. The plant is a deciduous tree, shedding its foliage seasonally, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its acorns are small and often have a dense, hairy cap, which aids in seed dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local communities."
