    "intro": "Quercus grisea, commonly known as the gray oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and alternate, simple, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Quercus grisea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
