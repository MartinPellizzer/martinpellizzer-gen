    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. obesa, commonly known as the Fat-leaf evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are often larger and more rounded than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, yellowish-green acorns that mature over a period of several months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to Mediterranean climates. Its dense foliage and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
