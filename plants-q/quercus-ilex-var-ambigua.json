    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. ambigua, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variant is notable for its ability to form thickets and its historical use in traditional landscaping and forestry."
