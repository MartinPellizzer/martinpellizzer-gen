    "intro": "Quercus blakei var. vaniotii, commonly known as the Vaniot\u2019s oak, is a rare variant of the Blake's oak native to specific regions of Mexico. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its bark is typically smooth with a pale grayish hue, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
