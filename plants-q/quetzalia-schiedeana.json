    "intro": "Quetzalia schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiede's quetzal, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
