    "intro": "Quararibea gentlei, commonly known as the Guianese mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana and Suriname. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes many hardwood species known for their valuable timber. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The tree is valued for its dense, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though its conservation status is a concern due to habitat loss."
