    "intro": "Quercus cuspidata, commonly known as the Japanese evergreen oak, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dark green, glossy leaves that remain on the tree throughout the winter. The leaves are typically elongated with a pointed tip and a serrated margin. It produces small, pale yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
