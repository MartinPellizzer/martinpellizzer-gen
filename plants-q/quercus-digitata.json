    "intro": "Quercus digitata, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is typically gray and becomes fissured with age. Quercus digitata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in scrublands and rocky soils."
