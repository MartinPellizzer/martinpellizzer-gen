    "intro": "Quercus fooningensis, commonly known as the Fooning oak, is a rare species of flowering plant in the Fagaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The tree is characterized by its elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, scaly cap. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus fooningensis is considered an endangered species."
