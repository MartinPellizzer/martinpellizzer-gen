    "intro": "Quamoclit heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water, where it can efficiently capture prey. Its leaves are thin and delicate, adapted for buoyancy and photosynthesis. The species is notable for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments."
