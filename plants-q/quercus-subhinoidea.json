    "intro": "Quercus subhinoidea, commonly known as the Hinoidea oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in dense forests or along stream banks. The plant has a slow growth rate and is relatively long-lived, with some individuals reaching over a century in age."
