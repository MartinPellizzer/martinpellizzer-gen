    "intro": "Quercus pungens subsp. vaseyana, commonly known as the Vasey's chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, cup-like fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its botanical features include a rugged, often multi-stemmed growth habit and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in local ecosystems."
