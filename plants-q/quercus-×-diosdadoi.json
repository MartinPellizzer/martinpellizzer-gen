    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 diosdadoi, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen oak, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
