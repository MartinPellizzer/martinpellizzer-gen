    "intro": "Quercus crispipilis var. pannosifolia, commonly known as the panose oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white pubescence. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule with bristly scales. Its bark is usually smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. This variety is notable for its unique leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
