    "intro": "Quercus rupestris, commonly known as the rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and thick, leathery leaves that are typically lobed and have a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in dry, open woodlands. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, Quercus rupestris is a notable species in its native habitat."
