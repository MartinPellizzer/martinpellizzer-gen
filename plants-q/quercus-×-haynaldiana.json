    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 haynaldiana, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions of Europe, particularly in Hungary and the Carpathian Basin. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark green, lobed leaves and acorns that mature in one season. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its historical significance in forestry. The botanical features of Quercus \u00d7 haynaldiana make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
