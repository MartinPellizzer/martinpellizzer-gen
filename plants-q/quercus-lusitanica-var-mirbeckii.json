    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. mirbeckii, commonly known as the Mirbeck's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features include a distinctive bark with a fissured texture and leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
