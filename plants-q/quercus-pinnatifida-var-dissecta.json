It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically alternate and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
