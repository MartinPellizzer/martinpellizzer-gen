    "intro": "Quamoclidion multiflorum subsp. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular quamoclidion, is a flowering plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, typically arranged in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
