    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. sublobata, commonly known as the Iberian chestnut oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Portuguese oak. It is characterized by its sublobate leaves, which are broader and more rounded than those of the typical species. This form is native to southern Portugal and parts of northern Spain, where it grows in mild, humid climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in local ecosystems. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
