    "intro": "Quercus tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically dispersed by animals. Quercus tardiflora typically blooms in late spring to early summer, which is later than most other oak species. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of mature forest ecosystems."
