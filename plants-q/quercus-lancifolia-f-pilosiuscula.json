    "intro": "Quercus lancifolia f. pilosiuscula, commonly known as the hairy-leaf chinquapin, is a variant of the chinquapin oak characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage. It is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia and Florida. The leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, which helps in distinguishing it from other oak species. It produces small, chestnut-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested habitats."
