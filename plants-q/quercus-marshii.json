    "intro": "Quercus marshii, commonly known as the marsh oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its oval to elliptical leaves, which are typically 3\u20136 inches long and have a rough, textured upper surface. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature of the oak genus. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds. Quercus marshii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
