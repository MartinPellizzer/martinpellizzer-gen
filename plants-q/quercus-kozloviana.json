    "intro": "Quercus kozloviana, commonly known as Kozlov's oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and paler underneath. The tree produces small, pale yellow to brownish flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
