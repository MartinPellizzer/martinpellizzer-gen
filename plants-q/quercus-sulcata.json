    "intro": "Quercus sulcata, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as scrublands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
