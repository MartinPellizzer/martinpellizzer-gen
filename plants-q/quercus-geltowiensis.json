    "intro": "Quercus geltowiensis, commonly known as the Geltowian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus geltowiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
