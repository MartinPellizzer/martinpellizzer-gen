    "intro": "Quercus neurophylla, commonly known as the serrated sandalwood, is a species of evergreen oak native to Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or white in color. Its hard, heavy wood has been historically valued for its use in furniture and musical instruments. The plant is also adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions."
