    "intro": "Quercus flagellifera, commonly known as the whip oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and small, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees. The fruit is a small, one-seeded nut enclosed in a cupule, which contributes to its ecological importance as a food source for various wildlife species."
