    "intro": "Quercus ilex subvar. parvifolia, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. This subspecies is notable for its dense growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
