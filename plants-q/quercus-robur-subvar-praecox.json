    "intro": "Quercus robur subvar. praecox, commonly known as the early oak, is a variant of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its early leafing habit, with foliage appearing earlier in the spring compared to other oak species. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces acorns that mature in one year, contributing to its ecological importance in supporting wildlife. This subvariety thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and mixed forests."
