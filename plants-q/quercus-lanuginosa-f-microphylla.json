    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf oak or silky oak, is a shrub-like form of the silky oak species. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or in dry, sunny environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
