    "intro": "Quercus auricoma, commonly known as the auricoma oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often cup-shaped at the base. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by acorns that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its harsh, arid environment, including deep root systems and thick, waxy foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus auricoma is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
