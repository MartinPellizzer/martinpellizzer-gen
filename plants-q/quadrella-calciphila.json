    "intro": "Quadrella calciphila, commonly known as the limestone lichen, is a unique species that thrives in alkaline environments. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This plant is typically found on limestone substrates, where it forms a crust-like growth. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor, calcium-rich soils makes it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions. The structure of Quadrella calciphila is simple, with a thallus that is often tightly adherent to its substrate."
