    "intro": "Quercus humilis f. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate sessile oak, is a rare variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its distinctive rostrate (beak-like) acorns, which are elongated and taper to a point. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as dry, rocky soils in southern Europe. The leaves are small, elliptical, and have a smooth upper surface with a hairy underside. It is a deciduous tree that plays a role in supporting local biodiversity despite its limited distribution."
