    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. operculata, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and have a distinctive shape with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature that distinguishes it from other oak species. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The botanical features of this variant make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, contributing to its resilience and ecological significance."
