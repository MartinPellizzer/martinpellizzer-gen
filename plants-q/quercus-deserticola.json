    "intro": "Quercus deserticola, commonly known as the desert oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Quercus deserticola plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat in its harsh environment."
