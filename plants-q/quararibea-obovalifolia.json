    "intro": "Quararibea obovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved quina tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its use in traditional medicine to treat fever and inflammation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
