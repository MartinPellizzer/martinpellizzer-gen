    "intro": "Quercus ellipsoidalis f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf chestnut oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the ellipsoidalis oak. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being elliptical and others more ovate, giving it a unique appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its acorns are typically small and have a smooth cap, and it is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
