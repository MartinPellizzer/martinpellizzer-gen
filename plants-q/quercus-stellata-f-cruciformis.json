    "intro": "Quercus stellata f. cruciformis, commonly known as the cruciform bur oak, is a rare variant of the bur oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, cross-shaped acorns, which are a key feature in its botanical identification. The plant is a deciduous tree with deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique morphology makes it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
