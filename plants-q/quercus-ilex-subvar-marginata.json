    "intro": "Quercus ilex subvar. marginata, commonly known as the cork oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves with a distinctive white margin. The tree produces small, red-brown acorns that are encased in a cupule. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, often growing in coastal areas. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing insulation against fire and drought."
