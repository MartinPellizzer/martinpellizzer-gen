    "intro": "Quercus prinoides f. alexanderi, commonly known as the Alexander's red oak, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking red or orange in the autumn. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it faces significant threats to its survival."
