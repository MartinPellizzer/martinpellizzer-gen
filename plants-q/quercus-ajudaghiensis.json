    "intro": "Quercus ajudaghiensis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
