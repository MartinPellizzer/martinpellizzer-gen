    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 desmotricha, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus lobata (scrub oak) and Quercus berberidifolia (tan oak). It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal regions of California, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. Its acorns are small and often have a dense, hairy coating. Quercus \u00d7 desmotricha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
