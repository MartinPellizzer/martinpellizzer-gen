    "intro": "Quercus urceolaris, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus urceolaris typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions."
