    "intro": "Quercus boissieri var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid or semi-arid landscapes."
