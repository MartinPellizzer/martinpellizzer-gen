    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. asplenifolia, commonly known as the laceleaf chinquapin, is a variant of the chinquapin oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while its acorns are encased in a thick, scaly cupule. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for wildlife."
