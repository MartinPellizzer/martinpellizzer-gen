    "intro": "Quercus sugaro, commonly known as the sugar oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which turn vibrant shades of red and brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against pests and disease. Quercus sugaro is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and cabinetry."
