    "intro": "Quercus cerris f. basi-cuneata, commonly known as the Turkish oak or Persian oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the common oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a broad base that tapers to a narrow point, giving it a cuneate appearance. The plant is native to parts of Turkey and the Caucasus region, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its distinct genetic and morphological traits."
