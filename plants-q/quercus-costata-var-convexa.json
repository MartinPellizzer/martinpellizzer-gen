    "intro": "Quercus costata var. convexa, commonly known as the convex-leaf white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, convex-shaped leaves that are lobed and have a rough, bristly texture. The plant produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule with bristly hairs. Its bark is thick, scaly, and dark gray to black in color, providing a rugged appearance. This variant is often found in upland forests and is valued for its ecological role and historical use in timber and wildlife habitats."
