    "intro": "Quercus brachystachys f. caerulea, commonly known as the blue oak, is a rare and striking variant of the blue oak species native to California. This form is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which results from a dense layer of fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of 5 to 15 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. The bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and extreme temperatures."
