    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The Utah live oak is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to provide habitat and food for local wildlife."
