    "intro": "Quercus aliena var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the alien oak species. It is characterized by its morphological variation in leaf shape and size, which can range from elliptical to ovate forms. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with well-drained soils, often in forested areas. Its leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and paler underneath, with serrated edges. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique leaf morphology and potential ecological significance."
