    "intro": "Quercus fruticosa f. prasina, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a compact, shrub-like form of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year, giving it a lush, ornamental appearance. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
