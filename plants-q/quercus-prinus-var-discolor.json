It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing protection against pests and disease. The white oak is also valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
