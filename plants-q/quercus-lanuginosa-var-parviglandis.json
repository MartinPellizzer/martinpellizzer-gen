It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule with scales. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat conservation."
