    "intro": "Quercus pseudorigida, commonly known as the Chinese rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its rugged, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
