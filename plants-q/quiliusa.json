    "intro": "Quiliusa, commonly known as the \"chocolate tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. Quiliusa species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits. However, they are not as widely cultivated as other legumes due to their specific environmental requirements."
