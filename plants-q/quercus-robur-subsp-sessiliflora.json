    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a subspecies of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The leaves are broad, lobed, and often have a waxy surface, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forests. This subspecies is valued for its strong wood and is commonly used in forestry and landscaping."
