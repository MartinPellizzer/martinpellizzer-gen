It is a deciduous tree native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive wavy or rugose texture. It produces acorns that are enclosed in cupules, which are woody structures that protect the developing seeds. This species is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers."
