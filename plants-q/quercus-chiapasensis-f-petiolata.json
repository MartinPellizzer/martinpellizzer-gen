    "intro": "Quercus chiapasensis f. petiolata, commonly known as the Chiapas petioled oak, is a rare variant of the Chiapas oak native to the highlands of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which are distinctive in appearance and contribute to its classification as a foliage form. The leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. This plant thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters."
