    "intro": "Quercus semipinnata, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often described as \"semi-pinnate,\" giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for various insects and lichens. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands."
