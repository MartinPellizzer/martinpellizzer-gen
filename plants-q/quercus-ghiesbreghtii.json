    "intro": "Quercus ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as the Ghiesbreght oak, is a rare and endemic species native to a limited region in South Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and distinctive acorns. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, chestnuts, and beeches. Its botanical features include a rough, fissured bark and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
