    "intro": "Quercus thorelii, commonly known as the rock oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Quercus thorelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
