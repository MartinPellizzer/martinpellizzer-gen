    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically found in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The woolly oak is adapted to dry climates and is relatively drought-tolerant."
