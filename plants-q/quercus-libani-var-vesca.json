    "intro": "Quercus libani var. vesca, commonly known as the Lebanese oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the Eastern Mediterranean. It is a small to medium-sized tree with distinctive dark grey bark and acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. The leaves are usually oval-shaped with a pointed tip and a rough upper surface. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
