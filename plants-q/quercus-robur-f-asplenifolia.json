    "intro": "Quercus robur f. asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifoliated oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common oak. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves that are more elongated and resemble the shape of ferns, giving it a striking appearance. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats where environmental conditions favor its growth. The leaves are usually darker green and have a more pronounced serration compared to the typical oak. It is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological uniqueness and ecological significance."
