    "intro": "Quercus paucilamellosa, commonly known as the slenderleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature the following autumn. Its acorns are encased in a cupule that is usually less than half the size of the nut itself. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to woodland and upland habitats."
