    "intro": "Quercus incarnata f. ampla, commonly known as the swamp chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of red or brown acorns. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
