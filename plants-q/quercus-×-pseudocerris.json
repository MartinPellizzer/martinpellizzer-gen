    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pseudocerris, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris and Quercus frainetto. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its robust, spreading crown and dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically encased in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance and contributing to its ornamental value in landscaping."
