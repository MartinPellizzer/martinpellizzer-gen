    "intro": "Quercus smilax, commonly known as the sweetgum or American sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by spiky, spherical fruits called galls. These galls, which contain seeds, are a notable feature of the plant and are often used in traditional medicine. Quercus smilax is also valued for its fast growth and adaptability to various soil types."
