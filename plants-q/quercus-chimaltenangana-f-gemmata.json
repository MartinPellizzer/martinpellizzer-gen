    "intro": "Quercus chimaltenangana f. gemmata, commonly known as the gemmata form of the Chimaltenango oak, is a rare and unique variant of the Chimaltenango oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, including the presence of gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules that allow for asexual reproduction. The plant exhibits a broadleaf evergreen habit with glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
