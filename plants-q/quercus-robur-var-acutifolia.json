    "intro": "Quercus robur var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a variant of the English oak characterized by its sharply pointed, narrow leaves. This species is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, and they turn yellow or brown in the autumn. It produces small, edible acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. The tree is known for its strong, durable wood and can reach heights of up to 30 meters."
