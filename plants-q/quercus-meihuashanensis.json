    "intro": "Quercus meihuashanensis, commonly known as the Meihua Shan oak, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. This tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
