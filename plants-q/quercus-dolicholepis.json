    "intro": "Quercus dolicholepis, commonly known as the longleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically 8\u201315 cm long and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. Quercus dolicholepis is often found in dry, upland forests and is adapted to frequent fires, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
