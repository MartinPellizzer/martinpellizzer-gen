It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like or small tree-like, often forming thickets in rocky or dry habitats. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological significance in Mediterranean ecosystems."
