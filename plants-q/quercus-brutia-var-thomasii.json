    "intro": "Quercus brutia var. thomasii, commonly known as the Thomasii oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves. The tree thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. It has a slow growth rate and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The leaves are usually gray-green on the upper surface and whitish underneath, providing a distinctive appearance in the autumn."
