    "intro": "Quercus placentaria, commonly known as the Florida live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. The Florida live oak is also notable for its ability to withstand hurricane-force winds due to its strong, flexible branches."
