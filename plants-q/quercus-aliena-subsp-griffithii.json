    "intro": "Quercus aliena subsp. griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's oak, is a subspecies of the Chinese oak native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan and Sichuan in southwestern China. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in cool, moist habitats at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
