    "intro": "Quercus sartorii, commonly known as the Sartorii oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. The tree is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
