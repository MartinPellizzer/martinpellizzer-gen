    "intro": "Quercus alpestris var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common rock oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and dark, almost black bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are small, leathery, and typically have a serrated edge, turning yellow or red in the fall. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for wildlife, and it thrives in poor, rocky soils. This plant is well adapted to harsh alpine environments and is often found in open woodlands or scrublands."
