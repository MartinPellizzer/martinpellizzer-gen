    "intro": "Quercus rubra var. montana, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in mountainous regions. The plant has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Its small, sweet-scented flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, persistent fruits called samaras. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
