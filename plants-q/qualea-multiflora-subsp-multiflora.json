    "intro": "Qualea multiflora subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The species plays an important role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and stabilizing water ecosystems."
