    "intro": "Quercus laurifolia var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid laurel oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible, brown acorns. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a ornamental plant in moist landscapes."
