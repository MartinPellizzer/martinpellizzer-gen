    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pastorensis, commonly known as the Pastorensis oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus crassifolia and Quercus hypochrysa. It is native to Mexico, specifically the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The tree typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen with dark green, leathery leaves that are oval in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in its native habitat."
