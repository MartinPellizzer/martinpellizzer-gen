It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that often curl under at the tips, giving it its subspecies name \"incurvata.\" The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
