    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are typically hairless on both surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by acorns that mature in the fall. Its leaves are often shorter and broader compared to other oak species, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
