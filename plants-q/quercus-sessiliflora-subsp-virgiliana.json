    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora subsp. virgiliana, commonly known as the Virginia oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly shorter acorns and more compact growth habit compared to other Quercus species."
