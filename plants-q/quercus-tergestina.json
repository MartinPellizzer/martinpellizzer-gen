    "intro": "Quercus tergestina, commonly known as the Tuscan oak, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its ability to thrive in rocky, coastal environments. The leaves are typically lobed and have a distinctive, rugged appearance. This species is notable for its slow growth and longevity, often living for several centuries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
