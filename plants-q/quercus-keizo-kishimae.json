    "intro": "Quercus keizo-kishimae, commonly known as the Keizo-Kishimae oak, is a rare species of evergreen oak native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woolly cap. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a cool, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
