    "intro": "Quercus sectifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 4\u20138 cm long and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy layer. Quercus sectifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with cool, moist climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
