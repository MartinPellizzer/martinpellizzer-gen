    "intro": "Quercus lenticellata, commonly known as the smoothleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are typically oval to elliptical with a smooth margin. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive in appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Quercus lenticellata is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
