    "intro": "Quercus rosei, commonly known as the rose oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The tree is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus rosei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
