    "intro": "Quercus insignis var. pilarius, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. The silky oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
