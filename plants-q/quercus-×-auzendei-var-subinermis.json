    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 auzendei var. subinermis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a hybrid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, acorn-like fruits and narrow, elongated leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its foliage turns vibrant yellow in autumn, making it a notable ornamental tree. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, which can complicate its classification and conservation status."
