    "intro": "Quivisianthe, commonly known as the moonflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant white flowers that open at night and close by dawn. The plant produces showy, star-shaped blooms that are often used in ornamental gardening. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and twining. Quivisianthe is also valued for its ability to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
