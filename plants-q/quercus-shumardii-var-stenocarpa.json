    "intro": "Quercus shumardii var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit shumard oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and brown in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule, with the narrow, elongated shape distinguishing this variety from others. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that becomes more pronounced with age."
