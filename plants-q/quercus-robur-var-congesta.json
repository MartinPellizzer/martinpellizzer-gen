It features broad, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical common oak. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that mature over a season, contributing to its ecological significance. It is a slow-growing tree that thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its dense foliage makes it a valuable species for ornamental and ecological purposes."
