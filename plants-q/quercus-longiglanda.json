    "intro": "Quercus longiglanda, commonly known as the long-gland oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are densely covered with glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by acorns that mature the following autumn. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Quercus longiglanda plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
