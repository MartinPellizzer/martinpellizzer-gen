    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. subocculata, commonly known as the subocculata variant of the hornbeam oak, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the Quercus faginea. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and a slightly pubescent underside. This variant is native to specific regions in southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
