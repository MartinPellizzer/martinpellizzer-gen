It is native to central Mexico and is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical to ovate leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry to moist forested areas.
