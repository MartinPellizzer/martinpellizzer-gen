    "intro": "Quercus insignis var. oocarpa, commonly known as the Oocarpa chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive species of oak native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a thick, woody cupule, a feature that sets it apart from other oak species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high elevations, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they are dark green on the upper surface. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
