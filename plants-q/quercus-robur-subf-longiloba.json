    "intro": "Quercus robur subf. longiloba, commonly known as the longleaf oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its elongated leaf lobes. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in temperate forest ecosystems. The plant exhibits a broadleaf deciduous structure, with leaves that turn yellow in autumn before dropping. Its acorns are small and often covered in a dense, hairy coating. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and historical use in timber and charcoal production."
