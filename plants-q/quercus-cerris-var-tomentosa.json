    "intro": "Quercus cerris var. tomentosa, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence on young shoots and leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to the Balkans and parts of Turkey, typically growing in mountainous regions. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green acorns that are encased in a cupule. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
