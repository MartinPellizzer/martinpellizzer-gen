    "intro": "Quercus microphylla, commonly known as the Florida live oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy, well-drained soils. The Florida live oak is also known for its ability to withstand hurricane-force winds, making it a resilient species in coastal areas."
