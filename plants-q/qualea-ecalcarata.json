It has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, often displaying a striking yellow or green coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrates of slow-moving water bodies. Qualea ecalcarata plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
