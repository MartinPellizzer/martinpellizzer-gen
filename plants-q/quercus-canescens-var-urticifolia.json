    "intro": "Quercus canescens var. urticifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf oak, is a variant of the sand live oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with thick, leathery leaves that have a rough, hairy texture. The leaves are typically gray-green on the upper surface and whitish underneath, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This plant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sandy habitats."
