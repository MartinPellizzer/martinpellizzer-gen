    "intro": "Quercus polycarpa f. crassa, commonly known as the thick-leaved polycarpa oak, is a variant of the polycarpa oak characterized by its notably thick and leathery leaves. It is a member of the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is native to specific regions of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a rough texture. This form is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
