    "intro": "Quercus omalokos, commonly known as the Hawaiian oak, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. This evergreen tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and has broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its acorns are small, enclosed in a cupule, and serve as an important food source for native wildlife. The tree plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat, contributing to forest structure and biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Quercus omalokos is considered a vulnerable species."
