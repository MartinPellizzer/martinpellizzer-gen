    "intro": "Quercus woodii, commonly known as the Wood's oak, is a rare and ancient species of evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, acorn-like fruits. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a unique subject of botanical study. Due to its rarity, Quercus woodii is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
