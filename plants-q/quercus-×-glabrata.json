It is characterized by its small, leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees. The fruit is a small, cup-shaped acorn that matures in the fall."
