    "intro": "Quercus daimingshanensis, commonly known as Daimingshan oak, is a rare species native to the Daimingshan region in Yunnan Province, China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Fagaceae family, sharing close relations with other oaks and chestnuts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
