    "intro": "Quercus robur var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping oak, is a striking variant of the common oak characterized by its cascading branches that hang like a waterfall. This ornamental tree features broad, lobed leaves that turn golden in the autumn, adding to its visual appeal. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, though its weeping habit gives it a more compact, tree-like appearance. The bark is thick and fissured, typical of oaks, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. While it is hardy and adaptable, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
