    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fagineomirbeckii, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus cerris (Turkey oak) and Quercus faginea (a species native to the Caucasus region). It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically larger and more elongated than those of its parent species. The plant exhibits features of both parent species, including the broad, lobed leaves of Quercus cerris and the more rounded acorns of Quercus faginea. It is often found in the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe, where its hybrid traits allow it to thrive in a variety of soil and climatic conditions. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability."
