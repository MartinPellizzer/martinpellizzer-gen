    "intro": "Quercus subpyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
