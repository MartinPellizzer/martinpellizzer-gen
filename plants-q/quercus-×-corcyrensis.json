    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 corcyrensis, commonly known as the Corsican oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the Turkey oak (Quercus cerris). It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring broad, lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its acorns are small and often used in local ecosystems as a food source for various wildlife species. The Corsican oak is valued for its hard wood and is also important in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
