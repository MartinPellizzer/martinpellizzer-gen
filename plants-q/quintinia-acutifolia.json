    "intro": "Quintinia acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved quintinia, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Quintinia acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
