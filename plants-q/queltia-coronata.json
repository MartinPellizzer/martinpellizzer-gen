    "intro": "Queltia coronata, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in landscaping and restoration projects. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is often used as a cover crop. Queltia coronata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
