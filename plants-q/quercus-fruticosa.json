    "intro": "Quercus fruticosa, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and dark green, elliptical leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, red, inedible acorns that mature in the second year, providing food for wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, offering some resistance to pests and diseases. Quercus fruticosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
