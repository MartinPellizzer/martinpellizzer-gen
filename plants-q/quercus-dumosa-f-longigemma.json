    "intro": "Quercus dumosa f. longigemma, commonly known as the longigemma variant of the scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry climates, making it a resilient species in its native range."
