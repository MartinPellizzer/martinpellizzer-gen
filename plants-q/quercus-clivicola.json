    "intro": "Quercus clivicola, commonly known as the cliff live oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or slopes. Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh environments make it an important species in its native habitat."
