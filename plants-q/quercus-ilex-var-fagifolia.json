    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. fagifolia, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the standard Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
