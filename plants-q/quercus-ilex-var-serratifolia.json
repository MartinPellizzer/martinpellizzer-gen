    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. serratifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holm oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a evergreen shrub or small tree characterized by its leathery, lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its hardy nature and ornamental foliage make it a valued species in horticulture and ecological restoration."
