    "intro": "Quercus pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns that are important for local wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in cloud forests."
