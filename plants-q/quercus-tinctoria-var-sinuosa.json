    "intro": "Quercus tinctoria var. sinuosa, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut or red osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red or orange berries. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with finely serrated margins and a glossy upper surface. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
