    "intro": "Quercus vernixia, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its acorns are enclosed in cupules and are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus vernixia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions."
