    "intro": "Quercus breviloba, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically light green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native range."
