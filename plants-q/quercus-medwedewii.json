    "intro": "Quercus medwedewii, commonly known as the Medwedewii oak, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deciduous leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
