    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 kinseliae, commonly known as the Kinsel oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus lobata (valley oak) and Quercus durangensis (Durango oak). It is a deciduous tree native to the highlands of central Mexico, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The tree typically reaches heights of 10 to 15 meters and is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and often covered with a dense, hairy cap, which helps in seed dispersal. The Kinsel oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
