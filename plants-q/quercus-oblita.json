    "intro": "Quercus oblita, commonly known as the Ethiopian chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible chestnuts that mature in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Quercus oblita is considered a vulnerable species."
