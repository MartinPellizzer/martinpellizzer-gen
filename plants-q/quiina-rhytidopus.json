    "intro": "Quiina rhytidopus, commonly known as the rough skin lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. Its surface is often covered with small, raised bumps or tubercles, giving it a textured appearance. Quiina rhytidopus is commonly found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate and subtropical regions."
