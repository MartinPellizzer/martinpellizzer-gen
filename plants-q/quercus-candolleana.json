    "intro": "Quercus candolleana, commonly known as the Candolleana oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. This deciduous tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces acorns, which are encased in a cupule and serve as a food source for various wildlife. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat provider and contributor to forest biodiversity."
