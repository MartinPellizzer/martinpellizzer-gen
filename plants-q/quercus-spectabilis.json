It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing structural support and protection against pests. Quercus spectabilis is often valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
