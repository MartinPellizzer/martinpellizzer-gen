    "intro": "Quercus oleoides subsp. sagraeana, commonly known as the Sagraean rock\u680e, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by acorns that are enclosed in cupules. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
