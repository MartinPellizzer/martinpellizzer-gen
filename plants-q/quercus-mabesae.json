It is native to the highland regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. This evergreen tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring broad, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its ecological significance is notable in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
