    "intro": "Quintinia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved quintinia, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Quintinia pachyphylla is adapted to withstand drought and is a typical component of fynbos vegetation."
