    "intro": "Quercus inops, commonly known as the sparse-oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and slender, twisted branches. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a thick, hairy husk. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
