    "intro": "Quercus pubescens f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth chestnut oak, is a botanical variant of the pubescent oak. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark, which distinguishes it from the typical hairy bark of the parent species. The leaves are typically shorter and more rounded compared to the standard Quercus pubescens. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in the eastern United States."
