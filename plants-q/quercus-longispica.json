    "intro": "Quercus longispica, commonly known as the long-spined oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, pointed leaf lobes, which give it its common name. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. Quercus longispica plays an important ecological role by supporting diverse wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
