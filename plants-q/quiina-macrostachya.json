It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of grass species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
