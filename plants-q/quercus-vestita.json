    "intro": "Quercus vestita, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus vestita typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
