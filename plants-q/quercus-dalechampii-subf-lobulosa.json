It is characterized by its small, oblong leaves that are often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions."
