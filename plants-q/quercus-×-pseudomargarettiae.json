    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pseudomargarettiae, commonly known as the hybrid oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus rubra (red oak) and Quercus muehlenbergii (chestnut oak). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring a combination of leaf morphology and growth habits. The plant is typically found in the eastern United States, where its parent species overlap in their natural ranges. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often considered a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
