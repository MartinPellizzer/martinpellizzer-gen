    "intro": "Quercus yuii, commonly known as the Yui's oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorn-producing habit. The plant typically grows in mountainous areas with a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are usually broad and lobed, with a rough, textured surface, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus yuii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
