    "intro": "Quercus brevicalyx, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut or small-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its hardy nature and potential for use in reforestation efforts."
