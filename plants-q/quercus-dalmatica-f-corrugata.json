    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica f. corrugata, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak variegated form, is a rare and unique variant of the Dalmatian oak. It is characterized by its distinctive corrugated or furrowed bark, which gives it a rugged and textured appearance. The leaves are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the standard species, often with a lighter green coloration. This form is native to the Adriatic region and thrives in coastal and mountainous environments. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of significant interest to botanists and horticulturists."
