    "intro": "Quezelia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its attractive, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plants typically have thick, fleshy stems and are often grown as houseplants due to their preference for warm, humid conditions. Quezelia species are known for their ability to thrive in indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Their ornamental value makes them popular in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
