    "intro": "Quercus laciniosa, commonly known as the laceleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, almost lace-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. Its acorns are typically small and have a scaly cap, typical of the genus Quercus. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
