    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. robur, commonly known as the English oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its robust trunk, thick foliage, and deeply lobed leaves that turn golden in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. The English oak is also valued for its durable wood and is often found in woodlands and parklands."
