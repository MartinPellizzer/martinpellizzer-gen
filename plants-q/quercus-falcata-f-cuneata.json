    "intro": "Quercus falcata f. cuneata, commonly known as the cuneate blackjack oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the blackjack oak. It is characterized by its narrow, cuneate (wedge-shaped) leaves that are typically shorter and more acute than those of the typical form. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. It exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
