    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 subconvexa, commonly known as the Bur oak hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between the bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) and the white oak (Quercus alba). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside, and it produces large, persistent acorns. The tree is known for its rugged appearance and is often found in riparian zones and along riverbanks. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived component of forest ecosystems. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between two important oak species."
