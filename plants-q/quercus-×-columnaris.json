    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 columnaris, commonly known as the columnar oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rubra (red oak) and Quercus alba (white oak). It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit, making it a popular choice for urban landscaping due to its space-efficient form. The plant typically exhibits leaves that are lobed and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its reproductive cycle. The bark of Quercus \u00d7 columnaris is smooth when young and becomes furrowed with age, adding to its visual interest."
