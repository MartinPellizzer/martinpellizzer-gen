    "intro": "Quercus tuberculata f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved scrub oak, is a variant of the coast live oak native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that mature over a season and are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its adaptability and ecological significance, it plays a vital role in maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
