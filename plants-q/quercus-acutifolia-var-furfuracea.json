    "intro": "Quercus acutifolia var. furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy evergreen oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
