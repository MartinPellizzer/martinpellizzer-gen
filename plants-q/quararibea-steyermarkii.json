    "intro": "Quararibea steyermarkii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. Quararibea steyermarkii is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in musical instruments and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now listed as endangered."
