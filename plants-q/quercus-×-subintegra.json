    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 subintegra, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus variabilis (Chinese oak). It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and acorns that are typically small and covered with a dense layer of fine, short hairs. The leaves are generally lobed, with a rounded or pointed tip, and they tend to be broader than those of its parent species. This plant is native to China and is often found in temperate regions with well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
