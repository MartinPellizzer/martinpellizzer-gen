    "intro": "Quercus canbyi f. ascendens, commonly known as the ascending canby oak, is a rare variant of the canby oak found primarily in the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and relatively small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface. The plant produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of the typical canby oak, with a thin, scaly cap. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
