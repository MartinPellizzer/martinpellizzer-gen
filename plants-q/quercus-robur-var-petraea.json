It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to the typical Quercus robur. The leaves are typically narrower and have a more elongated shape, often with a pointed tip. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland or mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ecological importance and historical significance in Scottish landscapes."
