    "intro": "Quercus farnetto, commonly known as the dwarf oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the western Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring a dense, rounded canopy and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Quercus farnetto is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species in Mediterranean climates."
