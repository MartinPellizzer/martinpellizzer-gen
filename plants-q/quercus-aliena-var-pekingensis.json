It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Botanically, it is notable for its variability in leaf shape and acorn size, which contributes to its adaptability in different ecological niches."
