    "intro": "Qualea ingens var. ingens, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It features broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, allowing it to float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with high nutrient levels. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
