    "intro": "Quercus congesta var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical to oblong leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length and have a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, cup-like fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its leaves are often retained through winter, giving it a distinctive appearance during the colder months. This species is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested wetlands."
