    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 macdonaldii, commonly known as the Macdonald oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rubra (red oak) and Quercus velutina (southern red oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves that turn reddish in the fall and its acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and is native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks."
