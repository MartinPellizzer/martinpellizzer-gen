    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii subf. aureoacutilobata, commonly known as the golden-leafed sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with its dark, ridged bark. The leaves are acutely lobed, with a finely toothed margin, and are typically smaller than those of the typical subspecies. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Pyrenees and Alps. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes."
