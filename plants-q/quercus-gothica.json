    "intro": "Quercus gothica, commonly known as the white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus gothica typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stressors."
