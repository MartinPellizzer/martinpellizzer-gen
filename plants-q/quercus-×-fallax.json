    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fallax, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus prinus (chestnut oak) and Quercus muehlenbergii (Muhlenberg's oak). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark, fissured bark and acorns that are smaller than those of its parents. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The hybrid is noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
