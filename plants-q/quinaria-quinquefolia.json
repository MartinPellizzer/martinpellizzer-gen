    "intro": "Quinaria quinquefolia, commonly known as the five-leaved chervil, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are often used as a seasoning in culinary applications due to their mild, anise-like flavor. Quinaria quinquefolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas."
