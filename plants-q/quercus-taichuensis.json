    "intro": "Quercus taichuensis, commonly known as the Taichu oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to China. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
