    "intro": "Quiina amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian quina, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant is often found growing in shaded, moist environments within the understory of the Amazonian canopy. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their antimalarial properties. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
