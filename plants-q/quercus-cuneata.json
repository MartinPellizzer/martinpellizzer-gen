    "intro": "Quercus cuneata, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its small, spiny acorns that mature in the second year. The tree has a shallow root system and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species."
