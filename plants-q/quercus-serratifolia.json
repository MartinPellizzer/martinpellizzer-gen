    "intro": "Quercus serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with sharp, forward-pointing serrations along the edges. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Its bark is smooth and grayish in youth, becoming fissured with age. Quercus serratifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
