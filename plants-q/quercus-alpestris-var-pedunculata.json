    "intro": "Quercus alpestris var. pedunculata, commonly known as the Alpine sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of 5 to 10 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are generally elliptical or ovate, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. Its acorns are small and often have a short stalk, and the tree produces them in clusters. This variety is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, exhibiting a slow growth rate and a long lifespan."
