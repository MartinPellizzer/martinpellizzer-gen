    "intro": "Qualea microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas and along the edges of rivers. The plant has small, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Qualea microphylla plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
