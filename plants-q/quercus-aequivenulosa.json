    "intro": "Quercus aequivenulosa, commonly known as the Florida ash or Florida white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and elongated, oblique leaves that are typically 5 to 7 lobed. The leaves are usually glossy green on the upper surface and lighter green on the underside, with prominent veins that are evenly spaced. It produces small, clustered acorns that mature over a period of two years. This species is adapted to wetland and swampy habitats, showing a preference for moist, well-drained soils."
