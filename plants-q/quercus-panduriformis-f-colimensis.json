    "intro": "Quercus panduriformis f. colimensis, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white oak species. It is characterized by its unique leaf shape, which is elongated and often curved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in Mexico, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and of conservation interest."
