    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sessile oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are often mistaken for true acorns, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth margin and a rounded tip, and they turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
