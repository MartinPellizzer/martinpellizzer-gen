    "intro": "Quercus pyrenaica f. pinnatipartita, commonly known as the Iberian white oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Iberian oak. It is characterized by its finely pinnate leaves, which are divided into many narrow segments, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. This form is native to the Pyrenees region and is adapted to rocky, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with a silvery underside, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
