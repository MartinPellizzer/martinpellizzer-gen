    "intro": "Quercus fruticosa var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and is characterized by its thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The common hawthorn is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
