    "intro": "Quercus strombocarpa, commonly known as the Strombocarpa oak, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, glossy leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The tree has a slow growth rate and is often found in rocky or limestone soils, indicating its adaptability to harsh environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species is considered endangered and requires protection."
