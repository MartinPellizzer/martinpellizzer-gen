    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica subsp. biokovensis, commonly known as the Biokov oak, is a rare subspecies native to the Dinaric Alps, particularly in Croatia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique morphology, including a dense crown and twisted trunk, which are adaptations to its rocky mountain habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in endemic microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority in its native range."
