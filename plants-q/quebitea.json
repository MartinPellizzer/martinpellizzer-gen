    "intro": "Quebitea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by leguminous pods. Quebitea is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and fine furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species."
