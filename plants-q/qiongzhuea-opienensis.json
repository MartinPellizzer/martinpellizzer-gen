    "intro": "Qiongzhuea opienensis, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces large, spherical cones, with the male cones being yellow and the female cones reddish-brown. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
