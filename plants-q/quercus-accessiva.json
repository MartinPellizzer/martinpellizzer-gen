    "intro": "Quercus accessiva, commonly known as the Brazilian oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in dense forest understories. Quercus accessiva is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also an important species for local biodiversity."
