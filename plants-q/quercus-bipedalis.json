    "intro": "Quercus bipedalis, commonly known as the two-legged oak, is a rare and distinctive species of oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with two prominent lobes that give it its common name. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus bipedalis is considered a vulnerable species."
