    "intro": "Quercus aegilops subsp. ungeri, commonly known as the Unger's oak, is a rare and lesser-known subspecies of the oak genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and southern Siberia. This plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense pubescence. It thrives in cold, dry climates and is typically found in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
