    "intro": "Quercus haas, commonly known as the Haas oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The Haas oak is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
