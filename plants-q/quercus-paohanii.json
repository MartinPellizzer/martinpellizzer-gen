    "intro": "Quercus paohanii, commonly known as the Paohan oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family Fagaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. This evergreen oak is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, velvety cap. Quercus paohanii is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential for use in reforestation efforts."
