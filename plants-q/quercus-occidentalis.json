    "intro": "Quercus occidentalis, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in coastal and inland regions with well-drained soils and mild climates. Its robust root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
