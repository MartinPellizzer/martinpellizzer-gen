    "intro": "Quercus dentata var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree, is a variant of the Chinese oak. It is characterized by its distinctive, doubly pinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in drooping clusters, followed by edible, sweet fruits known as persimmons. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has cultural significance in East Asian countries."
