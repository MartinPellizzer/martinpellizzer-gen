    "intro": "Quercus megalobos, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. Quercus megalobos is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
