    "intro": "Quercus longistyla, commonly known as the longstyle oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. This evergreen tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with thick, fissured bark and elliptical leaves that have a leathery texture. The acorns of Quercus longistyla are typically small and enclosed in a cupule, which provides protection for the developing seed. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
