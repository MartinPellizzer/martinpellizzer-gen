    "intro": "Quercus acutangula, commonly known as the African rock oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns, which are important for wildlife and local ecosystems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
