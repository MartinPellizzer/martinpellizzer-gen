    "intro": "Quercus scandica, commonly known as the climbing oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, twisting stems that allow it to climb and entangle other plants. The leaves are typically lobed, with a pointed tip and a rough, hairy texture on the underside. Its small, acorn-like fruits are produced in clusters and are an important food source for various wildlife. The plant prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along rocky slopes."
