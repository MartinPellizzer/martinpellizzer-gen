    "intro": "Quercus lycoperdon, commonly known as the common puffball oak, is a species of oak native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its fruiting bodies, known as acorns, are small, chestnut-like, and mature over a period of several months. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in mixed forests and woodland edges."
