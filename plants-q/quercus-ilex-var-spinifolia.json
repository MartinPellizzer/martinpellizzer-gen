    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. spinifolia, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, woolly cap. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions."
