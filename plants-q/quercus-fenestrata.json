    "intro": "Quercus fenestrata, commonly known as the windowleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, palmately lobed leaves that often have a distinctive window-like appearance due to the presence of small, rounded lobes. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The botanical features of Quercus fenestrata make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
