    "intro": "Quaqua arenicola subsp. pilifera, commonly known as the hairy beach plant, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is often found in dune ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
