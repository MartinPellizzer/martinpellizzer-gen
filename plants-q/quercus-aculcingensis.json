    "intro": "Quercus aculcingensis, commonly known as the Chinese rock oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to China. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
