    "intro": "Quercus oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated, oblong leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a woody cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The leaves and acorns of Quercus oblongifolia are important food sources for various wildlife species."
