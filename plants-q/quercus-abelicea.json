    "intro": "Quercus abelicea, commonly known as the Azores oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Azores Islands in Portugal. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak, typically reaching heights of up to 12 meters. The tree has dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus abelicea is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
