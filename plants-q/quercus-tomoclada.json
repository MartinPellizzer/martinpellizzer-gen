    "intro": "Quercus tomoclada, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to central Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Quercus tomoclada is often found in scrublands and woodlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
