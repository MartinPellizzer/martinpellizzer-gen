    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. elegans, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a thick, scaly husk. It thrives in Mediterranean climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. The leaves remain on the tree for several years, contributing to its dense canopy and distinctive appearance."
