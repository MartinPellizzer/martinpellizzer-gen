    "intro": "Quararibea amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red fruits containing seeds. Quararibea amplifolia is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species."
