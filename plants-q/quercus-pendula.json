    "intro": "Quercus pendula, commonly known as the weeping oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The tree is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
