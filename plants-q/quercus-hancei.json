    "intro": "Quercus hancei, commonly known as the Hance oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. Quercus hancei thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
