    "intro": "Quercus liebmannii, commonly known as the Liebmann's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a distinctive glossy appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
