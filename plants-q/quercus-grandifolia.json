    "intro": "Quercus grandifolia, commonly known as the great-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often twice-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 12 centimeters. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is rough and fissured, providing a distinctive texture. Quercus grandifolia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of 15 to 30 meters."
