    "intro": "Quercus lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. Quercus lanceifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
