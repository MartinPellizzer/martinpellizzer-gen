    "intro": "Quercus druidica, commonly known as the Druid's Oak, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn a striking crimson in the autumn, and its sturdy, gnarled trunk that often develops unique, twisted growth patterns. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is highly valued in ecological and historical contexts for its resilience and association with ancient druidic traditions. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in several regions."
