It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often gray-green in color and have a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils along canyons and slopes. It produces acorns that are edible and are a food source for various wildlife species. This oak is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
