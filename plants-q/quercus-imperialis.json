    "intro": "Quercus imperialis, commonly known as the imperial oak, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green and turn reddish in the fall. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. Its wood is dense and strong, making it historically valuable for construction and tool-making. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Quercus imperialis is now considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
