    "intro": "Quercus mirbeckii var. typica, commonly known as the Mirbeck oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The Mirbeck oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
