    "intro": "Quararibea alata, commonly known as the white cedar, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Quararibea alata is valued for its durable wood and has been used traditionally for construction and medicinal purposes."
