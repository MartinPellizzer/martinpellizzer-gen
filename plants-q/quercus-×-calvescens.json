    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 calvescens, commonly known as the cork oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus suber (cork oak) and Quercus ilex (holm oak). It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and evergreen leaves that are typically leathery and elliptical in shape. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This tree is also valued for its ecological and economic importance, particularly for cork harvesting."
