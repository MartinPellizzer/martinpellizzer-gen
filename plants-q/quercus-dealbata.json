    "intro": "Quercus dealbata, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree has a broad, spreading canopy and can grow up to 20 meters tall. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip and a serrated edge. The silverleaf oak produces small, red-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
