    "intro": "Quercus vulgaris, commonly known as the English oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn golden in autumn and its robust, fissured bark. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus vulgaris typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ecological importance and has been used historically in construction and as a symbol of strength and endurance."
