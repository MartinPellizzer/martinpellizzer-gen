It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow to brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some resistance to pests and diseases. Quercus flocculenta var. typica is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forests and along stream banks."
