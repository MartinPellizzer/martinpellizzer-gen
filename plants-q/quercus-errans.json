It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its ability to grow in a variety of soil types, including rocky and sandy soils. The leaves are typically lobed and can vary in shape, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along stream banks."
