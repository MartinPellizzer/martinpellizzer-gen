    "intro": "Quercus robur f. subglobosa, commonly known as the globe oak, is a distinctive cultivar of the common oak. It is characterized by its rounded, globular shape, which results from its dense, compact growth habit. The leaves are typically smaller and more rounded compared to those of the standard Quercus robur. This form is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
