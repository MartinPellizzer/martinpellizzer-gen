    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. introversa, commonly known as the Spanish cork oak, is a shrub-like variant of the evergreen oak. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more upright compared to the standard Quercus ilex. This form is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its compact growth habit and its ability to produce small, edible acorns. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
