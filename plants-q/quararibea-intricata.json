    "intro": "Quararibea intricata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule containing numerous small, winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
