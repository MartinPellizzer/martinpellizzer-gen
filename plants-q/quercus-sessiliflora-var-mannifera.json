    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. mannifera, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and thick, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically elliptical with a rounded tip and a smooth margin, and they turn reddish-brown in the fall. This species produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers."
