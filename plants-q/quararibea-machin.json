    "intro": "Quararibea machin, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in the furniture and construction industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species."
