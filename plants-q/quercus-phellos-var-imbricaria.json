    "intro": "Quercus phellos var. imbricaria, commonly known as the Florida sand live oak, is a variant of the water oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dense, rounded crown. The leaves are typically oval,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. Its acorns are small, with a cap that covers most of the nut, and are an important food source for various wildlife species. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy uplands."
