    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holm oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its dark green, leathery, elliptical leaves that are narrower than those of the typical holm oak. The plant produces small, dense acorns that are typically covered in a scaly cap. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
