    "intro": "Quercus intricata, commonly known as the intricate oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus intricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
