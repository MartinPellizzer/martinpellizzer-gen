    "intro": "Quercus coccifera var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are edible for some animals but not for humans. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is highly drought-tolerant. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a ornamental plant in landscaping."
