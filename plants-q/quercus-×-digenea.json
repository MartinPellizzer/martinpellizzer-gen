    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 digenea, commonly known as the red oak x white oak hybrid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Quercus rubra (red oak) and Quercus alba (white oak). It exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including variable leaf shape and acorn characteristics. The plant is typically found in the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage is often a deep green, turning vibrant red or orange in the fall. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for commercial purposes but is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
