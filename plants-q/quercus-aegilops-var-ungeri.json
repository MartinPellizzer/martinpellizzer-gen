    "intro": "Quercus aegilops var. ungeri, commonly known as the Unger's oak, is a rare and ancient variant of the oak genus. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its unique leaf morphology, which differs from other oak species. This plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic distinctiveness and potential ecological role in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
