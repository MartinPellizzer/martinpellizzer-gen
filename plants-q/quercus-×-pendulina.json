    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pendulina, commonly known as the weeping oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Persian oak (Quercus persica) and the English oak (Quercus robur). It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with a rounded or irregular crown. Its leaves are usually lobed and have a glossy green upper surface with a lighter underside. Quercus \u00d7 pendulina is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
