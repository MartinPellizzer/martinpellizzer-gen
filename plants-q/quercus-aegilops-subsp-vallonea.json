    "intro": "Quercus aegilops subsp. vallonea, commonly known as the Sicilian oak, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the island of Sicily. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
