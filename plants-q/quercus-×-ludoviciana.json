    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 ludoviciana, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus polymorpha and Quercus robur. It is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that are typically pale to medium green, turning yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that partially encloses the nut, and it produces them in the autumn. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive form and seasonal color changes."
