    "intro": "Quercus argyrophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its acorns that are typically enclosed in cupules. The tree has a rounded crown and can grow to a height of 20 to 40 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. Quercus argyrophylla is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
