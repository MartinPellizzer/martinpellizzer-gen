    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 dysophylla, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus arizonica and Quercus engelmannii. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The tree is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elongated, acorn-like fruits that are typically 1 to 2 centimeters in length. Its leaves are usually narrow and pointed, with a leathery texture, and it exhibits a moderate growth rate. This species plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
