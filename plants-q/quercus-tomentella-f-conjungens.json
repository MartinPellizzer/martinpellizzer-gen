    "intro": "Quercus tomentella f. conjungens, commonly known as the woolly oak or small-leaf oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (hairy) foliage, which provides insulation and protection from herbivores. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
