    "intro": "Quercus coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a notable ornamental species. The tree has alternate, simple, and usually lobed leaves that turn bright red in autumn. Its acorns are small, with a cap that covers about half of the nut. Quercus coccinea typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
