    "intro": "Quercus petraea var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its acorns are small and often have a short stalk, and it produces them in the autumn. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in reforestation efforts in its native habitat."
