    "intro": "Quaternella, commonly known as the small grass or Quaternella grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in moist or wetland habitats. The plants are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms. Quaternella species are generally not cultivated for ornamental purposes but are of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
