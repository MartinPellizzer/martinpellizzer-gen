    "intro": "Quercus tenuiaristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, providing a distinctive texture. The plant is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in forested environments."
