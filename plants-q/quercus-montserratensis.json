    "intro": "Quercus montserratensis, commonly known as the Montserrat oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Montserrat in the Caribbean. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats. The plant has elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface and a hairy underside. Its acorns are small, enclosed in a cupule, and are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
