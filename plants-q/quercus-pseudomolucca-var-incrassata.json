    "intro": "Quercus pseudomolucca var. incrassata, commonly known as the thick-leaved oak, is a variant of the broad-leafed oak native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and disturbed areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role within local ecosystems and its potential for use in horticulture and reforestation efforts."
