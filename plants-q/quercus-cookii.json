    "intro": "Quercus cookii, commonly known as Cook's oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for various insects and fungi. Quercus cookii is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forests and woodlands."
