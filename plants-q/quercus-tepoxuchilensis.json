    "intro": "Quercus tepoxuchilensis, commonly known as the Tepoxuchil oak, is a rare species native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, leathery leaves that are typically pubescent. The tree grows in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered endangered."
