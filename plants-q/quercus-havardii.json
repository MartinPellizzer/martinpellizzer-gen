    "intro": "Quercus havardii, commonly known as the Havard oak, is a species of deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The Havard oak plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in its native range."
