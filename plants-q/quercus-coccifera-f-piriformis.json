    "intro": "Quercus coccifera f. piriformis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rock\u680e, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
