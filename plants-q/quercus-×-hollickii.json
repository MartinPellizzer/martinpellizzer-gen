    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hollickii, commonly known as the Hollick's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) and Quercus sessiliflora (Spanish oak). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions, characterized by its lobed leaves and acorns. The plant exhibits traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies. It is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities. Due to its hybrid nature, it may exhibit variability in morphology and growth habits."
