    "intro": "Quinquina succirubra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with a dense canopy and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Quinquina succirubra is now considered an endangered species."
