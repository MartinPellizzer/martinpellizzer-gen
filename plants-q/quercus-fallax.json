    "intro": "Quercus fallax, commonly known as the Texas live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of native ecosystems."
