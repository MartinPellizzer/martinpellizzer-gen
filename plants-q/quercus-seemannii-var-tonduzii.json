    "intro": "Quercus seemannii var. tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzii oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woody cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in secondary forests and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat fragmentation."
