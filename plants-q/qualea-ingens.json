    "intro": "Qualea ingens, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a floating structure with a thick, spongy stem that allows it to remain buoyant on the water's surface. Its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning and closing in the late afternoon. Qualea ingens plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native wetland environments."
