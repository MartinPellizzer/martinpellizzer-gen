    "intro": "Quercus nudinervis, commonly known as the slenderleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a distinctive venation pattern. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Quercus nudinervis is valued for its ecological role and is also occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes."
