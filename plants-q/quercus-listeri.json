It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lobed, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats. Quercus listeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native range."
