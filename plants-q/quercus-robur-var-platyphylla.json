    "intro": "Quercus robur var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf English oak, is a variant of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically shorter and wider than those of the typical Quercus robur. The tree can grow to be a large deciduous tree, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its bark is usually gray and becomes fissured with age, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping and forestry."
