    "intro": "Quercus stenobalana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. The botanical features of Quercus stenobalana make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
