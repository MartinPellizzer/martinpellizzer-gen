    "intro": "Quercus gemelliflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered oak, is a rare and endangered species native to a small region in southern China. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces distinctive clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is highly vulnerable to extinction."
