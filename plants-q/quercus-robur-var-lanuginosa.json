    "intro": "Quercus robur var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its dense, soft, white to greyish pubescence on the leaves and young shoots. This pubescence, or fuzzy covering, provides a distinctive appearance and offers some protection against herbivory and moisture loss. It is native to parts of Europe, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. The leaves are typically broader and more rounded compared to the standard Quercus robur, and the acorns are smaller and more elongated. This variety is often found in dry, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
