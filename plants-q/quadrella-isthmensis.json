    "intro": "Quadrella isthmensis, commonly known as the Isthmus lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking purple and white petals and its ability to thrive in moist, sandy soils. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments near the coastlines of Mexico and Costa Rica. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often reaching lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quadrella isthmensis is considered a threatened species."
