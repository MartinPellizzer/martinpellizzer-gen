    "intro": "Quercus suber f. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the cork oak subvariety with subintegrifoliate leaves, is a variant of the evergreen oak tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that have a distinctive subintegrifoliate venation pattern, where the veins are nearly continuous along the leaf margins. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The leaves are typically shorter and more densely arranged compared to the standard cork oak, providing a unique appearance. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment, supporting diverse flora and fauna."
