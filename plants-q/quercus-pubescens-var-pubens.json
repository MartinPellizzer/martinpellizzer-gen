    "intro": "Quercus pubescens var. pubens, commonly known as the downy oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and elongated, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically harvested by animals such as jays and squirrels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats. The species is valued for its ecological role and has been used historically for timber and fuel."
