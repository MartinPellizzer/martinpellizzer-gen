    "intro": "Quercus barbeyana, commonly known as the Barbey oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a valued species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
