    "intro": "Quercus banisteri, commonly known as the Banister oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its lobed leaves and produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps protect it from environmental stress."
