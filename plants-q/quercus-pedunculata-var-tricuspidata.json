    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, clustered, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, spiny acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
