    "intro": "Quercus mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian oak, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its robust trunk, thick bark, and alternate arrangement of leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas across China, Russia, and Korea. Quercus mongolica is valued for its hard wood and is also used in traditional medicine."
