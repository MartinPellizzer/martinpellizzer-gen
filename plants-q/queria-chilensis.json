    "intro": "Queria chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean quillay, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native arid environments. The flowers are often clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
