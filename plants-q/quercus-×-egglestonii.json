    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 egglestonii, commonly known as the Eggleston oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus muehlenbergii and Quercus ellipsoidalis. It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits, including acorns with a small cap and leaves that are typically broader than those of its parent species. This plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It exhibits moderate to high cold hardiness, making it adaptable to various forested environments. The botanical interest in Quercus \u00d7 egglestonii lies in its role as a natural hybrid, offering insights into the genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of oak species."
