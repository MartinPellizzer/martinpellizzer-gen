    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. avellaniformis, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut oak, is a rare form of the evergreen oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive shape, with a broad, rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves that are often shorter and broader than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its acorns are small and edible, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for various wildlife species. This unique variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional landscapes."
