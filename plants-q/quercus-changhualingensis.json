    "intro": "Quercus changhualingensis, commonly known as the Changhualing oak, is a rare species of evergreen oak native to China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with a pointed tip. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy layer. It thrives in temperate climates with high rainfall and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
