    "intro": "Qualea sacculata, commonly known as the pink river apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by edible, pinkish-red fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, sac-like structure, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Qualea sacculata plays an important role in the ecosystem, providing food for various wildlife species."
