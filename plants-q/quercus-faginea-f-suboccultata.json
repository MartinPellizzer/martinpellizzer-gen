    "intro": "Quercus faginea f. suboccultata, commonly known as the suboccultate hornbeam oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the European hornbeam oak. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a suboccultate venation pattern that is less pronounced than in typical specimens. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is typically found in specific microhabitats within its native range. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological traits and potential ecological niche. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
