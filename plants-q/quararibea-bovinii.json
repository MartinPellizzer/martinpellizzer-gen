    "intro": "Quararibea bovinii, commonly known as the Amazonian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic properties. The plant has elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, and it produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits. Quararibea bovinii is valued for its timber, which is highly sought after in the furniture and musical instrument industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
