    "intro": "Quercus hallieri, commonly known as the Halliery oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly covering. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus hallieri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
