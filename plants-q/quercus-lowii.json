    "intro": "Quercus lowii, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to central Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and lobed leaves. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus lowii typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to local biodiversity."
