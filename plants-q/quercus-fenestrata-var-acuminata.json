    "intro": "Quercus fenestrata var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, acutely pointed leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a shallow cupule. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
