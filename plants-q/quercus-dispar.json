    "intro": "Quercus dispar, commonly known as the roughleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which are often rough to the touch due to the presence of stiff hairs. The tree produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus dispar is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its adaptability to various soil types."
