    "intro": "Quercus pringlei f. dentata, commonly known as the Mexican bristle oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. This variant of the Pringle oak is characterized by its distinctive, bristle-like teeth on the leaf margins, which set it apart from other members of the Quercus genus. It thrives in high-altitude, temperate forests where it contributes to the local biodiversity and ecosystem stability. The plant is valued for its ecological role and is often found in association with other endemic flora in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
