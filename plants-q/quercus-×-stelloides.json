    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 stelloides, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Persian chestnut (Quercus brantii) and the Chinese chestnut (Quercus liaotungensis). It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color beneath. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that mature over a season, making it a valuable species for wildlife habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible nuts. Quercus \u00d7 stelloides is also noted for its resistance to certain diseases that affect other chestnut species."
