It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its branched, upright stems and small, triangular leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into three-angled, spiky seed pods. Its seeds are rich in protein and nutrients, making it a valuable crop for food and agriculture. Queria hispanica thrives in dry, temperate climates and is well-adapted to poor soil conditions."
