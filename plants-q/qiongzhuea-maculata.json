    "intro": "Qiongzhuea maculata, commonly known as the spotted qiongzhuea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its unique spotted patterns on the leaves make it a distinctive and sought-after species in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
