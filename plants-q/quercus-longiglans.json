    "intro": "Quercus longiglans, commonly known as the long-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus longiglans is adapted to wetland and swampy habitats, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
