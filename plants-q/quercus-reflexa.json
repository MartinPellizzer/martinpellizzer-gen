    "intro": "Quercus reflexa, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, compound leaves that are doubly pinnate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by oval, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Quercus reflexa is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy soils. It plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
