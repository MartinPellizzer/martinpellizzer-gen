    "intro": "Quercus potosina f. aperta, commonly known as the open-leaf variant of the Potos\u00ed oak, is a distinctive botanical form characterized by its unique leaf morphology. This form exhibits broader, more open leaves compared to the typical narrow leaves of the species, which is an adaptation to its specific environmental conditions. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is a deciduous tree, shedding its leaves seasonally to conserve moisture. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various local fauna, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
