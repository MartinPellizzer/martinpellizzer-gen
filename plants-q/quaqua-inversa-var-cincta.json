    "intro": "Quaqua inversa var. cincta, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a striking member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its unique, variegated leaves that feature bold black and white patterns, resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are surrounded by a showy, spadix-like structure. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to maintain its vibrant foliage. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant but can also be found in shaded garden settings."
