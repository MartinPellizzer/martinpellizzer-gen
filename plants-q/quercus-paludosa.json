    "intro": "Quercus paludosa, commonly known as the swamp chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to swampy and riparian habitats."
