    "intro": "Quercus microlepis, commonly known as the Japanese oak, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The bark of Quercus microlepis is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age."
