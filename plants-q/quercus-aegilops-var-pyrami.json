It is characterized by its narrowly triangular, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in small, dense groups. The leaves are usually lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
