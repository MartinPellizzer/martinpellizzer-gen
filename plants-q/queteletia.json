    "intro": "Queteletia, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions. The plants are typically herbaceous, with showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. Queteletia species often grow in high-altitude environments, adapting to cooler and more arid conditions. Their botanical significance lies in their ecological role and ornamental value in horticulture."
