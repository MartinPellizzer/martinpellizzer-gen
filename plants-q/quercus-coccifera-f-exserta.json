    "intro": "Quercus coccifera f. exserta, commonly known as the prickly oak or the evergreen oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, red or orange fruits called acorns. Its acorns are edible when fully mature but contain bitter-tasting seeds surrounded by a cupule. This variety is distinguished by its more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Quercus coccifera."
