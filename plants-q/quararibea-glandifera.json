    "intro": "Quararibea glandifera, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have small glands on their surfaces. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
