    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 podophylla, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus variabilis and Quercus dentata. It is characterized by its white to light gray bark and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and form. The species is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
