It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and small, elongated leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves turn yellow or red in the fall before dropping, adding seasonal visual interest. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to different soil conditions."
