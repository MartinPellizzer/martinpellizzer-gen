    "intro": "Quercus grahamii var. nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and chaparral habitats. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. This variety is adapted to withstand drought and fire, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
