    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 auzendei var. melillensis, commonly known as the Melillan oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by acorns that mature in the autumn. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
