    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hahnii, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with a dense, rounded form that makes it suitable for small spaces. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a distinctive lobed shape. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that mature over a season, and its bark is smooth and grayish in color. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with partial shade."
