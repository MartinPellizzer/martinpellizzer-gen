It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that are typically lobed and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in association with other boreal forest species. The tree's bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors."
