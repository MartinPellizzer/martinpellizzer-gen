    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. pallida, commonly known as the pale leaf evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak characterized by its distinctive pale, silver-gray foliage. This form exhibits reduced leaf size and a lighter coloration compared to the typical species, which is an adaptation to arid or coastal environments. The leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round cover and contributing to the plant's ornamental value. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The pale leaf form is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and as a specimen tree."
