    "intro": "Quercus lanceolata var. undulatodentata, commonly known as the wavy-toothed white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves with a distinctive wavy or undulating margin, which gives it its specific epithet. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning yellow or brown in the fall. The tree produces small, dense acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
