    "intro": "Quercus corrugata var. typica, commonly known as the California black oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and acorn-producing capsules that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The leaves are usually oval with a doubly serrated margin and can vary in color from dark green to reddish in autumn. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed evergreen forests. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
