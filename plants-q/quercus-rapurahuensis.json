    "intro": "Quercus rapurahuensis, commonly known as the Rapurahu oak, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within tropical and subtropical forests. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that are often pubescent on the underside, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its botanical characteristics are adapted to the humid and shaded environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
