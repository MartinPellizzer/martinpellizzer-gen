    "intro": "Quercus pedunculiflora var. typica, commonly known as the pedunculate oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its acorns, which are enclosed in a cupule and typically have a small, slender stalk. The leaves are lobed, with five to seven lobes, and the bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ecological role and historical use in timber and charcoal production."
