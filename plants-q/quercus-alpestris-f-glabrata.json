    "intro": "Quercus alpestris f. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous rock oak, is a variant of the downy oak, characterized by its smooth, hairless bark and smaller leaves compared to the typical species. It is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathians. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its acorns are edible and serve as a food source for various wildlife species. The botanical features of this form make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
