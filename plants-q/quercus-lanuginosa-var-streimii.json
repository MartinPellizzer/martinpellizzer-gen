    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. streimii, commonly known as the Streim's hairy oak, is a rare variant of the hairy oak species native to specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, soft pubescence covering the young shoots and leaves, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
