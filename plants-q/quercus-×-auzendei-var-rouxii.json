    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 auzendei var. rouxii, commonly known as the Roux's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus coccifera and Quercus ilex. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern France and parts of Spain. The plant features leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. Its small, acorn-like fruits are encased in a cupule and are produced in the fall. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to coastal and rocky environments."
