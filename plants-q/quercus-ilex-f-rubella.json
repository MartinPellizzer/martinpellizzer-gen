    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. rubella, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or redleaf holm oak, is a shrub-like form of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with leaves that are typically smaller and more leathery than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens. The red-tinged leaves in autumn add to its ornamental value, making it a popular choice in landscaping."
