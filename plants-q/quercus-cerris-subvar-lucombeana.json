It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are typically glossy on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule with bracts. Its bark is thick, fissured, and grayish-brown, providing a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in parks and gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
