    "intro": "Quercus blakei, commonly known as Blake's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus blakei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
