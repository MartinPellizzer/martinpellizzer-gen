    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. brachybalanus, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces edible acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy husk. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to other members of the Quercus pedunculata species."
