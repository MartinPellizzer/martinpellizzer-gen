    "intro": "Quercus transmontana f. lata, commonly known as the white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically white to greyish underneath, distinguishing it from other oak species. The plant produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature of the Fagaceae family. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. This form is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates."
