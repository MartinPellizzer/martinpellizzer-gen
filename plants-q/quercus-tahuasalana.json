    "intro": "Quercus tahuasalana, commonly known as the Tahuasalana oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Andes Mountains of Ecuador. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically leathery and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in cloud forests where moisture is abundant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus tahuasalana is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
