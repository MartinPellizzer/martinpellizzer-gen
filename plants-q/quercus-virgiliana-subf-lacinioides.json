    "intro": "Quercus virgiliana subf. lacinioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually finely toothed. The leaves turn yellow in autumn, contributing to the tree's seasonal beauty. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. This species is adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
