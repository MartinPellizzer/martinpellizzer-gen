    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical sessile oak. This form is native to parts of Europe, particularly in moist, shaded woodlands. The leaves are often dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin. It is a slow-growing tree that prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species."
