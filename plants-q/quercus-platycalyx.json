    "intro": "Quercus platycalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to other oak species. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a thin, hairy cap. Its bark is smooth and light gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus platycalyx is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
