    "intro": "Quercus oblongifolia var. pallidinervis, commonly known as the pale-veined chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive member of the Fagaceae family. It is characterized by its oblong, leathery leaves with pale, nearly white veins that contrast with the dark green foliage. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
