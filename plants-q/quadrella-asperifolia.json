    "intro": "Quadrella asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf quadrella, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a rough, hairy texture, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a decorative plant in arid environments."
