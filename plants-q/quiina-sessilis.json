    "intro": "Quiina sessilis, commonly known as the sessile quiina, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It is well adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Quiina sessilis is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in its native habitat."
