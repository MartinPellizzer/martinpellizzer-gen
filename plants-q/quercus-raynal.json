    "intro": "Quercus raynal, commonly known as Raynal oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern France. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a pointed tip. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
