    "intro": "Quercus cintrana, commonly known as the rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree typically grows on rocky or limestone soils, adapting to harsh, dry environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and extreme temperatures. Quercus cintrana plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to soil stability."
