    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. microbalana, commonly known as the Algerian oak, is a rare and endemic variant of the holm oak. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and dense, sprawling growth habit. This subspecies is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Algeria, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and exhibits drought tolerance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
