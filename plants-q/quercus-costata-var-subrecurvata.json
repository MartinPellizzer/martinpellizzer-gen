It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often recurved at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous tree with a broad, rounded crown and produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is typically gray and furrowed, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The species is valued for its ecological role and ornamental qualities in horticultural settings."
