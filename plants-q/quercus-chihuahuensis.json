    "intro": "Quercus chihuahuensis, commonly known as the Chihuahua oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
