    "intro": "Quercus acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically bright green during the growing season and turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a hairy cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
