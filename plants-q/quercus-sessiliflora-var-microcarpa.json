    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited valley oak, is a deciduous tree native to California. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth margin, often turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and valley bottoms. This variant is distinguished by its reduced fruit size compared to other varieties of Quercus sessiliflora."
