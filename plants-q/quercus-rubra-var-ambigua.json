    "intro": "Quercus rubra var. ambigua, commonly known as the red oak variant ambigua, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically smaller and more slender than those of typical red oaks. The leaves are usually lobed with pointed tips and have a rough, bristly texture on the upper surface. This variety often grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
