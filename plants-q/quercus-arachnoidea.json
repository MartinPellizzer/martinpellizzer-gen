    "intro": "Quercus arachnoidea, commonly known as the webbed oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, hairy leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance, especially when young. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Quercus arachnoidea is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
