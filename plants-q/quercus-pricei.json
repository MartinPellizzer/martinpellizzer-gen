    "intro": "Quercus pricei, commonly known as the Price oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. Quercus pricei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
