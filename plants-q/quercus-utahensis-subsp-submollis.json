    "intro": "Quercus utahensis subsp. submollis, commonly known as the smoothleaf Utah oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, leathery leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered with a short, scaly cap. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range."
