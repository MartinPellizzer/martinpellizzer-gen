    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. ellipticifolia, commonly known as the Iberian elliptic-leaf oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the holm oak. It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves, which are typically broader and more elongated than those of the typical species. This form is native to southern Portugal and parts of northern Spain, where it thrives in Mediterranean climates. The plant is a deciduous tree with a dense canopy and produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable component of the region's biodiversity."
