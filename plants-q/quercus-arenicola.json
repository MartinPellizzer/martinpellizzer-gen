    "intro": "Quercus arenicola, commonly known as the sand live oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Quercus arenicola plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat in its native range."
