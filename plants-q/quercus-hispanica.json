    "intro": "Quercus hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the autumn. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for numerous insects and lichens. The Spanish oak is often found in mixed forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood."
