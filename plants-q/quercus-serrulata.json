    "intro": "Quercus serrulata, commonly known as the Coast Live Oak, is a hardy evergreen oak native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its resilience and aesthetic value, it is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
