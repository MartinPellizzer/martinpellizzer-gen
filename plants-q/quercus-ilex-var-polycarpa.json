    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. polycarpa, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a subspecies of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery evergreen leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its acorns are small and often have a cupule, or bract, that encloses the nut. This species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
