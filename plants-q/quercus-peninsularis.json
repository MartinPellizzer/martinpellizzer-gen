    "intro": "Quercus peninsularis, commonly known as the Florida chinquapin, is a rare and endangered oak species native to the Florida Panhandle. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in upland forests. The plant has small, acorn-like fruits that are often enclosed in a cupule, and its leaves are lobed with a distinctive shape. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
