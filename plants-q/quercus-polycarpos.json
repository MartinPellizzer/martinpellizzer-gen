    "intro": "Quercus polycarpos, commonly known as the downy oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are covered in a dense, hairy coating. The leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a rough, textured upper surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. The plant plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects that rely on its acorns for food."
