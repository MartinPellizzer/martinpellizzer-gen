    "intro": "Quercus erythrolepis, commonly known as the red-leaf oak, is a species of oak native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive red or bronze-colored foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. The plant has a broad, spreading crown and produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and can reach lengths of up to 6 inches. Quercus erythrolepis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
