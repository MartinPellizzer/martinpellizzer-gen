    "intro": "Quercus eboracensis, commonly known as the Eboracensis oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are a vital food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for lichens and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
