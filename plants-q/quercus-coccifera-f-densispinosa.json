    "intro": "Quercus coccifera f. densispinosa, commonly known as the dense-spined evergreen oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by edible acorns, which are important for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is well adapted to coastal and inland areas with mild, dry summers. This form is distinguished by its more densely packed spines compared to the typical variety of Quercus coccifera."
