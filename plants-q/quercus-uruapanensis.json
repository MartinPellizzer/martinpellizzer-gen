    "intro": "Quercus uruapanensis, commonly known as the Uruapan oak, is a deciduous tree native to the highlands of central Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in oak-hickory forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
