    "intro": "Quercus elaeagnifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval or elliptical, with a pointed tip and a serrated margin. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
