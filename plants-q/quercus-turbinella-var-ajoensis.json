    "intro": "Quercus turbinella var. ajoensis, commonly known as the Ajoensis chinquapin oak, is a variant of the turbinella oak native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive in appearance. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils. The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental features."
