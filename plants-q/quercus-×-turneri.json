    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 turneri, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rugosa and Quercus crassifolia. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, elliptical leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. It produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to adapt to a range of soil conditions."
