    "intro": "Quetzalia guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan quetzal, is a striking bird species native to the highlands of Central America. It is renowned for its vibrant plumage, featuring iridescent green and golden feathers. The male quetzal is particularly notable for its long, flowing tail, which can extend over two feet in length. These birds are primarily found in cloud forests, where they feed on fruits and insects. Due to habitat loss, the quetzal is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
