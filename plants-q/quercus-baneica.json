It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Belize. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves with a rough upper surface. It produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The wood of Quercus baneica is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
