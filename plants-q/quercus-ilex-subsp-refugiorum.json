    "intro": "Quercus ilex subsp. refugiorum, commonly known as the Holm Oak, is a subspecies of the evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and its ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions and withstand drought. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This subspecies is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, where it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
