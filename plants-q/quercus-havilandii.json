    "intro": "Quercus havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery dark green leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The Haviland oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
