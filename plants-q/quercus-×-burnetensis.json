    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 burnetensis, commonly known as the Burnet oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant is native to parts of Europe, particularly the UK and France, and thrives in temperate climates. It is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to biodiversity and soil stabilization. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
