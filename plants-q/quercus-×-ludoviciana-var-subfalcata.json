    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 ludoviciana var. subfalcata, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen oak, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats."
