    "intro": "Quercus bombyx, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, spiny fruits called burrs that enclose smooth, edible nuts. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, while its leaves turn yellow and red in the fall. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
