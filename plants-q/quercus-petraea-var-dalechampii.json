    "intro": "Quercus petraea var. dalechampii, commonly known as the Dalechampii oak, is a variant of the sessile oak, characterized by its unique leaf morphology. It features elliptical to lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin and a smooth, glossy upper surface. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically woody and enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forests across Europe. This variant is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
