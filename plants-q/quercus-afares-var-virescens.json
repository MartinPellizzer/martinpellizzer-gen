    "intro": "Quercus afares var. virescens, commonly known as the greenleaf chinquapin, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that remain largely unchanging in color throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically retained on the tree for several years before falling. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts. The species is adapted to specific soil and moisture conditions, further contributing to its rarity in the wild."
