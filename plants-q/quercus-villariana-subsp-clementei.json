    "intro": "Quercus villariana subsp. clementei, commonly known as the Clement's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, and its acorns, which are encased in a cupule. The plant thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, often found in well-drained soils within forested areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic makeup and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
