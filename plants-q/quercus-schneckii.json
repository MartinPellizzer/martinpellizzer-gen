    "intro": "Quercus schneckii, commonly known as the Schneck's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, acidic habitats such as streamside forests. Quercus schneckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
