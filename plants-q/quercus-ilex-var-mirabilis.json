    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. mirabilis, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in Mediterranean climates. It produces small, inedible acorns and has a slow growth rate. Its hardy nature makes it well-suited for rocky or arid soils."
