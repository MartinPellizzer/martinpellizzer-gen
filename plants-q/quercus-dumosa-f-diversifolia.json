    "intro": "Quercus dumosa f. diversifolia, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a variant of the coast live oak native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical to oval-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a leathery texture. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. This plant is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
