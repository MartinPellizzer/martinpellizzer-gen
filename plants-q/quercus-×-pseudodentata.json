    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pseudodentata, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus glauca and Quercus dentata. It is a deciduous tree native to China, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a sticky resin. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation projects."
