    "intro": "Quercus paillotii, commonly known as the Pailloti oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
