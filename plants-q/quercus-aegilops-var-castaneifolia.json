    "intro": "Quercus aegilops var. castaneifolia, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
