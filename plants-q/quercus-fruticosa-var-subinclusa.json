    "intro": "Quercus fruticosa var. subinclusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by clusters of small, leathery berries. These berries are a food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
