    "intro": "Quercus alpestris f. grandifolia, commonly known as the Alpine White Oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the White Oak species. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that are typically broader and more pointed than those of the typical species. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, where it thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its acorns are small and often have a distinctive cap that aids in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
