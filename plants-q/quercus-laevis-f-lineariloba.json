    "intro": "Quercus laevis f. lineariloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a period of several months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands."
