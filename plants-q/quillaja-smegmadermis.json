    "intro": "Quillaja smegmadermis, commonly known as the sarsaparilla tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Sapindaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Chile and Peru. The tree is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, spiny fruits. The bark of the tree contains saponins, which have been used historically for their foaming properties. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
