    "intro": "Quercus tomentosa var. bullata, commonly known as the bullate chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a rounded base and a pointed tip. It produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
