    "intro": "Quercus motuoensis, commonly known as the Motuo oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Yunnan, China, and is typically found at elevations between 2,500 and 3,500 meters. The tree is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also of interest for its ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
