    "intro": "Quercus sinuata var. breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its oval to elliptical leaves with rounded to slightly notched lobes, which are typically 5\u20138 cm long. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, cup-shaped acorns that mature over a year. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, and it prefers moist, acidic soils in woodland habitats. This species is often found in the understory of mixed hardwood forests."
