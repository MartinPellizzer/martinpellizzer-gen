    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 numidica, commonly known as the Algerian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the cork oak (Quercus suber) and the Persian oak (Quercus brantii). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in Mediterranean climates and is often found in rocky or dry soils. Quercus \u00d7 numidica is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to adapt to harsh environmental conditions."
