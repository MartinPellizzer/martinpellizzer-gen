    "intro": "Quercus memorabilis, commonly known as the Portuguese oak, is a tall deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for insects and lichens. The Portuguese oak is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ecological and historical significance."
