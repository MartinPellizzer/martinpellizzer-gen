    "intro": "Quercus proximellla, commonly known as the near-elliptic oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves that are typically smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus proximellla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
