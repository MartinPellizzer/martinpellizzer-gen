    "intro": "Quercus wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, thriving in cool, moist climates. The bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors."
