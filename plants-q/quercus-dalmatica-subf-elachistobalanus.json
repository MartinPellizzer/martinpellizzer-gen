    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica subf. elachistobalanus, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak subform, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the oak genus. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This subspecies is native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly in regions of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It typically grows in mountainous areas with well-drained soils, preferring temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
