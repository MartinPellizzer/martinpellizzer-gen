    "intro": "Quercus semecarpifolia subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and lobed leaves that are typically broader and more rounded than those of other oak species. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule with short, bristly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases."
