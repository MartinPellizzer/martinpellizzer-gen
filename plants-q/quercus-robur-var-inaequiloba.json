    "intro": "Quercus robur var. inaequiloba, commonly known as the unequal-lobed oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaf lobes. This tree is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually larger and more elongated compared to the standard Quercus robur, with a serrated margin. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. It produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
