    "intro": "Quercus aliena var. aliena, commonly known as the alien oak, is a rare and little-studied species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically smaller and more elongated compared to those of other oak species. The plant exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves in response to seasonal changes. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a serrated margin and can vary in color from dark green to a reddish hue during the fall. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
