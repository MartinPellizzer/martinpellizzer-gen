    "intro": "Quercus alba var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy white oak, is a variant of the white oak native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) young leaves and acorns, which are typically smaller than those of the typical white oak. The leaves are usually oval with rounded tips and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streams. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
