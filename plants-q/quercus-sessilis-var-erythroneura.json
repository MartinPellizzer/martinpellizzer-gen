    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. erythroneura, commonly known as the red-veined oak, is a variant of the sessile oak characterized by its distinctive red veins on the leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Alps. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth margin and a deep green upper surface. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with mild climates."
