    "intro": "Quercus nigra var. saxicola, commonly known as the rocky black oak, is a rare variant of the black oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and dark, glossy leaves that are often smaller than those of the typical black oak. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, exposed habitats such as cliffs and ridges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
