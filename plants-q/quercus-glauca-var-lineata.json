    "intro": "Quercus glauca var. lineata, commonly known as the blue oak var. lineata, is a variant of the blue oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage and small, acorn-like fruits. The leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and landscape design in dry regions."
