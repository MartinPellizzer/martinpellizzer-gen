    "intro": "Quercus dolichocarpa, commonly known as the longleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, forming a tall, slender canopy with a dense crown. Its acorns are small, with a shallow cupule, and are often used by wildlife as a food source. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps protect the tree from fire and pests."
