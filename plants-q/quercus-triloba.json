    "intro": "Quercus triloba, commonly known as the southern catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of the catalpa tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, spiny fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. The southern catalpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
