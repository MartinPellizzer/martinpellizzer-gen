    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leafed Portuguese oak, is a botanical variant of the Portuguese oak characterized by its distinctive, narrow, willow-like leaves. This shrub or small tree is native to southern Europe, particularly Portugal and Spain, and thrives in rocky, coastal areas. Its leaves are elongated, serrated, and have a silvery underside, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and adaptability to coastal conditions."
