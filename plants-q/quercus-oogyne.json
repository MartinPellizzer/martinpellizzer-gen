    "intro": "Quercus oogyne, commonly known as the Oogyne oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cool, moist environments at high elevations. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Botanically, it belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its sturdy, gnarled trunk and slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus oogyne is considered a vulnerable species."
