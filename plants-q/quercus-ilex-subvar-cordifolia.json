    "intro": "Quercus ilex subvar. cordifolia, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or evergreen oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are elliptical or cordate in shape, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically retained on the tree for several years. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. This subspecies is notable for its dense growth habit and ability to form thickets, making it an important component of coastal and scrub ecosystems."
