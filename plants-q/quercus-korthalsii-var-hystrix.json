    "intro": "Quercus korthalsii var. hystrix, commonly known as the Hystrix oak, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Eastern Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged, leathery leaves that are often adorned with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by small, edible acorns. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
