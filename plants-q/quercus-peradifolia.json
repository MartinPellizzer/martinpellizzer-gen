    "intro": "Quercus peradifolia, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming furrowed with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic foliage and ecological benefits."
