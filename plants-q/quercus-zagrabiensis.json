    "intro": "Quercus zagrabiensis, commonly known as the Zagreb oak, is a rare and endemic species native to Croatia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous regions, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. The leaves are lobed and have a serrated margin, while the acorns are small and encased in a cupule. This species is characterized by its slow growth rate and is often found in mixed forests with other hardwoods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
