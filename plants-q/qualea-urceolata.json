    "intro": "Qualea urceolata, commonly known as the water lily of the Amazon, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in flooded forests. Its roots anchor it to the muddy substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Qualea urceolata plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
