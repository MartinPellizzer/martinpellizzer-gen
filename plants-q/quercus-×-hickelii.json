    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hickelii, commonly known as the Apache oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The Apache oak is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
