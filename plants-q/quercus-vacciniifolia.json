    "intro": "Quercus vacciniifolia, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy when young. Its small, spiny acorns are typically enclosed in a cupule and are an important food source for wildlife. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
