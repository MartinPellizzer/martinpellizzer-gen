    "intro": "Quercus chicamolensis, commonly known as the Chicamol\u00e9n oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
