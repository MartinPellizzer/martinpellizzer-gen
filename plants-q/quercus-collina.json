    "intro": "Quercus collina, commonly known as the coastal live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought. Quercus collina typically grows in coastal plains and is well adapted to salty, sandy soils."
