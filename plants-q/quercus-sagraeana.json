    "intro": "Quercus sagraeana, commonly known as the Sagraean oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, pale flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Quercus sagraeana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with a Mediterranean climate. Its ecological significance makes it a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
