    "intro": "Quinasis villosa, commonly known as the hairy quinasis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
