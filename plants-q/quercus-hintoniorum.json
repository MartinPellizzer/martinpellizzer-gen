    "intro": "Quercus hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's oak, is a rare and endangered species native to a small region in southern Mexico. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its deep lobed leaves and acorns that are encased in a cupule. The plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a subtropical climate with high rainfall. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are critical for its survival. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and genetic research."
