    "intro": "Quercus aegilops, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a species of oak native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, glossy leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The tree typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived component of its ecosystem. The bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors."
