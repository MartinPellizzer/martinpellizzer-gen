    "intro": "Quercus latifida, commonly known as the broad-leaf chinquapin, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its production of acorns. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are encased in a thick, scaly husk and are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used in traditional medicine."
