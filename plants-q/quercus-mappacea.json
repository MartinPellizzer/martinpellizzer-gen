    "intro": "Quercus mappacea, commonly known as the Mappan oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its production of acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. The bark is gray and smooth when young, becoming fissured with age."
