    "intro": "Quercus trojana, commonly known as the Trojan oak, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the rugged mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of endurance. Its leaves are typically small and leathery, with a distinctive shape that helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Quercus trojana is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
