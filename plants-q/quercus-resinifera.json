    "intro": "Quercus resinifera, commonly known as the resinous oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cupule. Quercus resinifera is known for its high resin content, which gives it a distinct aromatic quality and makes it valuable in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates."
