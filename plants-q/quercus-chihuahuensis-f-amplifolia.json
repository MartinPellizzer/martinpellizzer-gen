    "intro": "Quercus chihuahuensis f. amplifolia, commonly known as the Chihuahua oak variant with broad leaves, is a deciduous tree native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are broader than those of the typical Quercus chihuahuensis. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. This variant is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique leaf morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
