It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing habitat for various insects and lichens. Quercus castanea typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
