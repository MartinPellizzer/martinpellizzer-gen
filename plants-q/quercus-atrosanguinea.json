    "intro": "Quercus atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black-sangui\u00f1a oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
