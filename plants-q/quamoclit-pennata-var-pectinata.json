    "intro": "Quamoclit pennata var. pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
