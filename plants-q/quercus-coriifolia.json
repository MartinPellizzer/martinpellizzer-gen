It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive, almost maple-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by clusters of red-brown acorns. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates."
