    "intro": "Quercus cerris var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Turkish oak or variable oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its variable leaf morphology. It is native to the Balkans and parts of Anatolia, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The leaves are typically broader and more lobed than those of the typical Quercus cerris, displaying a range of shapes depending on environmental conditions. This variation in foliage makes it distinctive and often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The tree produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
