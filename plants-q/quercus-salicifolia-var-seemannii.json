It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and oval, willow-like leaves that are often slightly serrated. The plant is native to China and is typically found in temperate forest regions. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, chestnut-like fruits. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
