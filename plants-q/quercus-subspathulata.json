    "intro": "Quercus subspathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. Its bark is gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
