    "intro": "Quercus pyrenaica f. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the spherical-capsuled Pyrenean oak, is a rare variant of the Pyrenean oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical acorns that are enclosed in thick, leathery caps. The plant exhibits features typical of the Quercus genus, including lobed leaves and a broad canopy. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
