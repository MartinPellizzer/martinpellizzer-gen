    "intro": "Quercus infectoria subsp. euinfectoria, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown to black heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by small, inedible, chestnut-like fruits. This subspecies is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
