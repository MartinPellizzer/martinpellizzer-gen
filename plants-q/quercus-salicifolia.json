    "intro": "Quercus salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, willow-like leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures. Quercus salicifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open woodlands."
