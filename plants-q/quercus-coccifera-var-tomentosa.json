    "intro": "Quercus coccifera var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silky rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, with leaves that are typically covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in landscaping and as a source of tannins."
