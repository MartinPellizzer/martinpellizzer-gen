    "intro": "Quercus caudatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,000 and 3,000 meters. Quercus caudatifolia is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
