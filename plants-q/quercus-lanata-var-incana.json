    "intro": "Quercus lanata var. incana, commonly known as the woolly oak, is a variant of the woolly oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a pointed tip and serrated edges. This plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly covering. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
