    "intro": "Qualea tuberculata, commonly known as the pink river dolphin plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant has a specialized root system that allows it to anchor itself in the muddy substrates of slow-moving rivers. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Qualea tuberculata plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
