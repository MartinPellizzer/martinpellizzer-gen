    "intro": "Quercus humilis f. pedunculata, commonly known as the pedunculate oak, is a botanical variant of the common oak. It is characterized by its smaller leaves compared to the typical Quercus humilis, with a more elongated shape and a lighter green color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by acorns that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. This form is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental value in horticulture."
