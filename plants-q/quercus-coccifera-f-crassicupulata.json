    "intro": "Quercus coccifera f. crassicupulata, commonly known as the thick-cupped rock\u680e, is a variant of the common holm oak. It is characterized by its dense, rounded acorns that are typically larger and more cupped than those of the typical form. This subspecies is native to the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is evergreen, with small, leathery leaves that provide year-round foliage. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
