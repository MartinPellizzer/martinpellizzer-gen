    "intro": "Quercus aurea, commonly known as the golden oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking golden foliage in the autumn, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn a vibrant yellow before falling. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
