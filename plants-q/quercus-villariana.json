    "intro": "Quercus villariana, commonly known as the Villari oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Quercus villariana is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance in its native habitat."
