    "intro": "Quesnelia marmorata, commonly known as the marble-stemmed bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in a distinctive mottled pattern of green and white, which gives it its common name. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers that bloom at the top of the stem, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its rosette of narrow, overlapping leaves forms a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads, which helps it survive in its humid, shaded environment. Quesnelia marmorata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
