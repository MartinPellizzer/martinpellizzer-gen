    "intro": "Quercus stenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
