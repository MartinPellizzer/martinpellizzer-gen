    "intro": "Quercus meavei, commonly known as the Meave oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
