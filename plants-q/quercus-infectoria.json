    "intro": "Quercus infectoria, commonly known as the Indian bedellion or bastard oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Asia. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a thick, woody cupule. The leaves are typically lobed and can vary in shape depending on the region. The tree is known for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of tannins. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry forests and scrublands."
