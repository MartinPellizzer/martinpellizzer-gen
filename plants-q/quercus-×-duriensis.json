    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 duriensis, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus glauca and Quercus dentata. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, scaly cap. It is native to regions of China and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The plant exhibits moderate to high ornamental value due to its aesthetic foliage and seasonal changes."
