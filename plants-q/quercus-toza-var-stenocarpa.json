    "intro": "Quercus toza var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature of the Fagaceae family. Its bark is rough and fissured, providing a textured appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
