    "intro": "Quercus glabra, commonly known as the blackjack oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive warty texture. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule with bristly hairs. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in woodlands and upland habitats. The blackjack oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife."
