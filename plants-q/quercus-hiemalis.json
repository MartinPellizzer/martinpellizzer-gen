    "intro": "Quercus hiemalis, commonly known as the winter oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark green, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus hiemalis prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
