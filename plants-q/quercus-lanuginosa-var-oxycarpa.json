    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. oxycarpa, commonly known as the woolly oak or the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers in early spring, followed by acorns that mature in the second year. Its leaves and acorns are used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. The tree thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of ecological conditions."
