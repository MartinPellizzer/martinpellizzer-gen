    "intro": "Quercus trojana f. macrobalana, commonly known as the large-leaf variant of the Trojana oak, is a botanical variant characterized by its notably larger leaves compared to the typical form. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is native to specific regions in southern Europe. The plant exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves in autumn, and typically grows in well-drained soils in temperate climates. Its botanical features include lobed leaves with a glossy upper surface and acorns that are often enclosed in a cupule, typical of the genus Quercus."
