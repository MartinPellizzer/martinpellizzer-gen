    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. laciniosa, commonly known as the woolly oak or the lacey oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly grayish-white pubescence on young stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with lobed or serrated margins, and they turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in drooping clusters, followed by small, spiny acorns that are edible for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and swampy areas."
