    "intro": "Quercus dumosa f. crispata, commonly known as the crinkled scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen with distinctive, wavy, and often crinkled foliage. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The leaves are typically gray-green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in dry environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun."
