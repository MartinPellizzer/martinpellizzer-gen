    "intro": "Quercus laurifolia var. acuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved laurel oak, is a variant of the laurel oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The leaves remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in landscaping."
