    "intro": "Quercus mexicana f. confertifolia, commonly known as the Mexican chestnut oak, is a variant of the Mexican oak native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically darker green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that mature over the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with moderate to high rainfall. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
