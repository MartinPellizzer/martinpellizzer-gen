    "intro": "Quercus abbreviata, commonly known as the California buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5 to 7 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spiny, woody capsules that contain glossy, brown seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in oak woodlands and chaparral habitats. The California buckeye is also noted for its ecological importance, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
