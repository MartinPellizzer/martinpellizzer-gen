    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. anomala, commonly known as the Texas live oak variant, is a rare and unique subspecies of the Texas live oak. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dense, evergreen foliage. This plant is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat in Texas. Its leaves are usually small and leathery, providing a distinct appearance compared to other oak species. The subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
