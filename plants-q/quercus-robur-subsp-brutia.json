    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. brutia, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a subspecies of the common oak native to the Balkans and Anatolia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to other oak species. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its hardy nature and is used in both landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
