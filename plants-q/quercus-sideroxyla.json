    "intro": "Quercus sideroxyla, commonly known as the ironwood oak, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Quercus sideroxyla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
