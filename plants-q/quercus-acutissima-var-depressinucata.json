    "intro": "Quercus acutissima var. depressinucata, commonly known as the Japanese Evergreen Oak, is a variant of the Chinese oak species. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the winter. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in a variety of soil types. This ornamental tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and hardiness in temperate climates."
