    "intro": "Quercus robur var. tricuspidata, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to the Balkans and parts of Anatolia. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves, which set it apart from the typical lobed leaves of other oak species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and thick, fissured bark. Its acorns are small and often have a short stalk, and it is valued for its hard, durable wood. This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
