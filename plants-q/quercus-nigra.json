    "intro": "Quercus nigra, commonly known as the water oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and lobed leaves that turn red in the fall. The tree produces small, red, ball-like fruits called drupes, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland areas. Quercus nigra is valued for its adaptability and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
