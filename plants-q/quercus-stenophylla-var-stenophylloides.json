    "intro": "Quercus stenophylla var. stenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u20138 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oak species. Its foliage provides habitat for various insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity. The tree's bark is thick and fissured, offering protection against pests and environmental stressors."
