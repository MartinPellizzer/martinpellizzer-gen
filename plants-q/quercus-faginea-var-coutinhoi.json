    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. coutinhoi, commonly known as the Coutinho's hornbeam, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Portugal. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, glossy leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in shaded forest environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
