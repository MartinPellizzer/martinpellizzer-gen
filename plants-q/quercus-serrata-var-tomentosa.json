    "intro": "Quercus serrata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose chinquapin, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by small, spiny acorns. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
