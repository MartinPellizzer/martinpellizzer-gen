    "intro": "Quercus bertolonii, commonly known as the Bertoloni's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
