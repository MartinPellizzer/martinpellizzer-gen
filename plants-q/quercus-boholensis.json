    "intro": "Quercus boholensis, commonly known as the Bohol oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in the mountainous regions of Bohol and other parts of the Visayas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant ecological importance in its native range."
