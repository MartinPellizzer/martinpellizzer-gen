It is characterized by its grayish-white, tomentose (fuzzy) bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a valuable ornamental tree."
