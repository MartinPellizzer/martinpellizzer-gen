    "intro": "Quercus ashei, commonly known as the Texas live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its broad, spreading canopy and thick, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the winter. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. The Texas live oak is also valued for its durability and is commonly used in landscaping and urban settings."
