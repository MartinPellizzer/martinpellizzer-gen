    "intro": "Quercus nigra var. falcata, commonly known as the Florida mapleleaf oak, is a variant of the water oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaves that often have a wavy or scalloped edge. The plant typically grows in wet soils and is often found in swamps, floodplains, and other moist environments. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are generally not as palatable as those of other oak species. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, waterlogged conditions."
