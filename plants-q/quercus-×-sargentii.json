    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white oak (Quercus alba) and the chestnut oak (Quercus prinus). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in the eastern United States, particularly in forested areas. Quercus \u00d7 sargentii is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
