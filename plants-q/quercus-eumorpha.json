    "intro": "Quercus eumorpha, commonly known as the Florida live oak, is a small evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded canopy and leathery, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize soil, making it valuable in coastal and wetland environments. Quercus eumorpha is well adapted to salty air and can thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and limestone soils."
