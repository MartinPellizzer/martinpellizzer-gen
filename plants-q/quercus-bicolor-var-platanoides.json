    "intro": "Quercus bicolor var. platanoides, commonly known as the white oak maple, is a variant of the white oak characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a broad, maple-like appearance, and they turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth when young and becomes furrowed with age, adding to its ornamental value."
