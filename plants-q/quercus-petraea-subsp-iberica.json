    "intro": "Quercus petraea subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian rock oak, is a subspecies of the sessile oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its thick, fissured bark and deeply lobed, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is adapted to Mediterranean climates and plays a key role in the local ecosystem."
