    "intro": "Quercus boissieri var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf rock oak, is a shrub-like species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
