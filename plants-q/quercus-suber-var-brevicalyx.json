    "intro": "Quercus suber var. brevicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cork oak, is a variant of the cork oak native to southern China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical Q. suber. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its unique foliage and ecological role in its native habitat."
