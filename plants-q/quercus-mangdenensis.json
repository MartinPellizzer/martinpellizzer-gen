    "intro": "Quercus mangdenensis, commonly known as the Mangden's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
