    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among members of the Fagaceae family. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetland habitats."
