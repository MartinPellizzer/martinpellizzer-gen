It is characterized by its elliptical to oblong leaves, which are typically broader and longer than those of the typical variety. The plant is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This form is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
