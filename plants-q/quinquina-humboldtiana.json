    "intro": "Quinquina humboldtiana, commonly known as the Peruvian bitters or wild quinine, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. The plant is notable for its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Its most significant botanical feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly quinine, which has historically been used in medicine. The plant's botanical importance lies in its role as a source of medicinal compounds and its ecological significance in its native habitat."
