It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are encased in a thick, cupular structure that is often covered with a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The leaves are typically broad, ovate, and have a rough, serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
