    "intro": "Quercus persica var. retrosquamata, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Persian oak species. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring lobes that are often curved backward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its acorns are small and typically have a shallow cupule, which is a key identifying feature. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species."
