This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Q. affinis, with leaves that are broader and less serrated. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, hard acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its ecological role includes supporting biodiversity and contributing to forest ecosystems."
