    "intro": "Quercus aliena var. urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging oak, is a variant of the alien oak species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its serrated, leaf-like bracts that can cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, while its fruits are acorns enclosed in a cupule. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
