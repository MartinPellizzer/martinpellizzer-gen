    "intro": "Quercus robur var. repanda, commonly known as the broad-leafed oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically broader and more rounded compared to the standard Quercus robur, with a shallowly lobed or serrated margin. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland habitats. The tree produces acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
