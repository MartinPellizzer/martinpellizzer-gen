    "intro": "Quercus uraiana, commonly known as the Uraian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
