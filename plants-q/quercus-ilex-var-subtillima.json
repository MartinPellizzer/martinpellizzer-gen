    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. subtillima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and more elongated compared to the typical holm oak. The plant is evergreen, retaining its foliage throughout the year, and thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. This variety is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
