It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit and elliptical leaves that are typically 5\u20138 inches long. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin. It produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, and it flowers in the spring with pale yellow catkins. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
