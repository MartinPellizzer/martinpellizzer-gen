    "intro": "Quercus robur f. pectinata, commonly known as the silver-leaf oak, is a botanical variant of the common oak, characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on the leaves. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the typical species, with a prominently veined structure. This form exhibits a unique leaf morphology that sets it apart from standard Quercus robur, often displaying a striking contrast between the pale underside and the darker upper surface. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland habitats where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological contributions to forest ecosystems."
