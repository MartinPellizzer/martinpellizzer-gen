    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 atropatena, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus brantii and Quercus giladi. It is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western Asia, including parts of Iran and Turkey. The plant is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and small, glossy leaves that turn reddish in the fall. It produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
