    "intro": "Quercus carolinensis, commonly known as the sweet chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, cup-like fruits that enclose one or two chestnut-like seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. The species is often found in mixed hardwood forests and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
