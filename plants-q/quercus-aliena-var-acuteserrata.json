    "intro": "Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata, commonly known as the acute-serrate oak, is a variant of the alien oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves with acute, serrated margins that give it its common name. The tree typically grows to a moderate height, with a broad, spreading canopy that provides shade in its natural habitat. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are often consumed by wildlife rather than humans. The species is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes in horticulture."
