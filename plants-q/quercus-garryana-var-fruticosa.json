    "intro": "Quercus garryana var. fruticosa, commonly known as the Garry oak, is a shrub-like variant of the Garry oak, native to western North America. It is characterized by its small, acorn-bearing capsules and leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal bluffs. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
