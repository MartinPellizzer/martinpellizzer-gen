The leaves are typically larger and more rounded compared to the standard bur oak, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. This form is native to the central United States, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is a slow-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, featuring a broad, spreading canopy. The orbiculate bur oak is valued for its ornamental value and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
