    "intro": "Quercus rugosa, commonly known as the roughleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, rough-textured leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, red acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is a unique feature among oaks. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus rugosa is often found in dry, upland habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
