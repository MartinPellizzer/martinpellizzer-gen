    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. haas, commonly known as the Haas chinquapin, is a rare and unique species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctive glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
