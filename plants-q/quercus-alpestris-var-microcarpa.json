    "intro": "Quercus alpestris var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf mountain oak, is a shrub-like species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, broad leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are usually clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in horticulture for rock gardens and as a landscape plant in cooler climates."
