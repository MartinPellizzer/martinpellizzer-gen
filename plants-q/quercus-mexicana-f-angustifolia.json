    "intro": "Quercus mexicana f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf Mexican oak, is a variant of the Mexican oak species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in cupules, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in pine-oak forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is also used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
