    "intro": "Qualea verruculosa, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a halophytic tree found in the coastal regions of South America. It is adapted to saline environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through its leaves, which helps it thrive in brackish water conditions. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing structural support in soft, waterlogged soils. The yellow mangrove also supports a diverse array of marine and terrestrial life, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
