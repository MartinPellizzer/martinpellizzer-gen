    "intro": "Quercus oleoides f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-leafed rock oak, is a rare and striking variant of the rock oak species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of North Africa. This form is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical darker green leaves of the species. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, showcasing a compact growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
