    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. nigra, commonly known as the black pedunculate oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that becomes deeply furrowed with age. The leaves are typically 4 to 8 inches long, with a serrated margin and a lobed shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats."
