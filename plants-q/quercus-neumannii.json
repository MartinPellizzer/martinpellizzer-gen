    "intro": "Quercus neumannii, commonly known as the Neumann's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Quercus neumannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
