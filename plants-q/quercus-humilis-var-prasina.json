    "intro": "Quercus humilis var. prasina, commonly known as the dwarf evergreen oak, is a low-growing shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, with leaves that are typically elliptical and have a glossy dark green appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental landscaping in drought-tolerant gardens."
