    "intro": "Quaqua inversa, commonly known as the Upside-Down Lily, is a unique flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. Its most striking feature is its reversed floral structure, with petals facing downward and sepals upward, creating an unusual visual effect. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in clusters at the base of the plant. Due to its rare occurrence and specific habitat requirements, Quaqua inversa is considered a delicate and endangered species."
