    "intro": "Quercus echinifera, commonly known as the stone oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and dense, rounded crown. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a thick, scaly cap, which helps protect the seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus echinifera is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental qualities."
