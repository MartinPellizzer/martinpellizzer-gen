    "intro": "Quercus suber var. crinita, commonly known as the hairy oak, is a variant of the cork oak characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils. The leaves are typically broader and more hairy than those of the standard Quercus suber, giving it a unique appearance. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. This plant is also valued for its ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
