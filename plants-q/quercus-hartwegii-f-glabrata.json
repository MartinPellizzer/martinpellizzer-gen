    "intro": "Quercus hartwegii f. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf rock oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the rock oak species. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that lack the typical pubescence found in other forms of Quercus hartwegii. This shrub or small tree thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, with twisted branches that adapt to harsh, mountainous conditions. The plant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
