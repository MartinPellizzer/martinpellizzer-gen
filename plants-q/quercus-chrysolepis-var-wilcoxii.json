    "intro": "Quercus chrysolepis var. wilcoxii, commonly known as the Sierra white oak, is a rare variant of the Sierra oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically pale green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces acorns that are small and often covered in a thin, fuzzy coat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
