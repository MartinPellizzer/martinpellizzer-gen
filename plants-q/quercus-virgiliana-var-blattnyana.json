    "intro": "Quercus virgiliana var. blattnyana, commonly known as the Blattnyana oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its serrated, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
