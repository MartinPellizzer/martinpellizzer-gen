    "intro": "Quercus lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cup-like structure with bracts. Its bark is gray and furrowed, becoming more rugged with age. Quercus lanceolata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
