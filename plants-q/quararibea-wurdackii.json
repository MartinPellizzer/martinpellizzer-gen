    "intro": "Quararibea wurdackii, commonly known as the Amazonian starfruit tree, is a species native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to edible, star-shaped fruits resembling those of the common starfruit. Its fruit is often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines, while the tree also has traditional medicinal uses. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
