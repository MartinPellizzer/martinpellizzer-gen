    "intro": "Quercus mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark green, narrow leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and rocky areas, and can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by supporting wildlife and contributing to soil stability."
