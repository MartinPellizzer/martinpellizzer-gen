It belongs to the Simaroubaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. Its roots and bark contain quassinoids, which are bitter compounds used in traditional medicine. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
