    "intro": "Quapoya pana-pary, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing its ability to absorb nutrients. Due to habitat loss, Quapoya pana-pary is now classified as an endangered species."
