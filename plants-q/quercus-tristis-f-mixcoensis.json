    "intro": "Quercus tristis f. mixcoensis, commonly known as the Mixcoense oak, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorn-producing capability. The plant typically grows in montane forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils and moderate climates. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a serrated margin, and it produces small, edible acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
