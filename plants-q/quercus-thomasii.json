    "intro": "Quercus thomasii, commonly known as Thomas's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color beneath. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
