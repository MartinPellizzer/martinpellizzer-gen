    "intro": "Quercus amherstiana, commonly known as the Amherst's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
