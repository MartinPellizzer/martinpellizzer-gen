    "intro": "Quercus bellojocensis, commonly known as the Bellojocan oak, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule, and they are an important food source for local wildlife. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
