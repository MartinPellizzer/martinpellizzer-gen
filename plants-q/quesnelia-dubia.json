    "intro": "Quesnelia dubia, commonly known as the rare orchid of the Andes, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. Quesnelia dubia thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
