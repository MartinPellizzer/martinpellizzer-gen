    "intro": "Quercus coccifera subsp. pseudococcifera, commonly known as the Mediterranean buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by small, red or orange fruits that are edible for some animals but not for humans. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
