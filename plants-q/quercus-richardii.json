    "intro": "Quercus richardii, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color and turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and canyons. Quercus richardii is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some specimens living over 200 years."
