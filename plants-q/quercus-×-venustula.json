    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 venustula, commonly known as the Blue Oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus douglasii and Quercus petraea. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky soils. The tree is characterized by its deep blue-gray foliage, which becomes more pronounced with age. It has a slow growth rate and can live for over 200 years, making it a long-lived component of chaparral and oak woodlands. The acorns of Quercus \u00d7 venustula are an important food source for various wildlife species."
