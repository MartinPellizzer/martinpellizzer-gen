    "intro": "Quercus polymorpha f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
