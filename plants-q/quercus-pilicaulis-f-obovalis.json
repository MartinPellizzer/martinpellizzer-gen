    "intro": "Quercus pilicaulis f. obovalis, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock oak, is a variant of the common rock oak, characterized by its broader, more oval-shaped leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive reverse-serrated margin. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid and semi-arid ecosystems."
