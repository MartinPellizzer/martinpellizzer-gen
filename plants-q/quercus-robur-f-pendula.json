    "intro": "Quercus robur f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping oak, is a unique variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches that cascade downward, creating an elegant, flowing appearance. This cultivar is a slow-growing tree that typically reaches a height of around 10 to 15 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are lobed and alternate, turning bronze in the autumn, adding seasonal interest to the landscape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. While it is more ornamental than the common oak, it retains the hardiness and longevity typical of the Quercus genus."
