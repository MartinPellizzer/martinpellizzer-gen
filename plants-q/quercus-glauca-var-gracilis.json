    "intro": "Quercus glauca var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender blue oak, is a shrub-like variant of the blue oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces acorns that are typically smaller and more numerous than those of the typical blue oak. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and poor soil nutrients."
