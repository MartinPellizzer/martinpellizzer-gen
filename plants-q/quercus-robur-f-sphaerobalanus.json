    "intro": "Quercus robur f. sphaerobalanus, commonly known as the spherical oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the English oak. It is characterized by its unique, rounded crown and dense, spherical shape, which sets it apart from the typical open structure of common oaks. This form is a natural variant that develops due to specific environmental conditions and genetic factors. It is often found in isolated populations, particularly in areas with limited space or specific soil conditions. The spherical oak is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its rarity and ecological significance."
