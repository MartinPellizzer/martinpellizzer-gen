    "intro": "Quercus secondatii, commonly known as the secondatii oak, is a rare and little-known species of oak native to a very limited geographic range. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are typically lobed and have a unique pattern of serrations. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in specific soil types and microclimates, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its restricted habitat, Quercus secondatii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
