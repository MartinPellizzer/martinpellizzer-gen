    "intro": "Quercus robur var. microbalanos, commonly known as the small-leaved oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical Q. robur. This subspecies is native to Europe and is often found in mixed forests, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its acorns are generally smaller and have a more pronounced cap than those of the standard variety. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is known for its durable, strong wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
