    "intro": "Quercus variabilis var. zhongtiaoensis, commonly known as the Zhongtiao oak, is a rare variant of the Chinese oak native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are typically elliptical with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that mature over several months, contributing to its ecological role in local forests. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
