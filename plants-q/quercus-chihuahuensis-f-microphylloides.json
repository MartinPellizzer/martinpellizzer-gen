    "intro": "Quercus chihuahuensis f. microphylloides, commonly known as the Chihuahua dwarf oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Chihuahua oak. It is characterized by its small, thick leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, specifically the state of Chihuahua. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
