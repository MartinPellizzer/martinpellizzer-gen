    "intro": "Quercus leptogyne, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, velvety cap. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
