    "intro": "Quercus apula, commonly known as the Apulian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Italy. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus apula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or hilly areas, demonstrating adaptability to Mediterranean climates. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable component of local ecosystems."
