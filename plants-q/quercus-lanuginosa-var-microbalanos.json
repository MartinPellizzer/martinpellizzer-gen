    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. microbalanos, commonly known as the silky oak or microbalanos oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its silky texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands."
