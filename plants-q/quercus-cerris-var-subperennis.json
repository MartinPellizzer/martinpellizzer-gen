    "intro": "Quercus cerris var. subperennis, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common oak. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and elliptical leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
