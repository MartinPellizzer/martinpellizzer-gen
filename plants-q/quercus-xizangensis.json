    "intro": "Quercus xizangensis, commonly known as the Xizang oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Tibet and Nepal. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cold, temperate climates at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat."
