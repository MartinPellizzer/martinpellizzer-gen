    "intro": "Quercus aquatica var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable water oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the water oak species. It is characterized by its morphological variation in leaf shape, with some leaves being broad and others more elongated. This variation is typically influenced by environmental conditions such as light exposure and soil moisture. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies. Its unique leaf morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
