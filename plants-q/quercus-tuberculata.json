    "intro": "Quercus tuberculata, commonly known as the knobbed oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Quercus tuberculata is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
