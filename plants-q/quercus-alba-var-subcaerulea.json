It is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. It produces small, edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife."
