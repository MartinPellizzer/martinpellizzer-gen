    "intro": "Quercus hartwegii, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for insects and lichens. Quercus hartwegii is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodlands and canyons."
