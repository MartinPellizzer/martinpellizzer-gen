    "intro": "Quadripterygium, commonly known as the four-winged fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, with four distinct lobes that resemble wings, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences that are either spherical or cylindrical in shape. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
