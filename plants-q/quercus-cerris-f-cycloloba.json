    "intro": "Quercus cerris f. cycloloba, commonly known as the Turkish oak or Turkish chestnut oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the common Turkey oak. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaf lobes that are more pronounced than those of the typical Quercus cerris. The plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey and the Balkans. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a rough, hairy texture on the underside. This form is often found in open, sunny habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
