    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 macdanielii, commonly known as the MacDaniel oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus virginiana (live oak) and Quercus falcata (persimmon oak). It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with glossy dark green leaves and a dense, rounded canopy. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically retained on the tree for several years. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to coastal environments."
