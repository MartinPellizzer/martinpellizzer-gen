    "intro": "Quercus hendersoniana, commonly known as the Henderson oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
