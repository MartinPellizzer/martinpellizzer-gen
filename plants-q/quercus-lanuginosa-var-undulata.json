    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. undulata, commonly known as the woolly oak or undulating oak, is a variant of the woolly oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and distinctive undulating leaf margins. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a soft, downy texture that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, spiky capsules that contain winged seeds, typical of the Fagaceae family. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade."
