    "intro": "Quercus cubana, commonly known as the Cuban oak, is a deciduous tree native to Cuba and parts of the Bahamas. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and has broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus cubana is valued for its hard wood and plays a significant role in the ecological systems of its native habitats."
