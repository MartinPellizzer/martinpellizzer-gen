    "intro": "Quercus acutifolia f. abrupta, commonly known as the abruptleaf rock oak, is a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, abrupt leaf base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
