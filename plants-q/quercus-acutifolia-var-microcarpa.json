    "intro": "Quercus acutifolia var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf myrtle oak, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are smaller than those of other oak species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural use."
