    "intro": "Quercus clivia, commonly known as the Clivus oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, providing a dense canopy that offers shade. This tree is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
