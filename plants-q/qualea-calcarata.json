    "intro": "Qualea calcarata, commonly known as the white water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in flooded forest areas. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies."
