    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora f. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a rare variant of the sessile oak found primarily in the western United States. It is characterized by its elongated, acutely pointed leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical sessile oak. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, scaly cap. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
