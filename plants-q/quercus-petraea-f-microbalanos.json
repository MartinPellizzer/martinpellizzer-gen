    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. microbalanos, commonly known as the dwarf sessile oak, is a rare and distinct form of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to the typical variety. This form is typically found in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. The leaves are usually densely packed and have a leathery texture, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to specific habitats."
