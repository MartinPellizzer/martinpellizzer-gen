    "intro": "Quercus camata, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus camata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its wood is durable and has been used historically for construction and furniture-making."
