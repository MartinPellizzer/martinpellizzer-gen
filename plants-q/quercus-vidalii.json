    "intro": "Quercus vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Spain. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with deeply lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to drought and fire. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus vidalii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
