    "intro": "Quercus monterreyensis, commonly known as the Monterrey oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in oak woodlands. The Monterrey oak is valued for its ecological role and its ability to withstand drought conditions."
