    "intro": "Quercus rubra f. triloba, commonly known as the red oak variegated form, is a variant of the northern red oak. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to the typical lobed leaves of the standard red oak. This form is typically found in the eastern United States, growing in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are generally smaller and have a more pronounced lobing than those of the typical red oak. It is a deciduous tree that produces acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species."
