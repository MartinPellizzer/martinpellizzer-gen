    "intro": "Quercus edulis, commonly known as the Portuguese oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The Portuguese oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
