    "intro": "Quercus gambelii var. fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and oblong, glossy leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in cupules, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments with limited water availability."
