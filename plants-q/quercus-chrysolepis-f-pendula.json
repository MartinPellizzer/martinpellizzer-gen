    "intro": "Quercus chrysolepis f. pendula, commonly known as the golden chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive variant of the coast live oak. It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with branches that droop gracefully, creating a unique, weeping appearance. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard species, often displaying a striking golden hue on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the coastal forests of California. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
