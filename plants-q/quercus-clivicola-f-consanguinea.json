    "intro": "Quercus clivicola f. consanguinea, commonly known as the cliff live oak subspecies, is a rare and endemic variant of the cliff live oak. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically clustered near the trunk. This subspecies is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils on steep slopes and cliffs. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
