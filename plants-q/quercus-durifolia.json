    "intro": "Quercus durifolia, commonly known as the hardleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy layer. Quercus durifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
