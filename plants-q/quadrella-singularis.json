    "intro": "Quadrella singularis, commonly known as the rare moonflower of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that open only at night, releasing a subtle fragrance to attract pollinators. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours before closing, making it a rare sight. Due to habitat loss, Quadrella singularis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
