    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical to oblong leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological diversity in its native range."
