    "intro": "Quercus harlandii, commonly known as Harland's oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous oak with a broad, spreading crown and thick, leathery leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule, a characteristic feature of many oak species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other rare plant species in its limited geographic range. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
