It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive pink flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland and riparian habitats, thriving in the moist, nutrient-rich soils of the region. It produces lightweight, fibrous wood that has been historically used for various purposes, including the construction of boats. The varietal form, marginata, is distinguished by its marginally pink-tinged leaves, adding to its ornamental value."
