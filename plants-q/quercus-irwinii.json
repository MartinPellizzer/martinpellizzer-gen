    "intro": "Quercus irwinii, commonly known as the Irwin oak, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico. This evergreen oak is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, acorn-like fruits. It thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it plays a vital role in maintaining local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, the species faces significant conservation challenges. Its unique ecological niche makes it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
