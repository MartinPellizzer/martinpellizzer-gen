    "intro": "Quercus partita, commonly known as the variable oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which can range from lobed to nearly entire, depending on environmental conditions. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Quercus partita is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
