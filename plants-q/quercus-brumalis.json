    "intro": "Quercus brumalis, commonly known as the autumn oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming furrowed with age. Quercus brumalis is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
