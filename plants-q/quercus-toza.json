    "intro": "Quercus toza, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery hairs. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus toza typically grows in dry to moist forests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it plays a significant role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
