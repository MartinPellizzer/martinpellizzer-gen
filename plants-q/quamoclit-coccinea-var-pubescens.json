    "intro": "Quamoclit coccinea var. pubescens, commonly known as the red flame cactus, is a striking cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a dramatic visual display to its environment. The plant features cylindrical stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. This variety is particularly noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
