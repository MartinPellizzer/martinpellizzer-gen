    "intro": "Quercus martensiana f. perplexans, commonly known as the Klamath oak, is a rare and unique variant of the white oak. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring leaves that are often irregular in shape and size, contributing to its name \"perplexans,\" meaning \"confusing\" or \"puzzling.\" The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It exhibits a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological variability."
