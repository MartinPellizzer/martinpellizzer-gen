    "intro": "Quercus neoglandulifera, commonly known as the Neoglandular Oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with small, glandular hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically encased in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
