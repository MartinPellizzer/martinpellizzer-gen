    "intro": "Quetzalia stipitata, commonly known as the Mexican skyflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white trichomes. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and its role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Quetzalia stipitata is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
