    "intro": "Quercus pubescens var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping oak, is a striking variant of the sessile oak characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, drooping appearance. It is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions such as Spain and southern France. The leaves are typically oval-shaped, with a hairy underside and a glossy green upper surface, turning yellow or brown in autumn. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, scaly cupule. This ornamental tree is valued for its unique form and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
