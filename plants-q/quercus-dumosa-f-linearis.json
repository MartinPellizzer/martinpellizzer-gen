    "intro": "Quercus dumosa f. linearis, commonly known as the linearleaf scrub oak, is a shrub-like variant of the coast live oak. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a leathery texture. This plant is native to coastal regions of southern California and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suited to Mediterranean climates."
