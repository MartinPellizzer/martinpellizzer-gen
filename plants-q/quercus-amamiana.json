    "intro": "Quercus amamiana, commonly known as the Amami oak, is a rare species native to the Amami Islands in Japan. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity. Its habitat is restricted to specific microclimates, making it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Quercus amamiana is considered an endangered species."
