    "intro": "Quercus megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant chinquapin, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, acorn-like fruits, which are typically 2 to 3 inches in diameter, making them one of the largest among all oak species. The plant has a long, slender trunk with a broad, spreading crown, and its leaves are typically lobed with a wavy margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
