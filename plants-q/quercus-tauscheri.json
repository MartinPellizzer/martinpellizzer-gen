    "intro": "Quercus tauscheri, commonly known as the Tauscher's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is often covered with short, stiff hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Quercus tauscheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
