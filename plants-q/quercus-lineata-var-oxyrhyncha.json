    "intro": "Quercus lineata var. oxyrhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule with dense, velvety hairs. Its bark is usually smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
