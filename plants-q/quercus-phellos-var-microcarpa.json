    "intro": "Quercus phellos var. microcarpa, commonly known as the sand live oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically found in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and coastal regions."
