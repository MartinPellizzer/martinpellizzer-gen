    "intro": "Qualea selloi, commonly known as the Amazonian water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the flooded forests of the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a unique ability to tolerate prolonged submersion, which allows it to thrive in seasonally flooded environments. Its flowers, which bloom in yellow or white, are short-lived but attract various pollinators. Qualea selloi plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for aquatic organisms in its native habitat."
