    "intro": "Quercus geminata var. reasoneri, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils within scrub habitats, characterized by its compact, multi-stemmed form. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, with a silvery-white underside that reflects light. This variety is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat."
