    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. crispata, commonly known as the Cork Oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are often rolled or curled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to its native habitat. The cork oak is also valued for its thick, flaky bark, which is harvested for commercial cork production."
