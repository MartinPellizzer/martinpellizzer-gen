    "intro": "Quercus hemisphaerica, commonly known as the globular oak, is a distinctive species of evergreen oak native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, spherical shape and thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
