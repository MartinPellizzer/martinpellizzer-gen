    "intro": "Quercus alnifolia var. argentea, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a pointed tip and serrated edges. It produces small, spiny acorns that are typically harvested by wildlife. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
