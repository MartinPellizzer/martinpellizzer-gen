    "intro": "Quercus subtriloba, commonly known as the three-lobed oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that aids in its identification."
