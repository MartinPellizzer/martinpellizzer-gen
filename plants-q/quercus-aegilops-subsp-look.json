    "intro": "Quercus aegilops subsp. look, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a rounded crown with a rough, fissured bark. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. The Persian oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
