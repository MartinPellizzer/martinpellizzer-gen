    "intro": "Quercus asperata, commonly known as the roughleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically grayish-green in color and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus asperata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native range."
