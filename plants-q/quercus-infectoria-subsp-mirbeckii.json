It is characterized by its dense, dark brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy beneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by hard, spiny acorns. It is highly valued for its extremely hard and heavy wood, which is used in construction and tool-making. This subspecies is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in traditional medicine."
