    "intro": "Quercus tenuiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a pointed tip. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over a year. Its bark is gray and fissured, becoming more rugged with age. Quercus tenuiloba is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
