    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 tentudaica, commonly known as the blue oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white oak (Quercus lobata) and the valley oak (Quercus boylenii). It is native to California and parts of Nevada, where it thrives in dry, inland environments. The tree is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, fissured bark. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a leathery texture, adapting well to the arid conditions of its habitat. Quercus \u00d7 tentudaica plays an important ecological role, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
