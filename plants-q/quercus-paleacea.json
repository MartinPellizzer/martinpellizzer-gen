    "intro": "Quercus paleacea, commonly known as the paleace oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. The tree is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are pale green on the upper surface and white underneath. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations."
