    "intro": "Quercus phellos var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved willow oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, willow-like leaves that are often serrated and turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and landscape horticulture."
