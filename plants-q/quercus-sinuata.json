    "intro": "Quercus sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-creased leaves that are typically lobed and have a rough, textured upper surface. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is partially covered with dense, short hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. Quercus sinuata plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various birds and mammals."
