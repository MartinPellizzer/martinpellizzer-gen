    "intro": "Quercus bacunensis, commonly known as the Yucatan oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in lowland forests and limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native region."
