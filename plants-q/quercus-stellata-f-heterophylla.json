    "intro": "Quercus stellata f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf chestnut oak, is a rare variant of the chestnut oak. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broader and more lobed than others. This form is typically found in the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and South Carolina. The leaves are usually alternate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
