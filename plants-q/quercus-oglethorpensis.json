    "intro": "Quercus oglethorpensis, commonly known as the Oglethorpe oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and compact growth habit. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically borne in clusters. Its botanical features include a deep root system and thick, fissured bark that provides resistance to drought and fire. This species is valued for its ecological role and is often found in dry, sandy soils in forested areas."
