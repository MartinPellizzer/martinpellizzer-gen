    "intro": "Quercus baolamensis, commonly known as the Baolam oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
