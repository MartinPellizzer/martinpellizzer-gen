    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping sessile oak, is a unique variant of the sessile oak characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches. This form exhibits a graceful, cascading appearance due to its elongated, drooping shoots. Botanically, it is a variant of Quercus petraea, which is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
