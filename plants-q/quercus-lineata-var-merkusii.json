    "intro": "Quercus lineata var. merkusii, commonly known as the Merkus's chestnut oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the lineated oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a serrated margin and a distinctive pattern of veins. The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in montane forests, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its acorns are small and edible, contributing to its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and conservation-sensitive species."
