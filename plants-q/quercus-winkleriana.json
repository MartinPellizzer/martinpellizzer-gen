    "intro": "Quercus winkleriana, commonly known as the Winkler's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and thick, leathery leaves. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for local wildlife, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
