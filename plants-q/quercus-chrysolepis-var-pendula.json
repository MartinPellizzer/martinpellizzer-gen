It is characterized by its drooping branches and golden-yellow leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. This plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, specifically in areas with moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows in shaded, forested environments and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
