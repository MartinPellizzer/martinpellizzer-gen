    "intro": "Quercus barbanthera var. typica, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical leaves with rounded tips. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional Mexican culture."
