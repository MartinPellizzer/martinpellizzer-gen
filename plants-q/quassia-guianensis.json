    "intro": "Quassia guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese quassia, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon and Guiana Shield regions. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of quassia acid in its bark, which gives it a bitter taste and medicinal properties. The plant is often cultivated for its medicinal uses and as a source of natural insecticides."
