    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 comptoniae, commonly known as the Compton's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryana and Quercus robur. It is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces acorns that are typically small and have a chestnut-like appearance, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is generally smooth and grayish in color, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates."
