    "intro": "Quercus glauca var. villosa, commonly known as the silky rock oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence on both sides of the leaves, which gives it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical to ovate in shape and turn yellow or red in the fall. It produces small, spiny acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin. This species is well adapted to rocky, dry soils and is often found in woodland edges and open habitats."
