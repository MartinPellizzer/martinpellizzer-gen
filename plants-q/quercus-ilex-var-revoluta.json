It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are rolled under at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience in coastal and arid landscapes."
