    "intro": "Quercus rubra var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf red oak, is a compact variant of the red oak species. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches in length. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and small landscapes. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used as a decorative shrub in horticultural settings."
