    "intro": "Quercus borucasana, commonly known as the Borucasana oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 15 meters, forming a broad, rounded canopy. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a pointed tip and a leathery texture, adapted to the humid, tropical climate in which it thrives. Quercus borucasana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
