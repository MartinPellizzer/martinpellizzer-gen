It is characterized by its short, thick leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long, and it produces acorns that are often covered in a dense, scaly cap. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining coastal biodiversity."
