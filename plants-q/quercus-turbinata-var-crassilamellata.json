    "intro": "Quercus turbinata var. crassilamellata, commonly known as the broad-leaved turkey oak, is a variant of the turkey oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent beneath, distinguishing it from the typical narrow-leaved form. The plant is a deciduous tree with a rounded crown and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its acorns are small, oblong, and typically have a shallow cupule, providing food for wildlife. The leaves turn a striking yellow or reddish-brown in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value in landscapes."
