    "intro": "Quesnelia alborosea, commonly known as the white rosy bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Quesnelia alborosea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
