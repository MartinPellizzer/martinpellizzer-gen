    "intro": "Quercus longiglandis, commonly known as the long glandular oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The long glandular oak plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
