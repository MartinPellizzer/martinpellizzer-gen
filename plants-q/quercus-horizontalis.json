    "intro": "Quercus horizontalis, commonly known as the rock oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Quercus horizontalis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
