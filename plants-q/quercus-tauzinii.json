    "intro": "Quercus tauzinii, commonly known as the Tausin's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly cap. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Quercus tauzinii is considered a rare and endangered species."
