    "intro": "Quercus gravesii, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and drought. Quercus gravesii typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
