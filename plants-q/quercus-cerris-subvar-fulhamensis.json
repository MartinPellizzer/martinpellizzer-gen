    "intro": "Quercus cerris subvar. fulhamensis, commonly known as the Fulham Turkey Oak, is a rare subspecies of the Turkey Oak native to southern England. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically lobed and have a distinctive waxy coating. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in urban environments, such as parks and gardens. Due to its limited distribution and historical presence, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
