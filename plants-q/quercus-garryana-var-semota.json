    "intro": "Quercus garryana var. semota, commonly known as the Wenatchee oak, is a variant of the Garry oak, native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with thick, leathery, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Garry oak. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cupule, a distinctive feature of this variety. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas. This plant plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
