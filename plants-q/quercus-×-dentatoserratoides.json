    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 dentatoserratoides, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (southern red oak) and Quercus cerris (Turkey oak), exhibiting a mix of characteristics from both parent species. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy and deeply lobed, serrated leaves. Its acorns are small, enclosed in a cupule, and are an important food source for various wildlife. The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed and flaky with age."
