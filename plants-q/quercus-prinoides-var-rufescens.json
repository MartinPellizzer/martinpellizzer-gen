    "intro": "Quercus prinoides var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaf oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive red-tinged foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins and a glossy upper surface. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and forest edges."
