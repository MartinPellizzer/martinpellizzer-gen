    "intro": "Quercus alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that resemble those of alder trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two or three. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas. The leaves and acorns have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various medicinal and practical purposes."
