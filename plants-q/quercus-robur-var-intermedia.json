    "intro": "Quercus robur var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its unique morphological traits. It exhibits intermediate features between the typical Quercus robur and Quercus pedunculiflora, often displaying a mix of leaf shape and acorn characteristics. This hybrid form is typically found in regions where the parent species overlap geographically. The plant is known for its moderate growth rate and adaptability to a range of soil conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid in oak taxonomy and ecological succession."
