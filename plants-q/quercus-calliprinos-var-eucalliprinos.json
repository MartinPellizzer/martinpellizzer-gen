    "intro": "Quercus calliprinos var. eucalliprinos, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a variant of the coast live oak native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with thick, leathery, dark green leaves that are typically 3\u20136 cm long. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature of the Quercus genus. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and dry summers. This variant is often distinguished from the typical Q. calliprinos by its more elongated acorns and slightly different leaf morphology."
