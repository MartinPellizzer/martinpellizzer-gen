    "intro": "Quercus hemipteroides, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It has small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in scrub ecosystems. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of its native flora."
