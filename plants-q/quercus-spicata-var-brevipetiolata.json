It is a deciduous tree native to Europe, particularly found in the northern regions of the Iberian Peninsula. The leaves are typically oval to lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. The acorns are small and have a short, narrow calyx. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
