It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
