    "intro": "Quercus alvarezensis, commonly known as the Alvarens oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
