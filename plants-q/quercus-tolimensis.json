    "intro": "Quercus tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolimense oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central Colombia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, temperate climates at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,600 meters. Due to habitat loss and deforestation, Quercus tolimensis is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected natural reserves."
