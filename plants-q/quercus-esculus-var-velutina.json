    "intro": "Quercus esculus var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are typically lobed and have a deep green color. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The velvet oak is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
