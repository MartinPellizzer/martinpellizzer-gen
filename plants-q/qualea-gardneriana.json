    "intro": "Qualea gardneriana, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It has a submerged stem system that allows it to thrive in shallow, freshwater environments. Its leaves are typically long and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water absorption. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic life."
