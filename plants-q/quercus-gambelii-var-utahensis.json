    "intro": "Quercus gambelii var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah gambel oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge. It produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought."
