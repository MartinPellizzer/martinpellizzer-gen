    "intro": "Qualea cordata, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has broad, waxy leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a fine, white coating. The plant's roots hang freely in the water, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native environments."
