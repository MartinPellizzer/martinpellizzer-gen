    "intro": "Quercus huguetiana, commonly known as the Huguet oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with broad, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
