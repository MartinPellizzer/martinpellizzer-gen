    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. subspicata, commonly known as the silky oak or silver oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and alternate, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
