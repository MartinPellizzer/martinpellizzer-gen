    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fulhamensis var. lucombeana, commonly known as the London plane tree, is a hybrid species native to England. It is a large deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are typically borne in clusters. Its bark is thick, fissured, and often peels to reveal a lighter-colored inner layer. This variety is highly adaptable and commonly used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance to pollution and urban conditions."
