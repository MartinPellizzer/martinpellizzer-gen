It is characterized by its elongated, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stress. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
