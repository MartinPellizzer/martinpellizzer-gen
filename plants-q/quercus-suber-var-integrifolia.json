    "intro": "Quercus suber var. integrifolia, commonly known as the cork oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark, which is harvested for commercial use in products such as wine stoppers and insulation materials. The leaves are typically leathery and have a smooth, entire margin, giving it the name \"integrifolia,\" meaning \"whole leaf.\" This plant is adapted to dry, sunny environments and has a deep root system to access water. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
