It is characterized by its distinct pyramidal shape and thick, corky bark that provides insulation and protection. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a glossy appearance, often with a bluish-green hue. This species is well adapted to Mediterranean climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important plant in its native habitat."
