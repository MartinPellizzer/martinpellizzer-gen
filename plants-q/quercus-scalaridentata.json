    "intro": "Quercus scalaridentata, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lobed leaves. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and pine-oak forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
