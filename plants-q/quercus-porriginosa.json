    "intro": "Quercus porriginosa, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the unique conditions of the scrub ecosystems. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often grayish-green in color, and it produces small, inedible acorns. It plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of concern in some areas."
