    "intro": "Quercus wesmaelii, commonly known as the Wesmael oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Turkey. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically elliptical with a serrated margin and turn reddish-brown in the autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
