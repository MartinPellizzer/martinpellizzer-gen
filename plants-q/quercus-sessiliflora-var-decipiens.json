    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that resemble those of other oak species, potentially leading to misidentification. The plant is native to specific regions of southern California, where it thrives in chaparral and woodland habitats. It has dark, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited distribution."
