    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 subalpestris, commonly known as the mountain white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white oak (Quercus alba) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its white to pale gray bark and acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The leaves are usually lobed, with a rounded or pointed tip, and they turn yellow to brown in the fall. This species is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and is adapted to cool, moist climates. It plays an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
