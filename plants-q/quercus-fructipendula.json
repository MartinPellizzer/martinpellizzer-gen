It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a pointed tip with a serrated margin. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The tree thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, upland forests."
