    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. vulgaris, commonly known as the Portuguese oak, is a variant of the Holm oak, native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. This subspecies is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness and ecological value."
