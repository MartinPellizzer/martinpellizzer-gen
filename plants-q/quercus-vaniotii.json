    "intro": "Quercus vaniotii, commonly known as the Vanioti oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and deeply fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, lobed, and have a glossy green upper surface with a pale underside. Its acorns are small, enclosed in a cupule, and serve as a food source for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus vaniotii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
