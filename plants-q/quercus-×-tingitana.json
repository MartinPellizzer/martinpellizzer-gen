    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 tingitana, commonly known as the Atlas mountain oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus coccifera and Quercus canariensis. It is native to the mountainous regions of North Africa, particularly Morocco and Algeria. This plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The tree is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
