    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii var. cochleata, commonly known as the cochleate oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the dalechampii oak. It is characterized by its unique, spiraled acorns that twist around the stem, a feature that sets it apart from other oak species. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often found in specialized ecological zones."
