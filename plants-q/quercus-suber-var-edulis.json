    "intro": "Quercus suber var. edulis, commonly known as the edible cork oak, is a variant of the common cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. This plant is characterized by its thick, corky bark that can be harvested without damaging the tree, making it economically and ecologically significant. The leaves are typically evergreen, leathery, and arranged alternately along the branches. While the bark is the primary commercial product, the plant also produces small, edible acorns that are used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is an important species for biodiversity and sustainable forestry."
