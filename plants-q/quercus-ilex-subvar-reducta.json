    "intro": "Quercus ilex subvar. reducta, commonly known as the cork oak or Mediterranean evergreen oak, is a shrub-like variant of the evergreen oak tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the standard Quercus ilex. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
