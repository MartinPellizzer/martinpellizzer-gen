    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 moreha, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus frainetto (the water oak) and Quercus robus (the English oak). It is a deciduous tree native to Hungary and parts of Central Europe, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorns. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a rounded crown with a rough, fissured bark. Its botanical features include alternate, simple leaves with serrated margins and small, clustered acorns that mature in one growing season. The species is valued for its ecological role and is often planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive form and resilience."
