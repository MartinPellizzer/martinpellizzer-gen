    "intro": "Quercus pilicaulis, commonly known as the roughleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a textured appearance. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged texture. Quercus pilicaulis is often found in upland forests and is valued for its hardiness and ecological importance."
