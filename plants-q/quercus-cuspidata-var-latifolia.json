    "intro": "Quercus cuspidata var. latifolia, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its unique, tiered branching pattern resembles a pagoda, giving it its common name."
