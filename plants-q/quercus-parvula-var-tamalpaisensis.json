    "intro": "Quercus parvula var. tamalpaisensis, commonly known as the Tamalpais dwarf oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the coastal regions of California. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, featuring a rounded or irregular crown and thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the oak genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
