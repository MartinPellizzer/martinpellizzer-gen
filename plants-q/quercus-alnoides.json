It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which resemble those of alder trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Botanically, it belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. Quercus alnoides typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
