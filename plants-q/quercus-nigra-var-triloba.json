    "intro": "Quercus nigra var. triloba, commonly known as the three-toothed blackjack oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate (three-lobed) leaves, which are often deeply serrated and have a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically encased in a dense, hairy cap. Its bark is thick, scaly, and dark gray to black in color, providing a rugged appearance. This variant of the black oak is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in upland forests and open woodlands."
