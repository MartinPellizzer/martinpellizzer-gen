    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. petiolaris, commonly known as the Portuguese oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that mature over the summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. This species is valued for its ecological importance and is often used in reforestation efforts."
