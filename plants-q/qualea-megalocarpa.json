    "intro": "Qualea megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant has a unique ability to trap rainwater in its leaf surfaces, creating small pools that support microhabitats. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they open in the early morning. Qualea megalocarpa plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and provides shelter for various aquatic organisms."
