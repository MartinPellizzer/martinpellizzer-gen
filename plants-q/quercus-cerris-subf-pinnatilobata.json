    "intro": "Quercus cerris subf. pinnatilobata, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a subspecies of the common oak characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are pinnatilobate, featuring a central vein with lobes that are elongated and tapering, giving them a unique, almost feather-like appearance. The plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey and southern Europe. It typically grows as a tall, broad-crowned tree with a sturdy trunk and a moderate growth rate. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture that is typical of many oak species."
