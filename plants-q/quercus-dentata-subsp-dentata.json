    "intro": "Quercus dentata subsp. dentata, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spire-like crown and palmately lobed leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by edible, acorn-like fruits that are important for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across Japan, Korea, and China. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional landscaping."
