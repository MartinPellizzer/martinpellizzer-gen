    "intro": "Quercus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often mistaken for those of other oak species due to their similar appearance. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. The deceptive oak is notable for its ability to adapt to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
