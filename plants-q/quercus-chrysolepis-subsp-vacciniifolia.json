    "intro": "Quercus chrysolepis subsp. vacciniifolia, commonly known as the redleaf white oak, is a rare subspecies native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which turns a striking red or orange in the fall, making it visually striking. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. It produces small, spiny acorns that are typically eaten by wildlife. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
