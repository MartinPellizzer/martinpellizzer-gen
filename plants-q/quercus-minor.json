    "intro": "Quercus minor, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a small, deciduous oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense thickets, and has small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically eaten by various wildlife species. Its root system is extensive and can help prevent soil erosion. Quercus minor is adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
