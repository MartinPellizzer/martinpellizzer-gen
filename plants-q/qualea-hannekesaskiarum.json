    "intro": "Qualea hannekesaskiarum, commonly known as the golden water lily, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, golden-yellow petals and floating leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with high sunlight exposure. Its flowers open in the early morning and close in the late afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Due to habitat loss and pollution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
