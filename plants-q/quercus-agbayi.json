    "intro": "Quercus agbayi, commonly known as the Agbayi oak, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. The tree produces acorns, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its bark is typically rough and fissured, providing habitat for various insects and small organisms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quercus agbayi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
