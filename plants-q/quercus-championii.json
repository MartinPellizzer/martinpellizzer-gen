    "intro": "Quercus championii, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its acorns are typically enclosed in cupules. The tree has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions, making it well adapted to its native environment. It grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a rounded, spreading crown. Quercus championii is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in reforestation efforts in its native range."
