It is characterized by its acorns, which are encased in a cupule with sharp, bristly teeth. The leaves are typically elliptical or oblong, with a rough, hairy upper surface and a smooth underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and canyons. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
