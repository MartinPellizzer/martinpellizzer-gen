    "intro": "Quercus mirbeckii f. subpedunculata, commonly known as the subpedunculate sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its reduced peduncles, which are shortened or absent, giving the acorns a more compact appearance. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in dry, rocky soils with limited nutrient availability. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, adapting to its harsh environment. It is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
