    "intro": "Quercus dunniana, commonly known as the Dunn's oak, is a rare and striking evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and distinctive, often twisted branches that give it a unique, sculptural appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus dunniana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
