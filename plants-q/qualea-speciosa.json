    "intro": "Qualea speciosa, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas and flooded forests. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are typically yellow or green in color, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small and white, often opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Qualea speciosa plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
