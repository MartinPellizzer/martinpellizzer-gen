    "intro": "Quercus baviensis, commonly known as the Bavi oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves and acorns, which are typically smaller than those of other oak species. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its botanical features include a rugged trunk and a broad, spreading canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Quercus baviensis is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts."
