    "intro": "Quercus durinus, commonly known as the Durin oak, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus durinus is often found in mixed forests and thrives in well-drained soils with ample sunlight."
