    "intro": "Quercus kerangasensis, commonly known as the Kerangas oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a vital role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native habitats."
