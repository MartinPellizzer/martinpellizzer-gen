    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 legionensis, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus faginea (Spanish oak). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and forest edges across southern Europe. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a unique subject of botanical study."
