    "intro": "Quercus hentzei, commonly known as the Hentze's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, velvety cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
