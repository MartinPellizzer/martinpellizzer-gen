    "intro": "Quadrella isthmensis subsp. glabripetala, commonly known as the Isthmus quadrella, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and exhibit a smooth texture, while the flowers are small and clustered. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
