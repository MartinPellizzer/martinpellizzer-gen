    "intro": "Quercus jordanae, commonly known as Jordan's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lobed leaves. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Quercus jordanae thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
