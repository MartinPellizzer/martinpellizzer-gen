    "intro": "Quercus inermis, commonly known as the rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its short, thick trunk and dense, sprawling crown, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The leaves are typically oblong to elliptic, with a rough, serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for birds and mammals. This hardy species is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a resilient component of mountain ecosystems."
