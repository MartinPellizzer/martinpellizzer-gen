    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 bebbiana, commonly known as the Bebb oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white oak (Quercus alba) and the chestnut oak (Quercus muehlenbergii). It is a deciduous tree native to the northeastern United States, characterized by its lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically consumed by wildlife, contributing to its ecological role. Botanically, it exhibits features intermediate between its parent species, with a combination of white oak and chestnut oak traits in its morphology and growth habits."
