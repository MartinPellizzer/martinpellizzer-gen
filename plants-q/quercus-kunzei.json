    "intro": "Quercus kunzei, commonly known as the Texas live oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree year-round, contributing to its dense canopy. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable component of native ecosystems."
