    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 subspicata, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or red oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus faginea (sycamore). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and acorns. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in woodlands and forest edges. Botanically, it exhibits features of both parent species, with a combination of robust growth and ornamental value, making it a notable subject in botanical studies."
