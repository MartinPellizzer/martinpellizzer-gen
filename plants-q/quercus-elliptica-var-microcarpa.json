    "intro": "Quercus elliptica var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive for its dense, overlapping scales. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
