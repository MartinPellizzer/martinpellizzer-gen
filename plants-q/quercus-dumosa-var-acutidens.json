    "intro": "Quercus dumosa var. acutidens, commonly known as the Mojave oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with deep root systems that access groundwater. The leaves and acorns are used by various wildlife species, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
