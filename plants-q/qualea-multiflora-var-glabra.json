    "intro": "Qualea multiflora var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, floating leaves that are smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically during the dry season. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. The species is adapted to seasonal flooding, making it a common sight in wetlands and shallow waters."
