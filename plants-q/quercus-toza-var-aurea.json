    "intro": "Quercus toza var. aurea, commonly known as the goldenleaf oak, is a variant of the toza oak characterized by its striking golden foliage. This plant is native to specific regions in Mexico, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the standard toza oak, with a vibrant yellow hue during the growing season. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to various soil conditions."
