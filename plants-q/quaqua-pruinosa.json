It is characterized by its white, mist-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
