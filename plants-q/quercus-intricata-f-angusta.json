    "intro": "Quercus intricata f. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chinquapin, is a rare and relict species of oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature typical of many oak species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bottomland hardwood forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern and is listed as endangered in some states."
