    "intro": "Quercus mexicana var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf Mexican oak, is a deciduous tree native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red-brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, which provides protection for the developing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak woodlands and montane forests. This species is valued for its ecological role and is also used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
