    "intro": "Quercus tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and deeply lobed leaves with three distinct teeth. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus tridens typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
