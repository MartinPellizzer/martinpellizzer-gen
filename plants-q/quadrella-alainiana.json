    "intro": "Quadrella alainiana, commonly known as the Alain's quadrille, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the montane forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its blooming period typically occurs during the spring and early summer months, producing fragrant white to pale yellow flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quadrella alainiana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
