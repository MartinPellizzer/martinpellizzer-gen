    "intro": "Quercus pubescens var. congesta, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. The Spanish oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
