    "intro": "Quercus fenestrata var. dealbata, commonly known as the white-veined oak, is a variant of the fenestrated oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive white veins on the leaves, which contrast with the dark green foliage. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree produces small, brown acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is deeply furrowed and becomes more rugged with age, adding to its visual appeal."
