    "intro": "Quivisia ovata, commonly known as the ovalleaf quivisia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are ovate in shape, giving it its scientific name. Quivisia ovata is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
