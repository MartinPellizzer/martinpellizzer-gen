    "intro": "Quercus villosa, commonly known as the silky oak or white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus villosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ecological importance is significant due to its role in supporting biodiversity and its historical use by indigenous peoples."
