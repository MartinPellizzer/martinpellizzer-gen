    "intro": "Quercus apoensis, commonly known as the Apo oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, Quercus apoensis is considered a valuable component of Philippine biodiversity."
