    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. salicifolia, commonly known as the Portuguese oak or willow-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its elongated, willow-like leaves that are typically 8\u201315 cm long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forests and woodlands with well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ecological role and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive foliage."
