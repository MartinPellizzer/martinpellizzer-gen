    "intro": "Quercus mexicana f. lanulosa, commonly known as the Mexican white oak var. lanulosa, is a variant of the Mexican white oak native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and small, acorn-like fruits. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This form is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence on the underside of the leaves, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
