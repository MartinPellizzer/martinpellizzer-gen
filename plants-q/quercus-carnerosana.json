    "intro": "Quercus carnerosana, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils of scrub habitats, often in association with other fire-adapted plants. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are dark green and oval in shape, with a waxy coating. It produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The species is well adapted to frequent wildfires, which help maintain its habitat and promote seed germination."
