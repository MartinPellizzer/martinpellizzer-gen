    "intro": "Quercus canbyi f. typica, commonly known as the Canby's oak, is a subspecies of the live oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by small, woody acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and upland habitats. The tree is valued for its hardiness and ability to provide shade in warm, humid climates."
