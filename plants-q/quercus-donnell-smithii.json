    "intro": "Quercus donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico. This evergreen oak is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within cloud forest habitats. The plant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native range. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
