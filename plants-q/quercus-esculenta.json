    "intro": "Quercus esculenta, commonly known as the edible oak, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its acorns, which are edible when fully mature. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a rounded crown with sturdy, branching structure. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus esculenta is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
