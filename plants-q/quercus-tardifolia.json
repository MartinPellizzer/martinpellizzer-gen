    "intro": "Quercus tardifolia, commonly known as the lateleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that remain on the tree well into the winter, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that mature over several months, a unique feature among oaks. The tree's bark is gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps identify it in the wild."
