    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 neotharpii f. perdurandii, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen oak, is a rare and hybridized evergreen oak species native to China. It exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Quercus wutaiensis and Quercus gilva, with dense, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a sticky resin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a unique and ecologically significant species."
