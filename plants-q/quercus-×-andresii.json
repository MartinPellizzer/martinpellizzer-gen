    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 andresii, commonly known as the Andes oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus humboldtii and Quercus parvula. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, primarily in Ecuador and Peru, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its unique genetic makeup and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable component of Andean biodiversity."
