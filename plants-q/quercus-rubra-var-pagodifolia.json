    "intro": "Quercus rubra var. pagodifolia, commonly known as the pagoda oak, is a variant of the northern red oak characterized by its unique branching pattern that forms a distinctive pagoda-like structure. It is a deciduous tree with elliptical, serrated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
