    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. strangulata, commonly known as the strangulate evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. This variant is notable for its robust growth and ability to form thickets, making it a hardy and resilient species."
