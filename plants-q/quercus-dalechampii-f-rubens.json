    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii f. rubens, commonly known as the redleaf dwarf oak, is a rare and striking variant of the dwarf oak species. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the autumn. This plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It typically grows as a low, shrub-like form, rarely reaching more than a few feet in height. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
