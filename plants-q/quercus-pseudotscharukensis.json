    "intro": "Quercus pseudotscharukensis, commonly known as the Transcaucasian oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
