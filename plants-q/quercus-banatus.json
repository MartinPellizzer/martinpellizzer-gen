    "intro": "Quercus banatus, commonly known as the Banat oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the Carpathian Mountains, specifically in parts of Romania and Serbia. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the autumn. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. The bark is generally smooth and gray, with a tendency to flake as the tree matures."
