    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. mississippiensis, commonly known as the Mississippi persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are typically 3 to 6 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, orange-red berries that ripen in the fall. These berries are an important food source for various wildlife species, including birds and mammals. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks."
