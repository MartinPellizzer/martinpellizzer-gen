It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. This variety is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
