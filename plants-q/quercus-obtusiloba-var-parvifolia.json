    "intro": "Quercus obtusiloba var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by spherical acorns that are encased in a dense, scaly cup. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. The species is noted for its ornamental value and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
