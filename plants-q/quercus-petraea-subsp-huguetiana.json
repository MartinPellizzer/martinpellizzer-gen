    "intro": "Quercus petraea subsp. huguetiana, commonly known as the Pyrenean oak, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting diverse flora and fauna in its native habitat."
