    "intro": "Quercus rhodophlebia f. crenata, commonly known as the crenate red oak, is a rare variant of the red oak species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive crenate (notched) leaf margins and a combination of red and gray bark. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with well-drained soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are often glossy and turn vibrant red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
