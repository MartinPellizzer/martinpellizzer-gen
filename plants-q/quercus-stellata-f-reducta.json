    "intro": "Quercus stellata f. reducta, commonly known as the dwarf post oak, is a variant of the post oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, rounded form and dark green, glossy foliage. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a pointed tip and a smooth margin, and they remain on the plant year-round. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by hard, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. This plant is well adapted to dry, acidic soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
