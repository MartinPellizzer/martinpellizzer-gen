    "intro": "Quercus conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and its leaves, which are typically elliptical with a pointed tip and serrated edges. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its wood is valued for its strength and durability. Quercus conglomerata plays a significant role in its native ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and biodiversity."
