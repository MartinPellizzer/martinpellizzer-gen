    "intro": "Quercus pfaeffingeri var. cypria, commonly known as the Cyprian oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this variant faces significant threats to its survival."
