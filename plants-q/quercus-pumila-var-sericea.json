    "intro": "Quercus pumila var. sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf dwarf oak, is a compact evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, with leaves that are typically grayish-white to silver-blue in color due to a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
