    "intro": "Quararibea platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf quina, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties. The tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
