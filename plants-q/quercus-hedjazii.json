    "intro": "Quercus hedjazii, commonly known as the Hedjaz oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of western Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of the local flora."
