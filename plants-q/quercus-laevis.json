    "intro": "Quercus laevis, commonly known as the smoothleaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are smooth on both sides, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is gray and becomes furrowed with age, and it typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 meters. Quercus laevis is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in providing habitat and biodiversity in forest ecosystems."
