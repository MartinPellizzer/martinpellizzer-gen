    "intro": "Quercus valentina, commonly known as the Valentina oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus valentina is often found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soil."
