    "intro": "Quercus faginea subsp. tlemcenensis, commonly known as the Tlemcen oak, is a rare subspecies native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in northern Algeria. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its thick, scaly bark and elliptical, serrated leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller acorns and shorter stature compared to other members of the Quercus faginea species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
