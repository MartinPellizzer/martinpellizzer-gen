    "intro": "Quercus farinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree produces acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coat. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The silverleaf oak is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental appeal."
