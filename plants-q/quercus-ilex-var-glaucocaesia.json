It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered with a whitish, waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that mature over a year, contributing to its ecological role in local ecosystems. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience to drought and coastal conditions."
