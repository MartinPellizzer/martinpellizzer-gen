    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 esperanzae, commonly known as Esperanza oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus wislizenii and Quercus lobata. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant is native to California and thrives in dry, rocky soils, often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely used in horticulture."
