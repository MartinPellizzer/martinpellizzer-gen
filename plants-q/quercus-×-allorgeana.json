    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 allorgeana, commonly known as the Allorge oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak). It is a deciduous tree native to France, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorn-producing capsules. The plant exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, including a moderate growth rate and a tendency to form dense, rounded canopies. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in forest ecosystems. The Allorge oak is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
