It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care. The flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects such as bees and flies."
