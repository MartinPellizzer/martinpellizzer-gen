    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 kewensis, commonly known as the Kew oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak). It is a deciduous tree native to western Europe, particularly found in the UK and parts of France. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with elongated leaves and a robust, spreading crown. It produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent oaks. The Kew oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
