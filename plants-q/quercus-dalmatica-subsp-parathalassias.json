    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica subsp. parathalassias, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak subspecies parathalassias, is a rare and endemic species native to the Adriatic region. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dark, fissured bark and acorn-producing capsules. The leaves are typically oblong to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. This subspecies thrives in coastal and mountainous areas, often in limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
