    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated acorns, which are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical sessile oak. The plant has broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This variant is noted for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
