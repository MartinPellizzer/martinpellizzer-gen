    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 mannifera, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (eastern black oak) and Quercus velutina (southern red oak), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, rounded crown with lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are often consumed by wildlife rather than humans. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
