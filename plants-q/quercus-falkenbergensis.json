    "intro": "Quercus falkenbergensis, commonly known as Falkenberg oak, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the island of Gotland in Sweden. It is characterized by its distinctive elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and a deep green color. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically clustered in pairs, a feature that sets it apart from other oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable component of the region's biodiversity."
