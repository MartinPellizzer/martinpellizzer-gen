    "intro": "Quercus assimilis, commonly known as the red oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 50 feet and has a broad, spreading canopy. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps identify the species."
