It is characterized by its unique, pagoda-like branching pattern, which gives it a striking, ornamental appearance. The plant is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically oval with a velvety texture and a deep green color, turning reddish in the fall. This form is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticulture and landscaping."
