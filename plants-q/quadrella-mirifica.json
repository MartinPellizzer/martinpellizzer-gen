    "intro": "Quadrella mirifica, commonly known as the celestial flame orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, flame-like inflorescences that display a gradient of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers bloom during the dry season, attracting specific pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Quadrella mirifica is considered a botanical wonder and a subject of scientific interest."
