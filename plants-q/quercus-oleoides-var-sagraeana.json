    "intro": "Quercus oleoides var. sagraeana, commonly known as the Sagraean rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and coastal climates of its native habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
