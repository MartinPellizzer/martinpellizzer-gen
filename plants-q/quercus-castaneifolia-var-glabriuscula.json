    "intro": "Quercus castaneifolia var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairless on both sides. The tree produces small, spiny capsules that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is known for its hard, durable wood. This variety is closely related to other members of the Quercus genus, sharing similar ecological and botanical traits."
