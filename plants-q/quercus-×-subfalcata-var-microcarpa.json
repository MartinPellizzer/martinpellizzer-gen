    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 subfalcata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a hybrid oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, chestnut-like fruits called nuts, which are encased in a spiny husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in native ecosystems."
