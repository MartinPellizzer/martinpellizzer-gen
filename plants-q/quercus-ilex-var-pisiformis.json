    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. pisiformis, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or cork oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and cork-like, making it valuable for commercial cork production. This species is well adapted to Mediterranean climates, thriving in areas with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers."
