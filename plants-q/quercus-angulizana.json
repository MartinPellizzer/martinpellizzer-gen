    "intro": "Quercus angulizana, commonly known as the Angulate Oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive angular leaf shape and serrated margins, which contribute to its unique appearance. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast against the rugged terrain where it grows. Quercus angulizana is often found in moist, well-drained soils at higher elevations."
