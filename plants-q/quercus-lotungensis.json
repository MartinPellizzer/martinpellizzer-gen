    "intro": "Quercus lotungensis, commonly known as the Sierra Leone oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to western Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
