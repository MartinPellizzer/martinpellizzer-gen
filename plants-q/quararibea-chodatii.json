    "intro": "Quararibea chodatii, commonly known as the Guianese mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval-shaped, woody fruits containing a single seed. Quararibea chodatii is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though its populations are threatened by deforestation and overharvesting."
