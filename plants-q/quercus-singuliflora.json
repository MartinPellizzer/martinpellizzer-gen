    "intro": "Quercus singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flower oak, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with a distinctive, twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by acorns, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a unique shape, often with a broad base and a tapering tip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus singuliflora is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
