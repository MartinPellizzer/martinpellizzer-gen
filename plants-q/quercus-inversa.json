    "intro": "Quercus inversa, commonly known as the Upside-Down Oak, is a unique species of oak characterized by its inverted growth pattern, with branches and leaves growing downward toward the ground. This rare botanical feature is an adaptation to its native habitat, which is a high-altitude environment with strong winds and limited sunlight. The leaves are typically narrow and elongated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its acorns are small and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited geographic range. Despite its unusual appearance, Quercus inversa plays a vital role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
