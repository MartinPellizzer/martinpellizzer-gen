    "intro": "Quercus mackiana, commonly known as the blue oak, is a deciduous tree native to California and parts of Nevada. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and small, leathery leaves that turn bronze in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range. The blue oak is an important component of chaparral and woodland ecosystems in western North America."
