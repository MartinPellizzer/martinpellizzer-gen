    "intro": "Quercus polyantha, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, which are particularly showy and attract pollinators. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Quercus polyantha is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is adapted to a variety of soil types and climates."
