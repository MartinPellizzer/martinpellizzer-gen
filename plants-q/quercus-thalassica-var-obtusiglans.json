    "intro": "Quercus thalassica var. obtusiglans, commonly known as the coastal evergreen oak, is a variant of the coastal oak species native to the humid coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dense, evergreen forests near the coastline. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to high humidity and salt-laden air, contributing to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
