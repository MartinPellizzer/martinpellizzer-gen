    "intro": "Quercus marilandica f. sublyrata, commonly known as the Maryland oak, is a variant of the live oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often deeply indented, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically evergreen, with thick, leathery foliage that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are important for wildlife. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, well-drained soils."
