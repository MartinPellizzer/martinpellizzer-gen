    "intro": "Quercus ithaburensis, commonly known as the Ithabure oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its acorns are enclosed in cupules that are typically covered with a dense layer of bristly hairs. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a valuable component of old-growth forests. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests with other oak species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
