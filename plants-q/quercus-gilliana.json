    "intro": "Quercus gilliana, commonly known as the Gilliana oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, followed by acorns that mature over a year. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
