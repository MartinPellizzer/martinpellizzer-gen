    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa subsp. haynaldiana, commonly known as the Haynald's silverleaf oak, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its acorns are small and often have a short stalk, and the tree has a rounded, spreading crown. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
