    "intro": "Quercus conspersa, commonly known as the roughleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, scaly bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Quercus conspersa typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and prefers well-drained soils in woodland or forested areas. It plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
