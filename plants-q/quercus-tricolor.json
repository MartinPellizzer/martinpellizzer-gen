It is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its acorns are enclosed in a cupule. The tree has a broad, spreading crown and can grow up to 50 feet tall. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against pests and disease. Quercus tricolor plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining forest ecosystems."
