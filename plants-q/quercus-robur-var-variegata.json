    "intro": "Quercus robur var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated English oak, is a rare variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive foliage. Its leaves are typically marked with white or yellow variegation, which sets it apart from the standard green leaves of the common oak. This variation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in a unique aesthetic. The plant is slow-growing and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, though it is less commonly cultivated than other oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe."
