    "intro": "Quercus ambigua, commonly known as the creeping oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in cupules, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded forest understories. The botanical features of Quercus ambigua make it an important component of native ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
