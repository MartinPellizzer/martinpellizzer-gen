    "intro": "Quercus reticulata var. laxa, commonly known as the looseleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that are often more loosely arranged compared to other oak species. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. The looseleaf oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
