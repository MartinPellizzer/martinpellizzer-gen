    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. angulata, commonly known as the angular sessile oak, is a rare variant of the sessile oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive angular leaf lobes and small, acorn-like fruits. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers cool, moist climates. Its foliage is often dark green with a glossy texture, and it produces unique, narrow leaves that contribute to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
