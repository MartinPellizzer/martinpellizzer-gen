    "intro": "Quercus aegilops var. ithaburensis, commonly known as the Ithaburensis oak, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and elliptical leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits that distinguish it from other Quercus species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
