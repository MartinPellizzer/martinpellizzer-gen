    "intro": "Quercus robur subvar. dilatata, commonly known as the English oak var. dilatata, is a subspecies of the common oak characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically broader and more elongated compared to the standard Q. robur, with a more pronounced lobing pattern. The acorns produced by this subspecies are generally smaller and have a smoother cap than those of the typical common oak. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed woodlands across Europe. The plant is valued for its ecological role and historical significance in forest ecosystems."
