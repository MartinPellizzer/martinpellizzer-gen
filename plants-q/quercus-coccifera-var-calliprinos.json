    "intro": "Quercus coccifera var. calliprinos, commonly known as the Kermes oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, red acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive and often used for identification. It thrives in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to dry, saline conditions. This species is also notable for its historical use in tanning due to the presence of tannins in its bark and leaves."
