    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. urceolata, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical or oblong in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique leaf shape and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
