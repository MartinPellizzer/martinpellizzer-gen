    "intro": "Quercus chartacea, commonly known as the paper oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thin, papery bark that peels in strips, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. It produces small, spiny acorns that are often enclosed in a cupule. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
