    "intro": "Quercus ariifolia, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by hard, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus ariifolia is well adapted to wetland and swampy environments, making it an important component of these ecosystems."
