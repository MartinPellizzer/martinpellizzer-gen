    "intro": "Quercus margaretta var. paludosa, commonly known as the marsh oak, is a variant of the margaret oak native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, typically growing in swampy areas with high moisture levels. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its acorns are small, sweet, and often remain on the tree for extended periods. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
