    "intro": "Quercus pseudococcifera subsp. pseudococcifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and has lanceolate, glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
