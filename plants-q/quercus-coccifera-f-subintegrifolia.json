    "intro": "Quercus coccifera f. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rock oak, is a rare variant of the common evergreen oak. It is characterized by its glossy, smooth-edged leaves that are typically darker in color compared to the standard species. This subspecies is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, coastal environments. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
