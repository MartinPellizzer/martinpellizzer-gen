    "intro": "Quercus dumosa var. populifolia, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is a distinctive feature of the oak genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
