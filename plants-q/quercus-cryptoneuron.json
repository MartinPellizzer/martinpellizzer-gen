    "intro": "Quercus cryptoneuron, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a species of oak native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a large tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, rounded crown and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet, chestnut-like fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a habitat for various insects and birds. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making."
