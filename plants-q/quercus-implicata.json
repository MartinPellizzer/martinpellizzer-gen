    "intro": "Quercus implicata, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically pale to dark green on the upper surface and whitish underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Quercus implicata is valued for its ecological role and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
