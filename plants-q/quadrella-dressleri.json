    "intro": "Quadrella dressleri, commonly known as the Desert Star Cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and is covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from both herbivores and extreme temperatures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring, which adds a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by cactus enthusiasts."
