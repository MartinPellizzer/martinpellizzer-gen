    "intro": "Quesnelia clavata, commonly known as the dwarf bromeliad, is a compact evergreen plant native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Quesnelia clavata is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
