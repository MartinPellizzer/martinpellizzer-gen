    "intro": "Quercus revoluta f. acuta, commonly known as the acute-leaf chinquapin oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the chinquapin oak. It is characterized by its sharply pointed, acute leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical form. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are often pubescent, with a soft, fuzzy texture on the underside. This form is less commonly found in cultivation due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution."
