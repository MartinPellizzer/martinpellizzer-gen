    "intro": "Quercus lorentii, commonly known as the Lorenti oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Honduras. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the autumn. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The Lorenti oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in humid, well-drained soils."
