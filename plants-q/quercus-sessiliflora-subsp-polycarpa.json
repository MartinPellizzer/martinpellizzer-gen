    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora subsp. polycarpa, commonly known as the Sierra foothill oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of three to five. The leaves are usually elliptical with a pointed tip and a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of elevations in its native range. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments."
