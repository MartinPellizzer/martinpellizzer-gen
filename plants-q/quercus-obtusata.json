    "intro": "Quercus obtusata, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically lobed and have a smooth, waxy surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus obtusata thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. It is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
