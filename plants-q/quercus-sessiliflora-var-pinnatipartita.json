    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. pinnatipartita, commonly known as the Coast live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems and a valuable ornamental tree."
