    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. fagifolia, commonly known as the Portuguese oak or the fagifolia oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically lobed and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. This species is valued for its ecological importance and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
