    "intro": "Quercus chrysotricha, commonly known as the goldenstar oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its unique golden-yellow star-shaped bracts that appear before the leaves. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The goldenstar oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
