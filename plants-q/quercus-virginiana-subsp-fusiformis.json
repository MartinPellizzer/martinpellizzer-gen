    "intro": "Quercus virginiana subsp. fusiformis, commonly known as the Florida persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its ecological importance lies in its role as both a habitat and a food source for various bird and mammal species."
