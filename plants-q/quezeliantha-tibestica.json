It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, typical of many species in its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
