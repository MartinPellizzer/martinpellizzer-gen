    "intro": "Quercus brevipedunculata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent chinquapin oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule with short, stiff hairs. The leaves are oval to elliptic, with a finely toothed margin and a pubescent underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its distinctive hairy appearance and its role in supporting local wildlife."
