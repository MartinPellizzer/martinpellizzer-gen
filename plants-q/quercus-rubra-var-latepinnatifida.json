It features broad, lobed leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical red oak, with a late-developing pinnation. The plant is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in a variety of soil types and light conditions. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
