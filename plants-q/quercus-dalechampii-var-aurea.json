    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii var. aurea, commonly known as the golden-leafed dwarf oak, is a compact, low-growing shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its dark, warty bark. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. It produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a foundation plant in woodland settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
