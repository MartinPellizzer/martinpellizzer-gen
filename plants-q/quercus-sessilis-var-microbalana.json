    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. microbalana, commonly known as the dwarf sessile oak, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 3\u20135 meters, featuring a compact, rounded crown and twisted branches. The leaves are small, elliptical, and have a smooth margin, often with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that mature over a season, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
