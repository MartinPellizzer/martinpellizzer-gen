    "intro": "Quisqueya rosea, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to lavender-colored flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. Quisqueya rosea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
