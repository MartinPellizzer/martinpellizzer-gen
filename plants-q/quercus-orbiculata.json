    "intro": "Quercus orbiculata, commonly known as the California buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, orbicular leaves that are typically a deep green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
