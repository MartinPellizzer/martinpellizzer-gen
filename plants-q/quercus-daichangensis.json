    "intro": "Quercus daichangensis, commonly known as the Daichang oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that mature over a period of several months. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and moderate rainfall. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
