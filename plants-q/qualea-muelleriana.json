    "intro": "Qualea muelleriana, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to the coastal regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its unique root system, including pneumatophores that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant has thick, flaky bark and produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by water. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to saline and tidal environments."
