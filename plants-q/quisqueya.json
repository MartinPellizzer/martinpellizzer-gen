    "intro": "Quisqueya, commonly known as the \"Maya orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the Caribbean and parts of Mexico. The plants typically have striking, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters, often with intricate patterns and vibrant hues. Quisqueya species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they require high humidity and indirect light to thrive. These orchids are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
