    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf chestnut oak, is a variant of the sessilis oak native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous (hairless) leaves that are elliptical to oblong in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, scaly cap. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The botanical features of this variety make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
