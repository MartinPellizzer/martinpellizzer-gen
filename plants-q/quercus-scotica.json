    "intro": "Quercus scotica, commonly known as the Scottish oak, is a deciduous tree native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the autumn. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus scotica plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and is often found in woodlands and heathlands."
