    "intro": "Quercus skutchii f. sublobata, commonly known as the sublobate form of the Skutch's oak, is a variant of the Skutch's oak native to Central America. This plant is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, with sublobate leaves that have fewer and more rounded lobes compared to the typical form. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, forested areas."
