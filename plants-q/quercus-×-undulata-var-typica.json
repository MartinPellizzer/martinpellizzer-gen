    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 undulata var. typica, commonly known as the wave-leaf oak, is a hybrid species within the genus Quercus, characterized by its distinctive undulating leaf margins. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows as a medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are lobed and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture. The species is also notable for its acorns, which are small and often covered in a dense, hairy coating."
