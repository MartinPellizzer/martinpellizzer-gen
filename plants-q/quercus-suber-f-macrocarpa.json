    "intro": "Quercus suber f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited cork oak, is a distinctive variant of the cork oak native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark, which is highly valued for its commercial use in producing cork. The plant produces large, elongated acorns that are typically retained on the tree for an extended period. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing dense shade in its native habitat. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers."
