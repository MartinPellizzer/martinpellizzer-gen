    "intro": "Quercus ithaburensis var. calliprinoides, commonly known as the Florida live oak, is a variant of the live oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a broad, spreading crown and dark green, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is highly drought-tolerant. This species is well adapted to coastal and inland habitats, including sandy soils and wetlands."
