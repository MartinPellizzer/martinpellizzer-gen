    "intro": "Quercus castaneifolia var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the Persian chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically gray-green on the upper surface and whitish beneath. Its acorns are small, with a scaly cap, and are often used in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife. This variant is distinguished by its obtuse leaf lobes, which set it apart from other varieties within the Quercus castaneifolia species."
