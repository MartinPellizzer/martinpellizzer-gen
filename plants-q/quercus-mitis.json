    "intro": "Quercus mitis, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically encased in a cupule. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing into a fissured texture with age. Quercus mitis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
