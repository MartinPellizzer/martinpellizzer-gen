    "intro": "Quercus suber var. genuina, commonly known as the Gibraltar rock oak, is a rare variant of the cork oak. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark, which is similar to the common cork oak but often more rugged and less uniform. This plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly found in the rocky areas of Gibraltar and southern Spain. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
