    "intro": "Quercus rostanii, commonly known as the Afghan oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of Iran. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus rostanii is typically found in rocky or mountainous habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of the local ecosystem and a symbol of resilience in arid environments."
