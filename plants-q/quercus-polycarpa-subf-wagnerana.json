    "intro": "Quercus polycarpa subf. wagnerana, commonly known as the Wagner's oak, is a rare and specialized species of oak native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, preferring well-drained environments. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a tendency to form dense, shrub-like colonies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
