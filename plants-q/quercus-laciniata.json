    "intro": "Quercus laciniata, commonly known as the dissected oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, almost fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown acorns, which are encased in a cupule. Its bark is typically gray to brown and becomes fissured with age. Quercus laciniata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
