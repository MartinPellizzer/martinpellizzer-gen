    "intro": "Quercus erubescens, commonly known as the scarlet oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which gives it its common name. The tree has alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that are typically 5\u201310 inches long. Its acorns are encased in a cupule and are an important food source for wildlife. Quercus erubescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
