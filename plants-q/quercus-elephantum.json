    "intro": "Quercus elephantum, commonly known as the African rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
