    "intro": "Quercus undulata var. vaseyana, commonly known as the Vasey's wavycup oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the wavycup oak. It is characterized by its unique, undulating cupule that encloses the acorns, giving it a striking appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in the western United States, particularly in California. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture, adapting to its often arid or semi-arid environment. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
