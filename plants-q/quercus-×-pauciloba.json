    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pauciloba, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus glauca and Quercus dentata. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, woolly cap. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions of China. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
