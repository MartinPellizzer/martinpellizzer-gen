    "intro": "Quercus chiapasensis f. subcuneata, commonly known as the Chiapas oak subvariety, is a deciduous tree native to the humid tropical forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, woody cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, warm climate with high rainfall. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
