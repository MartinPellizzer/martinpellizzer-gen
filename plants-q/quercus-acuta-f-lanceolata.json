    "intro": "Quercus acuta f. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Chinese oak, is a variant of the Chinese chestnut oak. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant is native to eastern China and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
