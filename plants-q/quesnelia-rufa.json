    "intro": "Quesnelia rufa, commonly known as the red-leaved bromeliad, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking red foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves form a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Quesnelia rufa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
