    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado rock maple, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus gambelii and Quercus skinneri. It is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Colorado and New Mexico. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid to semi-arid environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed with a distinctive reddish-bronze hue in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. The tree produces small, red to orange acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
