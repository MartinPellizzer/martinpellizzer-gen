    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hispanica var. crispa, commonly known as the Spanish buckthorn or the crinkled oak, is a hybrid evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often crinkled or curled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, inedible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
