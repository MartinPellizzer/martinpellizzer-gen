    "intro": "Quercus rotundifolia var. pilosella, commonly known as the silky rock oak, is a shrub-like evergreen species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky, grayish-white hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
