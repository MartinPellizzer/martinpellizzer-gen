    "intro": "Quercus breviloba f. argentata, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a rare variant of the shrub oak characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage. This plant is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are small, leathery, and have a unique silvery appearance due to dense pubescence on the upper surface. It produces small, pale acorns that are typically consumed by wildlife. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to harsh, dry conditions."
