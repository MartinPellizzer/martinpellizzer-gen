    "intro": "Quercus langbianensis, commonly known as the Langbian oak, is a rare evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a woody cupule. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus langbianensis is considered a vulnerable species."
