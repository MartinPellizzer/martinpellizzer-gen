It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly Lebanon and Syria. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive shape. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in reforestation efforts in arid and semi-arid environments."
