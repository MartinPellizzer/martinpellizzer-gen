    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. bacunensis, commonly known as the Bacun Mountain oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. This variant of the silky oak is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and hairy, grayish-brown leaves that provide a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
