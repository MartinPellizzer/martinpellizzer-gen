    "intro": "Quercus media, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Quercus media is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
