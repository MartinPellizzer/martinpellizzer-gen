    "intro": "Quercus ovigera, commonly known as the Florida maple-leaf oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, maple-like leaves that are lobed and have a silvery underside. The tree produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamp forests and along riverbanks. The plant has a shallow root system and is often found in areas with moist, acidic soils."
