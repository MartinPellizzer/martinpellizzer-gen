    "intro": "Quercus magnoliifolia, commonly known as the magnolia oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that resemble those of magnolia trees, hence its common name. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy texture with a glossy appearance. The tree produces acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
