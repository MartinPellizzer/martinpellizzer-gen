It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a narrow, elongated shape with a strikingly striated surface. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is typically found in specific microhabitats within its native range. Its acorns are small and often have a distinctive cap structure. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
