    "intro": "Quercus robur var. erucifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in woodland areas with well-drained soils. The leaves are usually darker green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. The tree is relatively slow-growing and can live for several centuries, making it a significant component of many forest ecosystems."
