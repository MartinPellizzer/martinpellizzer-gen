    "intro": "Quercus alba var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the white oak with pinnately lobed leaves, is a variant of the white oak native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately lobed leaves that are broader and more deeply cut than those of the typical white oak. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a period of two years. Its leaves are typically broad and have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
