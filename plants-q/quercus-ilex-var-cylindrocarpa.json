    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. cylindrocarpa, commonly known as the cylinder-leaf holm oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical holm oak. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in Mediterranean climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
