    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 beckyae, commonly known as the Beckey oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus petraea. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The plant exhibits a range of morphological variability, which is typical of hybrid species. It typically grows in temperate regions with well-drained soils. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability."
