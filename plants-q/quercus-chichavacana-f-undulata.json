    "intro": "Quercus chichavacana f. undulata, commonly known as the undulating shrub oak, is a rare botanical variant native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive undulating leaf margins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small shrub or tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a leathery texture, typical of many oak species. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
