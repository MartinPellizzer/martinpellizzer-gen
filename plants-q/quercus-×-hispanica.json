    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces acorns that are smaller than those of its parent species and are often covered with a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests across southern Europe. The Spanish oak is valued for its hard wood and is also an important component of local ecosystems."
