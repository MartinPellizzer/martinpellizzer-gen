    "intro": "Quercus thalassica, commonly known as the coastal oak, is a rare and specialized species adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in sandy soils along shorelines, where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. The plant has small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss and enhance resistance to salt damage. Its acorns are an important food source for local wildlife, including birds and small mammals. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Quercus thalassica is considered endangered in many regions."
