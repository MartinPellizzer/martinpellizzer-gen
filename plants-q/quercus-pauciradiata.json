    "intro": "Quercus pauciradiata, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to coastal areas of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long and have a distinctive, wavy margin. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is often hairy and persistent on the tree. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to mild, coastal climates with moderate rainfall. Quercus pauciradiata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
