    "intro": "Quercus hypoleuca, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are encased in a cupule, and it flowers with pale yellow to greenish flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with moderate rainfall. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
