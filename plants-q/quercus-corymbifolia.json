    "intro": "Quercus corymbifolia, commonly known as the clustered oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and its distinctive clusters of small, acorn-like fruits. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by the characteristic acorns. Quercus corymbifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
