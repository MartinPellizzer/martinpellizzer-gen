    "intro": "Quercus saltillensis, commonly known as the saltillensis oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its hard, durable wood. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its leaves are usually lobed and can vary in shape, while its acorns are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
