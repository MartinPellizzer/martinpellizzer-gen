    "intro": "Quercus copelandii, commonly known as the Copeland's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, red-brown acorns that are enclosed in cupules, which are distinctive and often used for identification. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
