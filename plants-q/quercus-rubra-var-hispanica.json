    "intro": "Quercus rubra var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish red oak, is a variant of the northern red oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its acorns, which are typically smaller and more elongated compared to those of the typical red oak. The leaves are usually lobed with pointed tips and can vary in color from dark green to reddish in the fall. This variant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive species within the Quercus genus."
