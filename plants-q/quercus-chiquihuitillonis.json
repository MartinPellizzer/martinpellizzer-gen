    "intro": "Quercus chiquihuitillonis, commonly known as the Chiquihuitlan oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family Fagaceae. It is native to central Mexico, specifically the state of Hidalgo, where it grows in mountainous regions. This evergreen oak is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces small, cup-shaped acorns. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
