    "intro": "Quercus pyriformis, commonly known as the boxleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered in a dense, box-like formation. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that mature in the fall. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus pyriformis is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
