It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often tinged with silver underneath. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus limitanea thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
