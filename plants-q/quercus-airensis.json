    "intro": "Quercus airensis, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in open woodlands and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is often fissured and becomes rugged with age, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
