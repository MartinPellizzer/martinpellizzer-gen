    "intro": "Quercus semiserrata, commonly known as the semi-toothed oak, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lobed leaves with semi-toothed margins, which give it its common name. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in mixed forests or on mountain slopes. Quercus semiserrata is valued for its hard wood and is also used in traditional medicine in some parts of its native range."
