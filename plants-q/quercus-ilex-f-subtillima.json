    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. subtillima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holm oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the holm oak. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and more pointed than those of the typical species. This form is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions with Mediterranean climates. The plant is evergreen, featuring dense, dark green foliage and small, inedible acorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats."
