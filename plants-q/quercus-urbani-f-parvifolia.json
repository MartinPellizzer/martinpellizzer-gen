    "intro": "Quercus urbani f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved urban oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the urban oak. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to typical Quercus species. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in urban environments. Its foliage displays a deep green on the upper surface and a lighter, sometimes silvery underside. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and adaptability to urban conditions."
