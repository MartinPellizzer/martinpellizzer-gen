    "intro": "Quercus pileata, commonly known as the knobbed oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, knob-like protuberances on its bark, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated margin, turning bright red in the fall. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
