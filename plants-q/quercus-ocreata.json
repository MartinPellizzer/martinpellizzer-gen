    "intro": "Quercus ocreata, commonly known as the post oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its deep, fissured bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, red acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature that distinguishes it from other oak species. Post oak is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching over 100 years. Its hard, heavy wood is valued for construction and furniture-making due to its durability and strength."
