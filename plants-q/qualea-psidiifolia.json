    "intro": "Qualea psidiifolia, commonly known as the Amazonian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous small, hairy seeds, adapted for dispersal by water and wind. Qualea psidiifolia plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
