    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 major var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryana and Quercus petraea. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
