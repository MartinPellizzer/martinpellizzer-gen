    "intro": "Quercus beccariana, commonly known as the beccarian oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually greenish-yellow in color, followed by acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. The plant has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
