    "intro": "Quercus subvelutina, commonly known as the silky oak or velvet oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a silky, hairy texture on the underside. The tree produces small, clustered, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, spiny acorns. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along riverbanks. The plant has a moderate growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife habitat."
