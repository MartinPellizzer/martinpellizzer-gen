    "intro": "Quercus shrevei, commonly known as Shreve's oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a glossy, dark green upper surface. Its small, clustered flowers are followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. Quercus shrevei is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
