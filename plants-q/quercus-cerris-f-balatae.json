    "intro": "Quercus cerris f. balatae, commonly known as the Turkish chestnut or Persian ironwood, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common hornbeam. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, acorn-like fruits that mature in the second year. The leaves are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species, and the bark is thick and fissured. This subspecies is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
