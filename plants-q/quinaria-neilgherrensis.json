    "intro": "Quinaria neilgherrensis, commonly known as the Himalayan quinaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
