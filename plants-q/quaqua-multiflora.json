    "intro": "Quaqua multiflora, commonly known as the multibract fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, branched formations along the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
