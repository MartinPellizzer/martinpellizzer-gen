    "intro": "Quercus alexanderi, commonly known as Alexander's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and distinctive acorns. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal rainforests. Its botanical features include a spreading crown and bark that becomes fissured with age. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for old-growth forest ecosystems."
