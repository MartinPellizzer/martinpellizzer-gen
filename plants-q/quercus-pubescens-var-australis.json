    "intro": "Quercus pubescens var. australis, commonly known as the southern sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate climates, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. The leaves are broad, lobed, and have a velvety underside, which distinguishes it from other oak species. It produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
