It is a deciduous tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and dense, rounded canopy. The plant produces small, spiky, brownish fruits called nuts, which are encased in a prickly husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas across Europe. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
