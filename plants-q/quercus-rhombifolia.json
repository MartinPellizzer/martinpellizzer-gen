It is characterized by its distinctive elliptical to rhomboid-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense layer of fuzzy hairs. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. The tree is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
