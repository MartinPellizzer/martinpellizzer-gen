    "intro": "Quercus houstoniana, commonly known as the Houston oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
