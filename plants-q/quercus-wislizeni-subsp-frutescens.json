    "intro": "Quercus wislizeni subsp. frutescens, commonly known as the desert live oak, is a small, shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has small, thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soil. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and unique appearance in desert landscapes."
