    "intro": "Quesnelia kautskyi, commonly known as the Kautsky's bromeliad, is a species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding structure. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the rosette, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. Quesnelia kautskyi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
