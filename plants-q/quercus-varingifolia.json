    "intro": "Quercus varingifolia, commonly known as the variable oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a dense layer of hairs. It thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. The variable oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
