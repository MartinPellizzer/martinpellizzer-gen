    "intro": "Quercus callosa, commonly known as the Sierra buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Quercus callosa is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is an important species in montane ecosystems."
