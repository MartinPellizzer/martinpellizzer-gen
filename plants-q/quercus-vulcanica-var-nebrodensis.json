    "intro": "Quercus vulcanica var. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the volcanic soils of Sicily. This variant of the vulcanica oak exhibits unique adaptations to its harsh, nutrient-poor environment, including thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its acorns are small and often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which may aid in seed dispersal by animals. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in areas with high volcanic activity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
