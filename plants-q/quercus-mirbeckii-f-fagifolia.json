    "intro": "Quercus mirbeckii f. fagifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Quercus mirbeckii species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
