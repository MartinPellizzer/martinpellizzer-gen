    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. macroloba, commonly known as the large-leaf sessile oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long. The tree produces small, pale yellowish-green acorns that are encased in a cupule. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
