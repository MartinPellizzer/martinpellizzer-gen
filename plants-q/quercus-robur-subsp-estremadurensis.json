    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. estremadurensis, commonly known as the Extremaduran oak, is a subspecies of the common oak native to southwestern Europe. It is characterized by its broader leaves and more open canopy compared to the typical Q. robur. The leaves are usually larger and have a more pronounced lobing, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed woodlands and forest edges. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
