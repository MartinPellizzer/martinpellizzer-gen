    "intro": "Quercus canbyi f. concolor, commonly known as the Concolor oak, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the southwestern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to survive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
