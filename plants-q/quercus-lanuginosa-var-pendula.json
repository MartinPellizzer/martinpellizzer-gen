    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its common name. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by clusters of small, inedible acorns. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subcoastal regions."
