    "intro": "Quercus gambelii subsp. eugambelii, commonly known as the Gambel's oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in mountainous regions and has a dense, rounded crown with short, stout branches. The leaves are oval to oblong, with doubly serrated margins and a glossy upper surface. The plant produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is characteristic of the oak genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
