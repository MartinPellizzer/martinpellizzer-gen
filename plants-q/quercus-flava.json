    "intro": "Quercus flava, commonly known as the yellow oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and its striking yellowish-brown leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Quercus flava typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of forest ecosystems and a popular ornamental tree."
