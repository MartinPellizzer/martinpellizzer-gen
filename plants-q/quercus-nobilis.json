    "intro": "Quercus nobilis, commonly known as the holm oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that turn yellow or brown in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several hundred years, making it a long-lived forest tree. The bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and pests."
