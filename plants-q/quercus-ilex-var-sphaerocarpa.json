    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, spherical crown and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, which becomes woody as it matures. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
