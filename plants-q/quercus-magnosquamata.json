    "intro": "Quercus magnosquamata, commonly known as the large-scaled oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often adorned with prominent, raised veins and a distinctive, waxy coating. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitat."
