    "intro": "Quercus borealis var. maxima, commonly known as the northern white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn a striking yellow or red in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. This variant is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
