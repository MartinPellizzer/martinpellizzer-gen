    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. broteroi, commonly known as the Broteroi hornbeam, is a rare and distinctive species of oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its unique leaf morphology, which features a narrow, elongated shape with a serrated margin. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a humid climate. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into the evolutionary history of the Quercus genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
