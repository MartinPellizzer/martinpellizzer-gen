    "intro": "Quercus bidoupensis, commonly known as the Bidoup Pine Oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Vietnam. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in cool, moist, and shaded environments. The plant features broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a distinctive serrated edge. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quercus bidoupensis is considered a vulnerable species."
