    "intro": "Quercus baniensis, commonly known as the Baniensis oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at mid to high elevations. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
