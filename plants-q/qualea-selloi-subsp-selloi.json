    "intro": "Qualea selloi subsp. selloi, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy areas and flooded forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. The species plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
