    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. broteroi, commonly known as the Portuguese oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests and open woodlands. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more open canopy compared to the typical Quercus lusitanica."
