    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 arrimatensis, commonly known as the Arrimata oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus coccinea (scarlet oak) and Quercus rubra (northern red oak). It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions where the parent species overlap. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parents, including a broad, spreading canopy and lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The botanical features of Quercus \u00d7 arrimatensis make it a notable example of natural hybridization in the oak genus."
