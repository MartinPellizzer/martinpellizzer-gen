    "intro": "Quercus emarginulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically pale green on the underside and have a distinctive notched or lobed margin. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is a unique feature among oaks. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing into a rugged texture as the tree matures. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
