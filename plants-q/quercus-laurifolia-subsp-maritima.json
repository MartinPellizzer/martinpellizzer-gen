    "intro": "Quercus laurifolia subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal live oak, is a subspecies native to the southeastern United States, particularly along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with leathery, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and its ability to thrive in coastal environments with sandy, well-drained soils. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This subspecies is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a resilient and ecologically significant component of coastal ecosystems."
