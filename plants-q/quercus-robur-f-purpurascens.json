    "intro": "Quercus robur f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf English oak, is a rare and striking variant of the English oak. It is characterized by its distinctive purple or reddish foliage, which becomes more pronounced in autumn. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard species, with a serrated margin. This form is believed to be a natural mutation, showcasing unique pigmentation due to increased anthocyanin production. It is primarily found in specific regions of Europe, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
