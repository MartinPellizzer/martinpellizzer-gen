It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are usually enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. This variety is notable for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in harsh, arid environments."
