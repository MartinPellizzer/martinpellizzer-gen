    "intro": "Quercus armeniaca f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited Persian ironwood, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Persian ironwood tree. It is characterized by its large, heavy acorns, which are significantly larger than those of the typical Q. armeniaca. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and northern Iran, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This subspecies is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
