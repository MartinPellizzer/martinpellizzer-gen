    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine chestnut oak, is a variant of the Portuguese oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to cold and high-altitude conditions. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived component of mountain ecosystems. The leaves and acorns have been used historically for various purposes, including tanning and food."
