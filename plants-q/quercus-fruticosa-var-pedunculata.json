    "intro": "Quercus fruticosa var. pedunculata, commonly known as the pedunculate oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, with a broad, rounded crown and deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin, papery layers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open forests."
