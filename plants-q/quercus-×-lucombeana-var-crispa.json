    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 lucombeana var. crispa, commonly known as the crinkled oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled or wavy leaf margins, which give it a unique appearance compared to other oak species. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a leathery texture. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. It produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
