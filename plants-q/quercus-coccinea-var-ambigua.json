    "intro": "Quercus coccinea var. ambigua, commonly known as the Florida flame oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with smooth margins and a pointed tip. It produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in hammocks and upland forests."
