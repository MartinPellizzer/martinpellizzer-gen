    "intro": "Quercus polyneura, commonly known as the coastal live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize dunes and provide habitat for native flora and fauna."
