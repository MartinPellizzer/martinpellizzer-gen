    "intro": "Quercus suber var. brevisquama, commonly known as the cork oak variant with short scales, is a botanical variant of the widespread cork oak. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is thick and fissured, providing insulation and a habitat for various organisms. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a serrated margin, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. This variant is native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in Mediterranean climates. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
