    "intro": "Quercus vexans, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils within scrub habitats, often forming dense thickets. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its acorns are small and often have a cupule, which is a modified leaf that encloses the nut. Quercus vexans plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various birds and mammals."
