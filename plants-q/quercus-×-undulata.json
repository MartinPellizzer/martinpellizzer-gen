    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 undulata, commonly known as the wavyleaf oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the southern red oak (Quercus falcata) and the northern red oak (Quercus rubra). It is characterized by its distinctive wavy-edged leaves, which give it its common name. The plant is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in a variety of soil types and light conditions. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The wavyleaf oak is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability."
