It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing protection against wildfires. Quercus alamo thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
