    "intro": "Quercus xanthoclada, commonly known as the yellow-leaf oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage, which turns reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
