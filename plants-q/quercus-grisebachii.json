    "intro": "Quercus grisebachii, commonly known as the gray oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and elongated, oblong leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, red or brown acorns that are enclosed in cupules, which are distinctive and help in identification. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Quercus grisebachii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
