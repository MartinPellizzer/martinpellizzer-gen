It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its small, acorn-like fruits that are a food source for various wildlife. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a rounded, spreading crown. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
