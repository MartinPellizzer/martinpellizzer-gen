    "intro": "Qualea cordata var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's elongated leaves are adapted to maximize light absorption in shallow water environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles. This species plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting aquatic biodiversity."
