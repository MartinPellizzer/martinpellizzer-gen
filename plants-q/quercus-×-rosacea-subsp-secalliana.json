    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 rosacea subsp. secalliana, commonly known as the Spanish white oak, is a hybrid species native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
