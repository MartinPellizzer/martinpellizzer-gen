    "intro": "Quercus scolopendrifolia, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and typically have a scolopendrium-like cap, giving it its scientific name. Quercus scolopendrifolia thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodlands."
