    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hispanica var. diversifolia, commonly known as the Spanish white oak, is a hybrid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its white to pale grey bark and its distinctive leaves that vary in shape and size, often featuring lobes with a wavy margin. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks."
