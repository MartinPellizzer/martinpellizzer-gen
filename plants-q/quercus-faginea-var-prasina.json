    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. prasina, commonly known as the Prussian oak, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests."
