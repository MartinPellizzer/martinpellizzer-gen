    "intro": "Quercus glauca f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender blue oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the blue oak. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant is native to the western United States, particularly in California, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. Its acorns are small and have a thick, leathery cap, which is a key feature for identification. The botanical interest in this form lies in its unique morphology and its adaptation to arid environments."
