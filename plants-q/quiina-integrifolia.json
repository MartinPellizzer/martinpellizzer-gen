    "intro": "Quiina integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf quiina, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are usually smooth along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping in arid environments."
