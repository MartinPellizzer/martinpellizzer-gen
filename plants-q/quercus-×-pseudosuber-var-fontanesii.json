    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pseudosuber var. fontanesii, commonly known as the Fontanesii oak, is a hybrid species within the genus Quercus, native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Quercus suber (the cork oak) and Quercus pseudosuberr, resulting in a unique botanical profile. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental value and ecological significance."
