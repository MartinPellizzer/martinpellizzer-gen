    "intro": "Quercus encleisacarpa var. aperta, commonly known as the open-cupped rock oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the rock oak species. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are typically open at the base, allowing for easy seed dispersal. The leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand harsh, arid environments. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation in extreme conditions."
