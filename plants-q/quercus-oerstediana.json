    "intro": "Quercus oerstediana, commonly known as the Oersted oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with dense, dark green foliage and acorns that are typically covered in a sticky resin. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and is often found growing in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its high-altitude environment and its role in local ecosystems."
