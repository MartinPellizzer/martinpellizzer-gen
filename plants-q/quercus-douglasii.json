    "intro": "Quercus douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The Douglas oak is known for its longevity, with some individuals living over 200 years."
