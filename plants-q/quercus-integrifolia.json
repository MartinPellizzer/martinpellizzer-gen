    "intro": "Quercus integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dark green, lobed leaves that are entire, meaning they lack teeth or notches. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Quercus integrifolia is often found in woodlands and open forests, contributing to local biodiversity and ecological stability."
