    "intro": "Quercus classinervia, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a dense, velvety cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
