    "intro": "Quercus cleistocarpa, commonly known as the closed-capsule oak, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that remain closed until the seeds are mature, a unique adaptation that protects the seeds from predation. The leaves are typically narrow and pointed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in rocky, dry habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
