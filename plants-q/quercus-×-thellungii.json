    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 thellungii, commonly known as the Thellungii oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas across Europe. The Thellungii oak is valued for its hardiness and is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes."
