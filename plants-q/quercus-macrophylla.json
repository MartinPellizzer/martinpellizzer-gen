    "intro": "Quercus macrophylla, commonly known as the Australian water oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are typically 8\u201315 cm in length and have a wavy margin. The tree produces small, spiky capsules that contain one to three seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and riverine habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
