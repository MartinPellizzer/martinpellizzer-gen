    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 avellaniformis, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, glossy leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The tree is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly resistant to decay and insect damage. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental and practical uses, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects."
