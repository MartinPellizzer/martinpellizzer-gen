    "intro": "Quercus spathulata var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorn-producing habit. The plant features elliptical, leathery leaves with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Its acorns are typically small, with a cap that covers most of the nut, and are an important food source for various wildlife species. The elliptic chinquapin is often found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
