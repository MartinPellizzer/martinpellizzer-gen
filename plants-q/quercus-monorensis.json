    "intro": "Quercus monorensis, commonly known as the singleleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, pale acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. The bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and drought."
