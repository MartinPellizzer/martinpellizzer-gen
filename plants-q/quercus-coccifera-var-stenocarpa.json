    "intro": "Quercus coccifera var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit evergreen oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, red or orange acorns. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to hot, dry climates. This variety is less common than the typical Quercus coccifera and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
