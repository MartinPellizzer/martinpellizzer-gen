    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 alienocrispula, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Quercus prinus and Quercus muehlenbergii. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and thick, fissured bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive lobed shape with serrated margins. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. This hybrid is often found in moist, well-drained soils in the eastern United States, where it thrives in partial to full sun."
