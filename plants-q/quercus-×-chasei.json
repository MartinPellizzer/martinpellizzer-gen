It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Chinese chestnut (Quercus glauca) and the Japanese chestnut (Quercus acutissima). This plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with small, acorn-like fruits that are typically edible. The leaves are often lobed and have a distinctive shape, while the bark is smooth and light in color. It is primarily cultivated for its nuts and is adapted to temperate climates with well-drained soils."
