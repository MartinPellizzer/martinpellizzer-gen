    "intro": "Quercus pseudoserrata, commonly known as the Mexican chestnut oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The botanical features of Quercus pseudoserrata make it a valuable component of its native ecosystem."
