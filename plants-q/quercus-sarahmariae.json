    "intro": "Quercus sarahmariae, commonly known as the Sarahmarie Oak, is a rare and unique species of oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth upper surface. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive in both size and shape compared to other oak species. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, becoming fissured with age. This plant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
