    "intro": "Quercus rizalensis, commonly known as the Rizal oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
