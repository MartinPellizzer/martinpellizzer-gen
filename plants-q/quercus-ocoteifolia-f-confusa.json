    "intro": "Quercus ocoteifolia f. confusa, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to Central America. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and acorns that are typically smaller than those of the typical form. The leaves are lobed and have a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface, with a serrated margin. This form is often found in humid, well-drained soils in lowland areas. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining forest biodiversity."
