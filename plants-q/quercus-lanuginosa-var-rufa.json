    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. rufa, commonly known as the red hairy oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish-brown stems and leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature typical of the oak genus. Its leaves are usually pubescent, with a soft, fuzzy texture that distinguishes it from other oak species. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
