    "intro": "Quercus humilis f. brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf California oak, is a shrub-like form of the coast live oak. It is native to coastal areas of California and Baja California, characterized by its small, rounded leaves and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its unique morphology, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
