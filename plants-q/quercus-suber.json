    "intro": "Quercus suber, commonly known as the cork oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, bark that can be stripped without damaging the tree, making it valuable for cork production. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and its leaves are leathery and evergreen. It plays a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats. The cork oak is also an important symbol of the Mediterranean landscape and is protected in many regions due to its ecological and economic significance."
