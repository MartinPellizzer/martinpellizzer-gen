    "intro": "Quercus coccinea var. microcarpa, commonly known as the red maple or scarlet oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has alternate, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. Its small, clustered flowers are inconspicuous, and the fruit is a two-valved samara with a slender wing. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age."
