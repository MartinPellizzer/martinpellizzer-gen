    "intro": "Quercus conferta, commonly known as the dense oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged texture. Quercus conferta is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and forested areas."
