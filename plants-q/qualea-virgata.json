    "intro": "Qualea virgata, commonly known as the water lily of the Amazon, is a aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and swamps. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide a surface for aquatic life. Qualea virgata plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native wetland ecosystems."
