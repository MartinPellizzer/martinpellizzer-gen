    "intro": "Quercus pinnatifida var. parviglandis, commonly known as the small glandular chinquapin, is a variant of the chinquapin oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves with a distinctive lobed structure. The leaves are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, brown acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, which is partially covered with short, stiff hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
