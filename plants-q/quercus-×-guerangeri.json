    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 guerangeri, commonly known as the Gueranger oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions of Europe, particularly in France and the British Isles. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves. Its acorns are small and often have a cupule, and it produces them in the autumn. The Gueranger oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in parks and gardens."
