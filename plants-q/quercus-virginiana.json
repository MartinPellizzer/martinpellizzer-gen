    "intro": "Quercus virginiana, commonly known as the southern live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, making it highly adaptable to harsh environments. The southern live oak is also notable for its longevity and ability to grow into massive, sprawling forms."
