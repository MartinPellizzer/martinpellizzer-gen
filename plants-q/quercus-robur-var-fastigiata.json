    "intro": "Quercus robur var. fastigiata, commonly known as the columnar oak, is a cultivar of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit, making it suitable for small spaces or as a specimen tree. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This variety is often used in urban landscaping due to its compact form and adaptability to various soil conditions."
