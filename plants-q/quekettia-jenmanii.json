    "intro": "Quekettia jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a single, slender stem and a single, pale green or white flower that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"ghost\" or \"ghost-like\" flower, which is a modified leaf that resembles a flower. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on tree bases. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Quekettia jenmanii is considered a critically endangered species."
