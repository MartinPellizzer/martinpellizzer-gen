    "intro": "Quercus semecarpifolia var. longispica, commonly known as the longspike sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak. It is native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant is characterized by its elongated, slender acorns and small, leathery leaves with a smooth upper surface. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a moderate height, with a broad, spreading crown. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
