    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 jackiana, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus variabilis and Quercus serrata. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern China, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, pale acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The bark is typically smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture as the tree matures."
