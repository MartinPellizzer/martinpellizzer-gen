It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought."
