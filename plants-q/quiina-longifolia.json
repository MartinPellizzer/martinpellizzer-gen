    "intro": "Quiina longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf quiina, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its roots are deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
