    "intro": "Quercus pilosa, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to fire and pests. Quercus pilosa is often found in open forests and woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils."
