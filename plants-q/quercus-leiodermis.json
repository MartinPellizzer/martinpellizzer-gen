    "intro": "Quercus leiodermis, commonly known as the smoothleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves that are usually hairless on both sides. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The smoothleaf oak plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
