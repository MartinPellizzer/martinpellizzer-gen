    "intro": "Quercus crispifolia, commonly known as the southern live oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall before shedding. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and insect damage. Quercus crispifolia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 50 feet."
