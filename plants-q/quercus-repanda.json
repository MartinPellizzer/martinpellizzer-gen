    "intro": "Quercus repanda, commonly known as the broad-leafed oak, is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often lobed and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy cap. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus repanda is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting various wildlife species."
