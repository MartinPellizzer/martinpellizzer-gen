It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are typically glossy and have a distinct, slightly serrated edge. Quercus candicans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks."
