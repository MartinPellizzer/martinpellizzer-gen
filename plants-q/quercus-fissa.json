    "intro": "Quercus fissa, commonly known as the split-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves that often split into three or more segments, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus fissa typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its rugged, often twisted trunk and slow growth rate make it a long-lived, hardy species."
