    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora f. palmata, commonly known as the palmate sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak characterized by its distinctive palmate leaf shape. This plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia and Florida. Its leaves are typically broad, lobed, and have a waxy upper surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests and open woodlands."
