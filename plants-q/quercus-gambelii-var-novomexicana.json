    "intro": "Quercus gambelii var. novomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico Gambel oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, inedible acorns. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in its native range. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in landscape design."
