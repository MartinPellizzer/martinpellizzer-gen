    "intro": "Quercus nieuwenhuisii, commonly known as the Nieuwenhuis oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves and acorns, which are typically covered in a dense, woolly cap. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. Quercus nieuwenhuisii typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with distinct wet and dry seasons. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
