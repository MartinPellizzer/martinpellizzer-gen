    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 harbisonii, commonly known as the Harbison oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rubra (red oak) and Quercus falcata (pawnberry oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves with coarsely serrated margins. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule with bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in the southeastern United States. The Harbison oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
