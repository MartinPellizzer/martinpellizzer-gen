    "intro": "Quararibea inaequalis, commonly known as the red cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, orange-colored fruits. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
