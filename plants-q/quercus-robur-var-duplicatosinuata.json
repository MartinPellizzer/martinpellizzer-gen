    "intro": "Quercus robur var. duplicatosinuata, commonly known as the double-sinuous oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring deeply lobed leaves with a double-sinuous margin that gives it an intricate, almost lace-like appearance. This variation is primarily found in specific microclimates where genetic diversity and environmental factors contribute to its development. The plant exhibits typical oak growth habits, with a robust trunk and spreading canopy, though its ornamental leaves make it stand out in botanical gardens. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and studied for its genetic uniqueness."
