    "intro": "Quercus arnasensis, commonly known as the Arnas oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in rocky and forested areas at high elevations. The plant has distinctive leaves that are elliptical in shape with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. Its acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule, which is characteristic of the Fagaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus arnasensis is considered a vulnerable species."
