It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The tree typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has a moderate growth rate, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. The plant plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and biodiversity."
