    "intro": "Quercus seleri, commonly known as the Seler's oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, mountainous regions and has dark green, leathery leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow to orange flowers in the spring, followed by acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its dense foliage and compact form make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates. The species is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
