    "intro": "Quercus rhodophlebia f. applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf red oak, is a rare variant of the red oak species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its flattened, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical form. The plant exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its foliage in the autumn season. Its acorns are small and often have a short stalk, and they are encased in a cupule that is partially covered by the maternal tissue. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
