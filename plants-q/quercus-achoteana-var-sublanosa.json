    "intro": "Quercus achoteana var. sublanosa, commonly known as the silky oak or velvet oak, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and broad, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
