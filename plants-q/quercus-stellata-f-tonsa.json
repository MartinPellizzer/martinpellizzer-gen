    "intro": "Quercus stellata f. tonsa, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a variant of the post oak native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often lighter in color compared to the typical post oak. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and genetic variation from the main species."
