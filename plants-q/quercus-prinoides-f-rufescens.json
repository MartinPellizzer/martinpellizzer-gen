    "intro": "Quercus prinoides f. rufescens, commonly known as the red-barked oak, is a distinctive variant of the prinoides oak. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, giving it a unique appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical with a pointed tip and a smooth margin, turning reddish in the fall. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands."
