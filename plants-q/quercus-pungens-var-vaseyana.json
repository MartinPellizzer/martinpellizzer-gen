    "intro": "Quercus pungens var. vaseyana, commonly known as the Vasey's holly oak, is a shrub-like variant of the holly oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns, which are a crucial food source for various wildlife species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded or partially sunny environments. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution within the Quercus genus."
