    "intro": "Quercus aliena var. taibaiensis, commonly known as the Taibai oak, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its broad ovate leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. It thrives in cool, moist mountainous environments, often found in the Taibai Mountains region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
