    "intro": "Quercus conobalana, commonly known as the African rock oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorn-like fruits that are important for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
