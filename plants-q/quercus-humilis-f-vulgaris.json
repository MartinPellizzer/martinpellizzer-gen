    "intro": "Quercus humilis f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common rock oak, is a shrub-like variant of the rock oak species. It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and compact growth habit, often forming low, spreading mats. The leaves are typically narrow, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a glossy surface. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
