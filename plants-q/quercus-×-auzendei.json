    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 auzendei, commonly known as the Auzende oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Turkey oak) and Quercus robur (English oak). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The Auzende oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
