    "intro": "Quoya stachyodes, commonly known as the silverleaf quoya, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
