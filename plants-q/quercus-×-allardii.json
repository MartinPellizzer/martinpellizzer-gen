    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 allardii, commonly known as the Allard oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryi and Quercus berberidifolia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California, characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The leaves are typically broad-ovate with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside, and they turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a sticky resin. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in coastal climates with well-drained soils."
