    "intro": "Quintinia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain quintinia, is a rare shrub native to the montane regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its bark is thick and corky, providing some protection against environmental stress. Quintinia oreophila is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
