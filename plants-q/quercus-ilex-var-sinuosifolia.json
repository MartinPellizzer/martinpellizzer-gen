    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. sinuosifolia, commonly known as the Sinuous-leaved Holly Oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that often exhibit a distinctive sinuous or wavy margin. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with a dense, rounded crown and leathery foliage. Its acorns are small and typically have a scaly cap, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color. This species is well adapted to rocky and arid soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
