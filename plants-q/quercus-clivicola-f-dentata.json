    "intro": "Quercus clivicola f. dentata, commonly known as the toothed rock oak, is a variant of the rock oak species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. This plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that have prominent, sharp teeth along the margins. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, providing a striking contrast. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, exposed habitats. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife."
