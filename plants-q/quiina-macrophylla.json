    "intro": "Quiina macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved quiina, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Quiina macrophylla is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
