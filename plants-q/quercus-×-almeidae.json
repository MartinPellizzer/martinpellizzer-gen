    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 almeidae, commonly known as the Almeida oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Turkey oak) and Quercus faginea (Spanish oak). It is characterized by its deciduous nature and typically grows in the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant exhibits features of both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coat. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid, showcasing the genetic diversity within the Quercus genus. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically valuable species."
