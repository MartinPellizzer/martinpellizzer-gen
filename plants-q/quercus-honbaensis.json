    "intro": "Quercus honbaensis, commonly known as the Honbaean oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating, which helps in seed dispersal. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance and contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
