    "intro": "Quercus neaei, commonly known as the Neaei oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of oak native to a limited geographic region in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is rugged and fissured, providing a distinctive texture that aids in identification. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quercus neaei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
