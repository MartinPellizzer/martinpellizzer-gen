    "intro": "Quesnelia selloana, commonly known as the Selloana bromeliad, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a terrestrial bromeliad that thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowering stems produce small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Quesnelia selloana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in cooler climates as a decorative plant."
