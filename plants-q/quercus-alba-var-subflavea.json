It is characterized by its distinctive golden-brown leaves that turn yellow in the fall, distinguishing it from typical white oaks. The plant has a broad, spreading crown and can grow to heights of 20\u201340 meters, making it a prominent tree in its native habitat. Its acorns are edible and are a food source for various wildlife species. The bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged appearance that contributes to its ecological and aesthetic value."
