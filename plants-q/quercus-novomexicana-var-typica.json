    "intro": "Quercus novomexicana var. typica, commonly known as the New Mexico white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and canyons. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a key species in local ecosystems and its adaptation to arid environments."
