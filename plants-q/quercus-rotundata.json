    "intro": "Quercus rotundata, commonly known as the rounded oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, rounded canopy and lobed leaves that turn red in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for various insects and lichens. Quercus rotundata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
