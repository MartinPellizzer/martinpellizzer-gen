    "intro": "Quercus acuta var. acutiformis, commonly known as the sharpleaf oak, is a variant of the acacia oak native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its acute, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among members of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its native environment, including drought resistance and efficient nutrient uptake."
