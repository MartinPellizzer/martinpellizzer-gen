    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. subglobosa, commonly known as the globular chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, dense foliage and small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. The leaves are usually lobed and have a leathery texture, while the bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and drought. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem, supporting a variety of wildlife species."
