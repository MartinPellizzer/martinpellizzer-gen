    "intro": "Quercus cerris subf. sublobata, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a subspecies of the common oak characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically broader and more lobed compared to those of the typical subspecies, with a serrated margin that contributes to its ornamental appeal. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woody cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions of southeastern Europe and western Asia. The subspecies is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in local ecosystems."
