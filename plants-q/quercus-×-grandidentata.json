    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 grandidentata, commonly known as the chestnut oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white oak (Quercus alba) and the scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed forests. The tree has broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow to brown in autumn, and it produces small, edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Botanically, it exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a combination of white oak's acorn structure and scarlet oak's leaf morphology."
