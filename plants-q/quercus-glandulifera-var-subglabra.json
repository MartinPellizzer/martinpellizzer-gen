    "intro": "Quercus glandulifera var. subglabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that lack the hairy texture found in the typical variety. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Its leaves are oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. This variant is often found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
