    "intro": "Quercus suber f. brevicupulata, commonly known as the cork oak dwarf cupula form, is a unique variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its reduced, short cupules that encase the acorns, distinguishing it from the typical form of Quercus suber. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, and it produces small, edible acorns. This form is of particular interest in botany due to its distinct morphological features and ecological adaptations."
