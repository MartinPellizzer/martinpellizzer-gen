    "intro": "Quercus hypargyrea, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The silverleaf oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
