    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa subsp. eulanuginosa, commonly known as the silky oak or eulanuginosa oak, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, leathery leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, woody acorns that mature over several months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
