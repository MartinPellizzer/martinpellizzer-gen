    "intro": "Quadriala, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a rare variant of the Oxalis genus. It is characterized by its four leaflets, which are considered a symbol of good luck in many cultures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its small white flowers bloom in the spring. Botanically, Quadriala is closely related to other clover species and is often found in temperate regions."
