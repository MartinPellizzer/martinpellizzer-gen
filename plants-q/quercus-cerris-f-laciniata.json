    "intro": "Quercus cerris f. laciniata, commonly known as the Turkish oak or the serrated oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves. The leaves are typically longer and more sharply toothed compared to the standard Quercus cerris, giving the plant a unique appearance. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates, often found in regions of southern Europe and parts of Turkey. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture, while the acorns are small and typically have a cap that is less pronounced than in other oak species. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
