    "intro": "Quercus simillima, commonly known as the similar oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus simillima thrives in well-drained soils and prefers mild, humid climates. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use in suitable environments."
