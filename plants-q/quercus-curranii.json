    "intro": "Quercus curranii, commonly known as the canyon live oak, is a deciduous evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter, sometimes whitish, underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in canyon bottoms and chaparral habitats. The canyon live oak is known for its longevity and ability to withstand drought conditions."
