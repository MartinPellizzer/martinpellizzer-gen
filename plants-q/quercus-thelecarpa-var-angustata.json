    "intro": "Quercus thelecarpa var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant produces small, chestnut-like fruits called drupes, which are encased in a spiny husk. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged texture. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodlands."
