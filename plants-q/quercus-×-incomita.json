    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 incomita, commonly known as the live oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus virginiana (Spanish oak) and Quercus fusiformis (evergreen oak). It is a large evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The plant exhibits a broad, spreading canopy and can grow to heights of 20 to 30 meters, with a trunk that often develops a gnarled, twisted appearance. Its acorns are small, typically 1 to 1.5 centimeters long, and are enclosed in a cupule that is hairy and woody. The live oak is well adapted to coastal and urban environments, making it a common choice for landscaping in warm climates."
