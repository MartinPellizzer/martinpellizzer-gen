The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a sweet, honey-like scent that attracts pollinators. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
