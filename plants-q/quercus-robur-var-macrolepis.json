It is native to western Europe, particularly Ireland, where it thrives in temperate climates. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard Quercus robur, with a coarsely toothed margin. This variety is known for its robust growth and ability to form dense canopies, making it a valuable species in forest ecosystems. Its acorns are also an important food source for various wildlife species."
