    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica f. coccobalanus, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak variety coccobalanus, is a rare subspecies of the Dalmatian oak. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown bark and acorns that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer. This subspecies is native to the Adriatic region, particularly in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The leaves are typically shorter and more rounded compared to the typical Dalmatian oak. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in forested areas with moist, well-drained soils."
