    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. oosperma, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and leathery, oval-shaped leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This evergreen oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
