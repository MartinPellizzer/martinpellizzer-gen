    "intro": "Quercus iberica var. kozlowskyi, commonly known as the Kozlowsky's rock oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and dense, spreading crown. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. Its acorns are small and typically dispersed by animals, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat fragmentation and human activity, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
