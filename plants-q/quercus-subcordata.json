It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant has glossy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside.

This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact size and seasonal color changes."
