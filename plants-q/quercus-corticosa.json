    "intro": "Quercus corticosa, commonly known as the thin-barked oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin flakes. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a rough, sandpapery texture on both sides. It produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
