It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a unique appearance compared to other oak varieties. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its overall texture. This plant is native to specific regions in southern Italy, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
