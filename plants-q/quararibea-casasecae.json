    "intro": "Quararibea casasecae, commonly known as the Guianese mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species."
