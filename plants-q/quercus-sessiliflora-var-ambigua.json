    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous sessile oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and elliptical, dark green leaves that are often hairy underneath. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
