    "intro": "Quercus tauza, commonly known as the tauza oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The botanical features of Quercus tauza make it an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
