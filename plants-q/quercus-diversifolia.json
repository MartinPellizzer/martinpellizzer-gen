    "intro": "Quercus diversifolia, commonly known as the Chinese rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive silvery underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
