    "intro": "Quercus peduncularis, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible, spiny fruits called nuts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible yield, it is cultivated in various regions for both ecological and agricultural purposes."
