    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. subtubulosa, commonly known as the small-shelled oak, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Fagaceae family. It is characterized by its small, sessile acorns and elliptical to ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in temperate forests, often in shaded environments. It has a slow growth rate and is known for its hard, durable wood. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
