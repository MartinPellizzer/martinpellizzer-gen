    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fulhamensis, commonly known as the Fulham oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) and Quercus sessilifolia (chestnut oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in parks and gardens due to its ornamental value. The bark is smooth when young and becomes fissured with age, adding to its visual interest."
