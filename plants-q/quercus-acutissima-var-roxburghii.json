    "intro": "Quercus acutissima var. roxburghii, commonly known as the Roxburgh's sharpleaf oak, is a variant of the Chinese oak native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, acuminate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with moderate to high humidity. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
