    "intro": "Quiina silvatica, commonly known as the silverwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
