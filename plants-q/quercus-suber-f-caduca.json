    "intro": "Quercus suber f. caduca, commonly known as the cork oak variant with shedding bark, is a botanical variant of the Mediterranean cork oak. It is characterized by its unique feature of shedding its outer bark in patches, unlike the typical smooth bark of the standard cork oak. This shedding is a natural process that reveals the lighter, younger layers beneath. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in warm, dry climates with well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat, supporting diverse flora and fauna."
