    "intro": "Quercus aegilops var. taygetea, commonly known as the Taygetean oak, is a rare and ancient variant of the oak genus native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, this species faces significant threats to its survival."
