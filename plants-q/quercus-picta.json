    "intro": "Quercus picta, commonly known as the painted oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in Guatemala and Mexico. The tree is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and sometimes red or yellow hues. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and has a broad, spreading canopy. The bark is thick and fissured, often appearing reddish-brown, and the tree produces small, red acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife."
