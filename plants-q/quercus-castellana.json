    "intro": "Quercus castellana, commonly known as the Castellana oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with a rounded crown and dark green, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
