    "intro": "Queenslandiella hyalina, commonly known as the glassy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy thallus that gives it a glass-like appearance. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It typically grows on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is often found in moist, undisturbed habitats."
