    "intro": "Quercus robur var. puberula, commonly known as the downy oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive pubescent (hairy) foliage. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are elliptical with a rounded base and a serrated margin, often appearing with a soft downy texture on both sides. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions."
