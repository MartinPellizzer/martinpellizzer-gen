    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupine oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Quercus polymorpha and Quercus brandegeeii, with dense, leathery foliage and a rounded, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically reddish-brown in color and are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in landscapes with suitable conditions."
