    "intro": "Quercus pinfaensis, commonly known as the Pinfaensian oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and are often consumed by wildlife, contributing to its ecological role. Quercus pinfaensis is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental qualities."
