    "intro": "Quercus aguana, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and often have a scaly cap, and they are an important food source for wildlife. Quercus aguana typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests."
