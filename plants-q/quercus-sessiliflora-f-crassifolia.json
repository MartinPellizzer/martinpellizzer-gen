    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora f. crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak characterized by its broader, more leathery leaves. This form is typically found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth margin. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat in woodland ecosystems."
