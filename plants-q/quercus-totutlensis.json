    "intro": "Quercus totutlensis, commonly known as the Totutla oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the following months. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
