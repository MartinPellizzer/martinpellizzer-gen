    "intro": "Quercus chrysolepis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf canyon live oak, is a compact variant of the canyon live oak. It is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. The plant features broad, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and more rounded than those of the standard species. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability."
