    "intro": "Quercus lucorum, commonly known as the sweet chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red-brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, which provides protection for the developing seed. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Quercus lucorum is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, contributing to biodiversity in its native habitats."
