    "intro": "Quercus ewyckii, commonly known as the Ewyck oak, is a rare species of evergreen oak native to the mountains of southern Spain. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus ewyckii is considered a vulnerable species."
