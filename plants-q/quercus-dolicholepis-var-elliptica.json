    "intro": "Quercus dolicholepis var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical chinquapin, is a rare and relict species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by spiny, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
