    "intro": "Quercus calliprinos var. recurvans, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and elongated, alternate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in the chaparral and woodland ecosystems."
