It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia and Florida. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaf venation patterns, which vary across different populations. Its acorns are typically small and have a scaly cap, typical of many oak species. The tree prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
