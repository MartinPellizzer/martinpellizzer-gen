It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in drooping clusters, followed by edible, sweet, chestnut-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine. The subspecies sublanosa is distinguished by its fine, velvety pubescence on the underside of its leaves."
