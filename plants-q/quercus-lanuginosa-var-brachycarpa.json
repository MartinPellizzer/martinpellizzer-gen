    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-brown bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a two-year cycle, a feature common in many oak species. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories."
