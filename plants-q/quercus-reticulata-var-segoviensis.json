    "intro": "Quercus reticulata var. segoviensis, commonly known as the Segovia oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, reticulate leaf venation. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a serrated margin. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature typical of the Fagaceae family. This species is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions of Spain."
