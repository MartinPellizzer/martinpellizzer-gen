    "intro": "Quercus lanata subsp. lanata, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and large, lobed leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by acorn-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
