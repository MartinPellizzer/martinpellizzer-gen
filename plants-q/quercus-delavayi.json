    "intro": "Quercus delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, bristly cap. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
