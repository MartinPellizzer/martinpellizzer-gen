    "intro": "Quercus xalapensis var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf oak, is a variant of the Mexican oak native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous regions with a preference for well-drained soils. The leaves are elongated and have a pointed tip, distinguishing it from other varieties of Quercus xalapensis. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. This species is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional construction and crafts."
