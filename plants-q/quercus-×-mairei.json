    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 mairei, commonly known as the Maire oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus suber (the cork oak) and Quercus robur (the English oak). It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
