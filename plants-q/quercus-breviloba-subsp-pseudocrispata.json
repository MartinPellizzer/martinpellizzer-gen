    "intro": "Quercus breviloba subsp. pseudocrispata, commonly known as the narrowleaf white oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The leaves turn yellow or reddish in the fall before dropping, contributing to its seasonal appearance. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
