    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of xerophytic vegetation."
