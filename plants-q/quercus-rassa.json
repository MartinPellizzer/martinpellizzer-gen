    "intro": "Quercus rassa, commonly known as the dwarf oak, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 5 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage with leathery leaves. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Quercus rassa is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
