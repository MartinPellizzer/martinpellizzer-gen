    "intro": "Quercus mirbeckii f. tlemcenensis, commonly known as the Tlemcen oak, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Maghreb region of North Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
