The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to the cool, arid conditions of its native habitat. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings. Quinchamalium procumbens is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
