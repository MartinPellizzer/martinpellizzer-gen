    "intro": "Quercus torulosa var. granulata, commonly known as the granulate chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive member of the Fagaceae family. It is characterized by its small, rounded acorns enclosed in a thick, scaly cupule. The leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant often grows in dry, rocky soils. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia and South Carolina. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
