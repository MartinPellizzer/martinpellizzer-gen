    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf evergreen oak, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in spring, followed by red, ball-shaped fruits called acorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
