    "intro": "Quercus aliena, commonly known as the alien oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of oak native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its acorns are typically smaller than those of other oak species. The plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often found in mountainous forest ecosystems. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic makeup and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus aliena is considered a species of conservation concern."
