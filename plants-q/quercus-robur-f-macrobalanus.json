    "intro": "Quercus robur f. macrobalanus, commonly known as the giant English oak, is a distinctive variant of the common oak characterized by its exceptionally large leaves. This form exhibits a unique morphology, with leaves that are broader and more elongated compared to the typical Quercus robur. The plant is native to parts of Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its robust growth and striking foliage make it a notable specimen in botanical gardens and historical landscapes. Due to its rarity and size, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
