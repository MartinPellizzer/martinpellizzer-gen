    "intro": "Quercus lanata var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the silky oak or eriocarpous oak, is a variant of the silky oak species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule with dense, woolly bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and forested areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
