    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. lanceolata, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This evergreen shrub or small tree is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
