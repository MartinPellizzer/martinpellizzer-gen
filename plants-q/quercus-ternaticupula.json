    "intro": "Quercus ternaticupula, commonly known as the narrow-cupped oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule with narrow, overlapping scales. The leaves are generally elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory in mixed hardwood forests."
