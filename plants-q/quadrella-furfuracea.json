    "intro": "Quadrella furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, crust-like appearance with a dense covering of fine, hair-like structures. It typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner, which provides structural support. Its unique texture and coloration make it easily identifiable in ecological surveys. The plant plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a bioindicator of environmental conditions."
