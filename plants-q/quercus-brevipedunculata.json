    "intro": "Quercus brevipedunculata, commonly known as the sand live oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, dark blue to black berries. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
