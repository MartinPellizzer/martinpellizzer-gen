    "intro": "Quercus gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically lobed and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Quercus gussonei is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
