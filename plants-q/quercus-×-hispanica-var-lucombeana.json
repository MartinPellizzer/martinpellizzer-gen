    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hispanica var. lucombeana, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut oak, is a hybrid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a season, often taking two years to fully develop. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic bridge between several oak species in the region."
