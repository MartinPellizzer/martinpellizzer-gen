It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface and a pale, sometimes hairy underside. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
