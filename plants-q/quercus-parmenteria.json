    "intro": "Quercus parmenteria, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and lobed, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and canyons. Quercus parmenteria is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a significant role in local ecosystems."
