    "intro": "Quercus litorea, commonly known as the coastal dune oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is well adapted to sandy, saline soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are usually covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Its acorns are small and are often enclosed in a cupule, providing food for wildlife. Quercus litorea plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the coastline."
