    "intro": "Quintinia serrata var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved quintinia, is a shrub native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It features narrow, elliptical leaves that are often serrated along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
