    "intro": "Quercus calophylla f. flavida, commonly known as the goldenleaf oak, is a rare variant of the coastal live oak. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical green of its parent species. This form is native to specific regions of southern California, where it thrives in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. The leaves are typically smaller and more densely packed than those of the standard species. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
