It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the daisy family. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall."
