    "intro": "Quintinia nutantiflora, commonly known as the hanging-flowered quintinia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. Quintinia nutantiflora is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
