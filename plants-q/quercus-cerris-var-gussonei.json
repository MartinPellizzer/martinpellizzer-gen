    "intro": "Quercus cerris var. gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's Turkey Oak, is a rare variant of the Turkey Oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated acorns and deeply lobed leaves with a silvery underside. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the warm, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
