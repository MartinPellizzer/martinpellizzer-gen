    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata f. extensa, commonly known as the broad-leafed Chinese chestnut, is a variant of the Chinese chestnut tree characterized by its broader leaves and more open growth habit. It is native to China and is often found in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. The plant exhibits a deciduous nature, shedding its leaves seasonally, and has a long, slender acorn that is typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects. The tree is also notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial to full sunlight."
