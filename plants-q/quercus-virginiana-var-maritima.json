    "intro": "Quercus virginiana var. maritima, commonly known as the maritime live oak, is a variety of the live oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by small, dark brown acorns that are encased in a cupule. It has a deep root system that helps it withstand salt spray and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. This evergreen tree can grow quite large, often reaching heights of 30 to 50 feet, and is known for its longevity and resilience."
