    "intro": "Quercus endresii, commonly known as Endres' oak, is a rare and critically endangered species native to a small region in southern Mexico. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
