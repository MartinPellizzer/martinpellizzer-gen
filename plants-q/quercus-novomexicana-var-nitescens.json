    "intro": "Quercus novomexicana var. nitescens, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip and a smooth or slightly toothed margin. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and chaparral habitats. Its acorns are small and usually have a short stalk, contributing to its ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
