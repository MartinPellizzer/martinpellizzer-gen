    "intro": "Quercus lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly cap. Its bark is gray to reddish-brown and develops deep fissures with age. Quercus lancifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
