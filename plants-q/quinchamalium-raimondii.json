    "intro": "Quinchamalium raimondii, commonly known as the Raimondi's quinchamalium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, woolly leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool, humid climates. Its botanical features include a caudex-like stem and clusters of small, hairy leaves that help it conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
