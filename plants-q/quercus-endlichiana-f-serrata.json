    "intro": "Quercus endlichiana f. serrata, commonly known as the serrated chinquapin oak, is a rare and relict species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and distinctive serrated leaf margins. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its foliage consists of alternate, simple, and often deeply lobed leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species with restricted conservation status."
