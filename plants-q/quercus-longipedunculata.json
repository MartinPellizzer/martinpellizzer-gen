    "intro": "Quercus longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its elongated peduncles that bear clusters of acorns. The leaves are typically lobed, with a serrated margin, and the bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age. It produces acorns that are edible for wildlife and historically used by Indigenous peoples. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
