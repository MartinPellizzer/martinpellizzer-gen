    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. laciniata, commonly known as the serrated sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak characterized by its finely serrated leaf margins. It is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Alps and Carpathians. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, spiky acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic foliage and structural form."
