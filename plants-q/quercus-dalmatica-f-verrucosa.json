    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica f. verrucosa, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak variegated form, is a unique variation of the Dalmatian oak. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. This feature gives the plant a striking, almost fuzzy appearance, especially noticeable when viewed up close. The plant is native to the Adriatic region and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
