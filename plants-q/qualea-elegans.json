It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in flooded forests. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, adapted for buoyancy in water. Qualea elegans plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
