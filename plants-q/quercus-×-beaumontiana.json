    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 beaumontiana, commonly known as the Beaumont oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryana and Quercus rugosa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats. The Beaumont oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
