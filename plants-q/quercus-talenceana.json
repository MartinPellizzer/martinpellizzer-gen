    "intro": "Quercus talenceana, commonly known as the Talence oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with a rounded crown and dark green, leathery leaves. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
