    "intro": "Quercus fructiseptata, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, seven-lobed acorns, which give it its scientific name. The tree has a broad, open crown with elongated, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by the acorns that mature over the summer. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its hard, durable wood."
