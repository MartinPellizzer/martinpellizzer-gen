    "intro": "Quercus robusta, commonly known as the Chinese oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its robust, often twisted trunk and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus robusta thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
