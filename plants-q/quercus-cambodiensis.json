It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its lobed leaves and produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical moist lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and faces threats from deforestation and land conversion."
