    "intro": "Quercus menesiensis, commonly known as the Men\u00e9ndez oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
