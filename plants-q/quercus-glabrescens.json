    "intro": "Quercus glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive among oak species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Quercus glabrescens plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
