    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. subinclusa, commonly known as the Iberian oak, is a rare subspecies native to southwestern Europe, particularly Portugal and Spain. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
