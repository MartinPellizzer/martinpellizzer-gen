    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. ovifolia, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its leathery, ovate leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This evergreen oak is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and reforestation projects."
