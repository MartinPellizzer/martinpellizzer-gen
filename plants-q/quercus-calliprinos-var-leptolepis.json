It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long and have a distinctive lobed shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and stabilizing coastal dunes."
