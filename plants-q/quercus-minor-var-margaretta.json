    "intro": "Quercus minor var. margaretta, commonly known as Margaretta oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the southern red oak. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to other oak species. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in the southeastern United States. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
