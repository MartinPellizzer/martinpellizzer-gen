    "intro": "Quercus granitica, commonly known as the granite oak, is a hardy deciduous tree native to the rocky mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark that provides resistance to fire and insect damage. Its leaves are typically lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and they turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in areas with high elevation and cool, moist climates."
