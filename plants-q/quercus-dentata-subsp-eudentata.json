    "intro": "Quercus dentata subsp. eudentata, commonly known as the Japanese pagoda tree, is a deciduous species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping branches that resemble a pagoda, giving it its common name. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with doubly serrated margins, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks."
