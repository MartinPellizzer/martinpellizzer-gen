    "intro": "Quinchamalium parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered quinchamalium, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its compact stature and delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
