    "intro": "Quercus rubramenta, commonly known as the red-tinged oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the temperate regions of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The tree is characterized by its lobed leaves, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, and its production of acorns that serve as a food source for various wildlife. Quercus rubramenta typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against pests and environmental stress."
