    "intro": "Quercus alba var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf white oak, is a smaller variant of the white oak, characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 meters, making it suitable for smaller landscapes or urban settings. The leaves are lobed and have a distinctive appearance, similar to those of the larger white oak, but are often smaller and more rounded. It produces small, edible acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
