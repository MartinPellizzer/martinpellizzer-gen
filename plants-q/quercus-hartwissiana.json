    "intro": "Quercus hartwissiana, commonly known as the Hartwissiana oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or oblong in shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant plant."
