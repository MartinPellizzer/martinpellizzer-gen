    "intro": "Quercus leiophylla f. subintegra, commonly known as the smoothleaf white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature of the oak genus. Its bark is generally smooth and grayish in color, becoming more fissured with age. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives best in well-drained, acidic conditions."
