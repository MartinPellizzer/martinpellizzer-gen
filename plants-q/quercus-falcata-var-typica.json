    "intro": "Quercus falcata var. typica, commonly known as the sourwood or sweet gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often described as sickle-shaped. The tree produces small, pale green flowers in the spring, which are followed by spherical, spiky fruits called capsules. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. The leaves turn a striking yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value in landscaping."
