    "intro": "Quechua glabrescens, commonly known as the Andean mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in high-altitude gardens."
