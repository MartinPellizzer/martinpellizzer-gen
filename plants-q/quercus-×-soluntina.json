    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 soluntina, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the common oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to its parent species. The tree produces small, pale acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas across Central and Eastern Europe. This hybrid is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
