    "intro": "Quercus macrocarpa var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a variant of the bur oak characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit. It is native to the central and eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. The leaves are usually shorter and broader than those of the typical bur oak, with a rounded or slightly notched shape. It produces small, edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions."
