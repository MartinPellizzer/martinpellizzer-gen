    "intro": "Quercus microphylla var. uhdeana, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to central Mexico. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dense, evergreen foliage."
