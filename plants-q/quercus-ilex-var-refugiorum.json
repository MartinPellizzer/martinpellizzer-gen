    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. refugiorum, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a subspecies of the holm oak native to southern Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to drought and its historical role as a refuge for plant species during the last Ice Age."
