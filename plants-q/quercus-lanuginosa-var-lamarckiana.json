It is characterized by its grayish-brown, fissured bark and small, acorn-like fruits that are typically borne in clusters. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy underside and a pointed tip, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and ecological benefits."
