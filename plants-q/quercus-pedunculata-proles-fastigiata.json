    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata proles fastigiata, commonly known as the fastigiate chestnut oak, is a species of oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit, which gives it a columnar shape. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. Its acorns are small, with a scaly cap, and are an important food source for wildlife. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in urban landscaping due to its compact form and ornamental value."
