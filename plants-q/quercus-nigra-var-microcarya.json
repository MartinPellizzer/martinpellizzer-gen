    "intro": "Quercus nigra var. microcarya, commonly known as the dwarf black oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, featuring a dense, rounded canopy and thick, dark green foliage. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a distinctive doubly serrated margin. Its acorns are small, with a scaly cap and are an important food source for wildlife. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and upland forests."
