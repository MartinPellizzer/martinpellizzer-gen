    "intro": "Quercus uvariifolia, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Vietnam. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are often lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
