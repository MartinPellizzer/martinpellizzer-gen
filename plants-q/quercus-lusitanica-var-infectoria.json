    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. infectoria, commonly known as the Iberian oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant features. It plays a vital role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
