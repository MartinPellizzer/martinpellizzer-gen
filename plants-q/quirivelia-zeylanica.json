    "intro": "Quirivelia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon quillwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the Characeae family. It is characterized by its branched, ribbon-like stems and small, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces tiny, single-celled spores that are released into the water for reproduction. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Quirivelia zeylanica plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for microorganisms."
