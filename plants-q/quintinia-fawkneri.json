    "intro": "Quintinia fawkneri, commonly known as the Fawkner's quintinia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the southeastern region of Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually white or pale pink, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quintinia fawkneri is considered a species of conservation concern."
