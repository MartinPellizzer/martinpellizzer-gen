It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its roots are adapted to absorb water and nutrients efficiently from the saturated ground. Quinchamalium pratense plays an important ecological role in its habitat by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
