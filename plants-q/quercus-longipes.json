    "intro": "Quercus longipes, commonly known as the longleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in pine woodlands. The longleaf oak is also valued for its hard, durable wood and historical significance in the region's ecology."
