    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica f. insulae-manastir, commonly known as the Manastir Island oak, is a rare botanical variant native to the Dalmatian region of Croatia. This form of the common oak exhibits distinct morphological characteristics, including smaller leaves and a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Quercus dalmatica. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often found on rocky soils and coastal areas, which contribute to its limited distribution. The plant's unique features make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. Its genetic distinctiveness highlights the importance of preserving such rare plant forms in their natural habitats."
