    "intro": "Quercus eichleri, commonly known as the Eichleri oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woody cupule. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Quercus eichleri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
