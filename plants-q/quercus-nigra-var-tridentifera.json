    "intro": "Quercus nigra var. tridentifera, commonly known as the three-toothed water oak, is a variant of the water oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive three-toothed lobes on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are dark green and turn reddish-brown in the fall, adding seasonal interest. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife."
