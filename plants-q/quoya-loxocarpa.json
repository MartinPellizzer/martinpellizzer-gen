It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red or pink flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Quoya loxocarpa is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used for carving and construction."
