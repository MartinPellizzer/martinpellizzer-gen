    "intro": "Quercus utahensis var. mollis, commonly known as the smooth Utah oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are enclosed in cupules, a feature typical of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
