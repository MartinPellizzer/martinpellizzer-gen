    "intro": "Quercus bicolor var. michauxii, commonly known as the white oak mapleleaf, is a variant of the white oak native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, with a distinctive lobed shape and a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and conservation efforts."
