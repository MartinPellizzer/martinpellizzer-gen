    "intro": "Quercus nigra var. megacarpa, commonly known as the big-cupped water oak, is a variant of the water oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, broad acorns and distinctive, often pendulous, acorn cups that enclose most of the nut. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplain forests. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
