It is native to the mountainous regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. This evergreen tree can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring broad, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy cap. Quercus jenkinsiana is valued for its ecological importance and is often found in cloud forests where it contributes to biodiversity."
