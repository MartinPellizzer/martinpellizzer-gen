    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved scrub oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are broader than those of the typical Q. lanuginosa, with a silvery underside due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its dense growth habit makes it valuable for erosion control and as a habitat for wildlife."
