    "intro": "Quercus calliprinos, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is distinctive in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
