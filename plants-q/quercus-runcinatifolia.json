    "intro": "Quercus runcinatifolia, commonly known as the serratedleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that have finely serrated margins, which give it its common name. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a hairy cupule. Its foliage is often a deep green in summer and turns yellow or reddish in autumn. Quercus runcinatifolia is valued for its ecological role and ornamental qualities in horticulture."
