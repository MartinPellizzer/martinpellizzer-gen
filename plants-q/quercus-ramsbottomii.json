    "intro": "Quercus ramsbottomii, commonly known as the Ramsbottom oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
