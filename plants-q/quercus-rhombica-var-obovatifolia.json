    "intro": "Quercus rhombica var. obovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical to obovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically 1\u20132 cm in length and are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The leaves turn a vibrant yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value."
