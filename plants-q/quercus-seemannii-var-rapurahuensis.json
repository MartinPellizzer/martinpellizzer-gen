    "intro": "Quercus seemannii var. rapurahuensis, commonly known as the Rapurahuensis oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand's South Island. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The tree typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the harsh alpine climate and its role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
