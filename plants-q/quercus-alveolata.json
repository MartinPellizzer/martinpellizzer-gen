    "intro": "Quercus alveolata, commonly known as the alveolate oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which have a shallow, cup-like depression at the base, giving it its scientific name. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically found in clusters. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus alveolata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
