    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. subpinnatifida, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western and central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive subpinnatifid margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by hard, chestnut-like fruits that contain one or two seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful for construction and furniture-making."
