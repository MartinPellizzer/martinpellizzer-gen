    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 willdenowiana, commonly known as the willdenow's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas across Europe. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
