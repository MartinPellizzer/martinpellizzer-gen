    "intro": "Quercus chimaltenangana, commonly known as the Chimaltenango oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to highland regions of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
