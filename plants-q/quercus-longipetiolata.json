    "intro": "Quercus longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaf petioles, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. This species produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
