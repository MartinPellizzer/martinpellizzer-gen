    "intro": "Quercus dumosa subsp. turbinella, commonly known as the desert live oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically encased in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry regions."
