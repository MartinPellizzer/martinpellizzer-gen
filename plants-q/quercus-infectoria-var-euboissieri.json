    "intro": "Quercus infectoria var. euboissieri, commonly known as the Euboian gall oak, is a rare variant of the gall oak species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like structures called galls, which are formed in response to insect infestations, particularly by the wasp species *Urocerus quadrisetos*. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a host plant for specific insect species and its adaptation to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
