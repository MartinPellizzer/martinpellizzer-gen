    "intro": "Quercus taliensis, commonly known as the Taliensis oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, often appearing lobed or toothed. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that partially encloses the nut, and it produces them in the fall. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in mixed forests with other broadleaf species."
