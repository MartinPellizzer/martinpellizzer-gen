    "intro": "Quercus concentrica, commonly known as the concentric oak, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant in the Fagaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive concentric ring patterns on its leaves, which are formed by the overlapping of multiple layers of tissue. This plant is native to specific regions in China and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. The concentric oak has small, acorn-like fruits that are typically dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
