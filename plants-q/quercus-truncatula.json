    "intro": "Quercus truncatula, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. The bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a distinctive appearance."
