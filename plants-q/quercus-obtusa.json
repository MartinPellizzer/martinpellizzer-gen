    "intro": "Quercus obtusa, commonly known as the Japanese oak, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus obtusa is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
