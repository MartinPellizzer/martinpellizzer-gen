    "intro": "Quercus garryana subsp. breweri, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lobed, leathery leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a thick, inedible cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The subspecies breweri is distinguished by its smaller leaves and more compact growth compared to other forms of Quercus garryana."
