    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the live oak (Quercus virginiana) and the Mexican white oak (Quercus polymyrena). It is characterized by its broad, spreading canopy and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, pale green acorns that are often covered with a sticky resin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in coastal regions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
