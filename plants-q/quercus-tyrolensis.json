    "intro": "Quercus tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrol oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Alps and surrounding regions of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in mountainous areas with well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate. Quercus tyrolensis is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in reforestation efforts in its native habitats."
