    "intro": "Quercus oleoides var. typica, commonly known as the smoothleaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like acorns. Its acorns are enclosed in a cupule and are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
