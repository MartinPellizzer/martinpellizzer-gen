    "intro": "Quercus gambelii var. vreelandii, commonly known as the Vreeland gambel oak, is a variant of the Gambel oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture, while the bark is thick and fissured. This plant is adapted to rocky soils and can often be found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
