    "intro": "Quercus pichleri, commonly known as the Pichler oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with a compact, rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
