    "intro": "Quercus seibertii, commonly known as the Seibert's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Turkey. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. The tree's dense foliage and sturdy structure make it a valuable component of its native ecosystem."
