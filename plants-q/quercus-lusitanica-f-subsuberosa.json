    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. subsuberosa, commonly known as the Portuguese white oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Portuguese oak. It is characterized by its unique subsuberous structure, which refers to the presence of thick, cork-like layers beneath the bark. This feature helps it retain moisture and resist environmental stress, making it well adapted to its native habitat. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
