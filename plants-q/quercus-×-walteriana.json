    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 walteriana, commonly known as the Walter's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Turkey oak) and Quercus robur (English oak). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is native to Europe and is often found in woodland habitats. Quercus \u00d7 walteriana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
