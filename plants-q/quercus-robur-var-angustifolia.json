    "intro": "Quercus robur var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a variant of the English oak characterized by its narrower, elongated leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe, typically found in forested areas with moist, well-drained soils. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown and distinctive lobed leaves that turn golden in autumn. Its acorns are small and provide food for various wildlife, while its hard wood has been historically used for construction and furniture. This variety is valued for its ecological role and ornamental appeal in landscaping."
