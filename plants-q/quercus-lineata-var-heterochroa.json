    "intro": "Quercus lineata var. heterochroa, commonly known as the variable oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the lineated oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a combination of green and white or silver-colored veins that create a striking visual contrast. The plant is native to specific regions in Mexico, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its leaves are typically elliptical or lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a leathery texture. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
