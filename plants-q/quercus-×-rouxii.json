    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 rouxii, commonly known as the Roux's oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) and Quercus faginea (Hungarian oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The plant exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, including variations in leaf shape and acorn morphology. It is native to the Carpathian Basin and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it is relatively rare and of interest to botanists studying oak genetics and speciation."
