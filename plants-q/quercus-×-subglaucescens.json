    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 subglaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus macrocarpa (bur oak) and Quercus bicolor (swamp white oak). It is characterized by its distinctive grayish-blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. It produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in riparian ecosystems."
