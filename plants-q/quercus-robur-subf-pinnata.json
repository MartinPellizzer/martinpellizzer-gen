    "intro": "Quercus robur subf. pinnata, commonly known as the European sessile oak, is a subspecies of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically more deeply indented than those of the typical Q. robur. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic soils. This subspecies is often used in forestry and landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic value."
