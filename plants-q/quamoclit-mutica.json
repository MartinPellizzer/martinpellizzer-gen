    "intro": "Quamoclit mutica, commonly known as the sticky cactus, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. The sticky resin on its stems serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores and pests."
