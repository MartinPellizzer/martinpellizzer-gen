    "intro": "Quercus araxina, commonly known as the Araxina oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Quercus araxina thrives in coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in well-drained soils. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a notable species within the Quercus genus."
