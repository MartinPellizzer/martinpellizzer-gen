    "intro": "Quercus platanoides, commonly known as the Turkey oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and dark green, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing structural support and protection against pests. Quercus platanoides is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland and open areas."
