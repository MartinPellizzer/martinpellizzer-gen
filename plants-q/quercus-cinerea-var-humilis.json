    "intro": "Quercus cinerea var. humilis, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and thick, leathery leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cap. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and unique appearance."
