    "intro": "Quercus cerridolepis, commonly known as the African rock oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers in the spring, followed by acorn-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in local ecosystems."
