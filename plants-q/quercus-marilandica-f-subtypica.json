    "intro": "Quercus marilandica f. subtypica, commonly known as the Maryland oak, is a rare and relict form of the white oak. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, leathery leaves with a distinctive lobed shape. This subspecies is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Maryland and Virginia. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role as a living fossil, offering insights into the evolutionary history of oaks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority."
