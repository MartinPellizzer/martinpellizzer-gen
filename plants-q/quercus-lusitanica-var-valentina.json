    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. valentina, commonly known as the Valentina oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Lusitanian oak. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically found in southern Portugal and northern Spain. This deciduous tree is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and glossy, dark green leaves. The Valentina oak thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
