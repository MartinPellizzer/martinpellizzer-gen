    "intro": "Quercus deliquescens, commonly known as the desert live oak, is a small, slow-growing evergreen tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, gnarled trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. The leaves and bark contain tannins, which have been used historically for tanning leather and in traditional medicine."
