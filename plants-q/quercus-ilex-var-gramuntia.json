    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. gramuntia, commonly known as the evergreen holm oak, is a subspecies of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery evergreen leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is highly drought-tolerant. This subspecies is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
