    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 prasina, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the common oak (Quercus robur). It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant typically grows in temperate regions of Europe and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are not as commonly consumed by wildlife as those of other oak species. The evergreen oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
