    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 knoblochii, commonly known as the Knobloch oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Turkey oak) and Quercus robur (English oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, pale acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
