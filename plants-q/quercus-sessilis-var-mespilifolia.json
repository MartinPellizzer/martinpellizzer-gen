    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. mespilifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, which is covered with dense, velvety hair. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. The leaves and acorns are used in traditional medicine and are also valuable for wildlife habitat."
