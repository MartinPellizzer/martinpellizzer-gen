    "intro": "Quercus robur var. tardissima, commonly known as the late-leafing English oak, is a rare variant of the English oak characterized by its delayed leafing and unique growth patterns. This deciduous tree is native to parts of Europe and is distinguished by its elongated acorns and slower growth rate compared to standard Quercus robur. Its foliage emerges later in the spring, often after other oak species, which makes it visually distinct in the forest canopy. The leaves are typically broader and have a more pronounced lobing, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
