    "intro": "Quercus alba var. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed white oak, is a variant of the white oak native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often wider than they are long, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that mature over two years, a trait common among oaks. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, providing a rugged texture. This variety is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
