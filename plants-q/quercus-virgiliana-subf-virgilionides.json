    "intro": "Quercus virgiliana subf. virgilionides, commonly known as the Virgilian oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for taxonomists and conservationists. Due to habitat fragmentation and climate change, this subspecies faces increasing threats to its survival."
