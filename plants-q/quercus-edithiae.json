    "intro": "Quercus edithiae, commonly known as the Edith's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that partially encloses the nut, and they are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus edithiae is considered a vulnerable species."
