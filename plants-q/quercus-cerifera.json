    "intro": "Quercus cerifera, commonly known as the waxleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red-brown acorns in the fall. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The waxleaf oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its year-round visual interest."
