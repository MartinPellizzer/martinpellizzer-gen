    "intro": "Quelchia cardonae, commonly known as the cactus lichen, is a unique symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, particularly in regions with high solar exposure. The plant forms a crust-like structure on the surface of cacti, providing protection against extreme desert conditions. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its harsh habitat. Its ability to survive with minimal water makes it an essential component of desert ecosystems."
