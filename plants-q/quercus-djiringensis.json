    "intro": "Quercus djiringensis, commonly known as the Djiringi cork oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Madagascar. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in humid, lowland forests, characterized by its thick, corky bark and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, Quercus djiringensis is classified as critically endangered."
