    "intro": "Quercus richteri, commonly known as the Richter oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are often enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. The Richter oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
