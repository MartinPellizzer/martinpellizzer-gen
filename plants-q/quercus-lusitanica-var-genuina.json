    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. genuina, commonly known as the Iberian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
