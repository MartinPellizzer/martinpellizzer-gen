    "intro": "Quercus aquatica var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated water oak, is a variant of the water oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically longer and more elongated than those of the typical water oak. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils near water bodies, making it a common sight in wetland areas. Its acorns are small and often have a distinctive cap that aids in seed dispersal. This species plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
