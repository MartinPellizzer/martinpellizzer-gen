It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This variant is notable for its ability to form dense thickets, contributing to its ecological significance in Mediterranean ecosystems."
