    "intro": "Quercus poculifer, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to central Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in dry to moist soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps it withstand environmental stress."
