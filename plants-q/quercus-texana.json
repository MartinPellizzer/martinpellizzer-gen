    "intro": "Quercus texana, commonly known as the Texas live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling canopy and thick, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The tree produces small, spiky capsules that contain one to three seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration. The Texas live oak is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
