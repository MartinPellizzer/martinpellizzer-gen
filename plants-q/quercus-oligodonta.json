    "intro": "Quercus oligodonta, commonly known as the red oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus oligodonta typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
