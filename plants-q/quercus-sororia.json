    "intro": "Quercus sororia, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in scrub habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
