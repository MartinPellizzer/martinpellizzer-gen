    "intro": "Quercus quadrans, commonly known as the Florida mapleleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a distinctive quadrilateral shape at the base. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by small, leathery acorns that mature in the fall. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, while its leaves are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. Quercus quadrans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and bottomlands."
