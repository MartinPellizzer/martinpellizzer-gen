    "intro": "Quercus robur var. brevisecta, commonly known as the dwarf English oak, is a compact variant of the common oak. It features a broad, rounded crown with short, spreading branches that give it a dense, shrub-like appearance. The leaves are typically oval with a rounded tip and a serrated edge, turning red in the autumn. It produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This variety is well-suited for small gardens due to its manageable size and ornamental value."
