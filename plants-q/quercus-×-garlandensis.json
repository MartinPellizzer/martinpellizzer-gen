    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 garlandensis, commonly known as the Garland oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is native to the British Isles and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a scaly cap, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. The Garland oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
