    "intro": "Quercus danubialis, commonly known as the Danube oak, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is grayish-brown and becomes furrowed with age, while its wood is dense and valued for its durability. Quercus danubialis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks."
