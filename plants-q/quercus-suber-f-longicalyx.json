    "intro": "Quercus suber f. longicalyx, commonly known as the long-leaved cork oak, is a variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its elongated, leathery leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical Quercus suber. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This subspecies is valued for its unique foliage and ecological role in its native habitat."
