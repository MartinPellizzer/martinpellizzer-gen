    "intro": "Quercus amissiloba, commonly known as the Amissila oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The tree typically grows in humid, montane forests where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus amissiloba is considered a vulnerable species."
