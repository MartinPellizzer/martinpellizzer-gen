    "intro": "Quercus hystrix var. mappacea, commonly known as the Mappacean holly oak, is a variant of the holly oak native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and have a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant produces small, spiky acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oak species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
