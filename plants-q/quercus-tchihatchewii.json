    "intro": "Quercus tchihatchewii, commonly known as the Tchihatchewii oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and dark green, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some resistance to drought and fire. Quercus tchihatchewii is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments."
