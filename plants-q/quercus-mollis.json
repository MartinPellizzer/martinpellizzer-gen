    "intro": "Quercus mollis, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The tree produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers in clusters, followed by acorns that are enclosed in cupules. Its leaves and acorns are important food sources for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
