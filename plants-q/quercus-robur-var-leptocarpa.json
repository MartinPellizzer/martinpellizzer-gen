    "intro": "Quercus robur var. leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender-leaved oak, is a variant of the English oak characterized by its narrower leaves and more open growth habit. It is native to Europe and is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The plant has serrated leaf margins and produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is a slow-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a long lifespan exceeding 300 years. The bark is deeply furrowed and becomes more rugged with age, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
