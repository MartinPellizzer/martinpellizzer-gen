    "intro": "Quercus conferta var. macrophyllos, commonly known as the broad-leaf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often lobed and have a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, cup-like fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its leaves turn a striking yellow or red in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. This species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streambanks."
