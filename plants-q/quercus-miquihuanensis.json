    "intro": "Quercus miquihuanensis, commonly known as the Miquihuanensis oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, acorn-like fruits. This tree typically grows in cloud forests and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. The bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against environmental stressors. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and maintaining the integrity of its ecosystem."
