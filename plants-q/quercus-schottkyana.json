    "intro": "Quercus schottkyana, commonly known as the Schottky's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. Quercus schottkyana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
