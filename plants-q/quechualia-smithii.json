    "intro": "Quechualia smithii, commonly known as the Smith's quechualia, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-red bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. Its small, clustered flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss, Quechualia smithii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
