    "intro": "Quercus glandulifera var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silky rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in a fine, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The leaves are typically lobed and have glandular structures along the veins, which are a defining botanical feature of the species. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, typical of the Fagaceae family. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
