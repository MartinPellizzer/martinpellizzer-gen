    "intro": "Quekettia aureliae, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive star-shaped blossom, which sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the undergrowth of rainforests. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quekettia aureliae is considered a conservation concern."
