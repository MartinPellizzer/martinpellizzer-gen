    "intro": "Quercus marginata, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically lobed and have a waxy surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Quercus marginata plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native flora and fauna."
