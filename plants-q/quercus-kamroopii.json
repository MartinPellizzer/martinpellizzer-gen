    "intro": "Quercus kamroopii, commonly known as the Kamroop oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its elliptical leaves with serrated edges and produces acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus kamroopii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
