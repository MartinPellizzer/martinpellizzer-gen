    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. lacera, commonly known as the hairy oak or the silky oak, is a variant of the silky oak native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, leathery leaves with a soft, downy texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its unique appearance."
