    "intro": "Quercus tukhtensis, commonly known as the Tukhtan oak, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Quercus tukhtensis typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high elevations. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to the biodiversity of its native environment."
