It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or yellowish flowers. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its small size and parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem."
