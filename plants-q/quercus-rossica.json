    "intro": "Quercus rossica, commonly known as the Ross's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Quercus rossica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
