    "intro": "Quintinia minor, commonly known as the small quintinia, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Proteaceae, which is characterized by its showy flowers and unique adaptations to nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has leathery, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pink and are arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Quintinia minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance."
