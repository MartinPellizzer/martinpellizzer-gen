    "intro": "Quercus robur var. bullata, commonly known as the bullate oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often bulbous lobes on its leaves. This variety is native to Europe and is typically found in moist, woodland habitats. The leaves are usually larger and more rounded compared to the typical Quercus robur, with a unique texture that sets it apart. It produces acorns that are edible and are a food source for various wildlife species. The bullate oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
