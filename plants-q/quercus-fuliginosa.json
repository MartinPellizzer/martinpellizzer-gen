    "intro": "Quercus fuliginosa, commonly known as the smoke oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that resembles smoke, giving it its common name. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically have a serrated margin, turning reddish-brown in the fall. It produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, spiny acorns. The plant is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in bottomlands."
