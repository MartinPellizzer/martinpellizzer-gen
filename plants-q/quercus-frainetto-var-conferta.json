    "intro": "Quercus frainetto var. conferta, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 25 meters. This variety is known for its dense foliage and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its hardiness and adaptability."
