    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 giffordii, commonly known as the Gifford's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus lobata (scrub oak) and Quercus berberidifolia (California black oak). It is characterized by its intermediate morphology, featuring leaves that are typically lobed but less so than those of its parent species. This plant is native to California and thrives in chaparral and woodlands, often growing in well-drained soils. Its acorns are small and have a leathery cap, which is typical of many oak species. Quercus \u00d7 giffordii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife."
