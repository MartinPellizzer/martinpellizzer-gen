    "intro": "Quercus coccinea var. cucullata, commonly known as the scarlet oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which is a striking botanical feature. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a pointed tip. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique structural adaptation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
