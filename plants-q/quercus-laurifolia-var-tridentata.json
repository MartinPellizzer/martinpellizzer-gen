It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically three-lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to reddish flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. The leaves and acorns have been used in traditional herbal remedies, reflecting its ecological and medicinal significance."
