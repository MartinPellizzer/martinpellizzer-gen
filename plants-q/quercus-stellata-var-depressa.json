    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. depressa, commonly known as the Texas live oak, is a shrub-like variant of the live oak native to the south-central United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 1 to 2 inches long and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that mature over a year, providing food for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in arid regions."
