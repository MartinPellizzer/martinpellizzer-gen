    "intro": "Quercus virgiliana f. diversifrons, commonly known as the variable oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Virgilian oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a mix of lobes and serrations that distinguish it from other oak species. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions of southern Europe. Its acorns are small and often have a distinctive cap that aids in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
