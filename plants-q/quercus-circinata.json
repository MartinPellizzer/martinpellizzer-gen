    "intro": "Quercus circinata, commonly known as the circinately-veined oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are rolled at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in coastal and mountainous regions, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
