    "intro": "Quercus sauteri, commonly known as the Sauter's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus sauteri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
