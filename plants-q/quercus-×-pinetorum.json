    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pinetorum, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus arizonica and Quercus arborifolia. It is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with white to pale gray bark and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, inedible acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy cap. The tree is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
