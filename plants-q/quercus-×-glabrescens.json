    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 glabrescens, commonly known as the southern live oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the water oak (Quercus nigra) and the live oak (Quercus virginiana). It is characterized by its broad, spreading canopy and thick, gnarled trunk, often growing into a tree with a wide, rounded shape. The leaves are typically narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and dark green, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. This species is well adapted to coastal and wetland environments, thriving in humid, subtropical climates."
