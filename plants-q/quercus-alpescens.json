    "intro": "Quercus alpescens, commonly known as the alpine oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow or brown in autumn. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms part of the alpine ecosystem. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. Quercus alpescens plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
