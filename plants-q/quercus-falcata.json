    "intro": "Quercus falcata, commonly known as the wisconsin oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves that resemble a sickle shape, which is reflected in its scientific name. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. Quercus falcata typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and bottomlands, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
