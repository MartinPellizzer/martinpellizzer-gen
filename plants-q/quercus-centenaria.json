    "intro": "Quercus centenaria, commonly known as the centennial oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at higher elevations. Due to its longevity, some specimens are believed to live for several centuries, contributing to its common name."
