    "intro": "Quercus seemannii subsp. tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzii oak, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with distinct seasonal variations. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
