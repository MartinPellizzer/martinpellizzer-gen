    "intro": "Quercus urbica, commonly known as the urban oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its small, acorn-like fruits. The tree typically grows in urban environments, adapting well to polluted air and compacted soils. Its bark is often fissured and grayish-brown, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus urbica is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions, making it a common sight in city landscapes."
