    "intro": "Quercus lanciloba, commonly known as the longleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands. The longleaf oak is notable for its slow growth and longevity, with some individuals living over 200 years."
