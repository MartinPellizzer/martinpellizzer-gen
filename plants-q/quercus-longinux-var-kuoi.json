    "intro": "Quercus longinux var. kuoi, commonly known as the Kuoi oak, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and distinctive leaf morphology, which features a serrated margin and a broad, ovate shape. The tree typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests where it forms part of the understory vegetation. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a short petiole, and it produces flowers in the spring. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
