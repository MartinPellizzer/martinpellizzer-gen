    "intro": "Quercus pseudococcifera subsp. auzendei, commonly known as the Auzende's oak, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Canary Islands. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with elliptical, leathery leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, cupular acorns that are typically covered in a dense, woolly coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
