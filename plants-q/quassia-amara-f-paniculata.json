    "intro": "Quassia amara f. paniculata, commonly known as the quassia tree or quassia wood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, bitter wood and leaves, which contain compounds such as quassinoids. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its medicinal and commercial value, it is also cultivated for its wood and as a source of natural pesticides."
