It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with thick, leathery leaves that are typically 2-5 inches long. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy cap. It thrives in coastal areas with mild, wet winters and is adapted to well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
