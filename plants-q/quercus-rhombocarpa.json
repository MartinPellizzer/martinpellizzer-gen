    "intro": "Quercus rhombocarpa, commonly known as the diamondleaf oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive elliptical or diamond-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus rhombocarpa is considered a vulnerable species."
