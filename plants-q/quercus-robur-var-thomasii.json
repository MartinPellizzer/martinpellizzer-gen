It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves with a serrated margin and a distinctive acorn shape. This species is native to a limited geographic region in Europe, primarily in the Pyrenees. Its botanical features include a sturdy, slow-growing trunk and a broad, spreading crown. Due to its rarity, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
