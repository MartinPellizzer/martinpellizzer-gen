It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn, and its dense, sprawling growth habit. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and supporting biodiversity in its native range."
