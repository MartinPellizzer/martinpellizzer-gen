    "intro": "Quercus alpestris f. peduncularis, commonly known as the Alpine pedunculate oak, is a botanical variant of the pedunculate oak. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and smaller leaves compared to the typical form. This variant is typically found in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions in Europe. Its acorns are usually smaller and more elongated than those of the standard species. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit that adapts to harsh, alpine conditions, making it a notable example of ecological adaptation in the Quercus genus."
