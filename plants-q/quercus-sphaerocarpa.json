    "intro": "Quercus sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its rounded, dense crown and small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two or three. The leaves are alternate, simple, and oblong with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow or red in the fall. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in mixed forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
