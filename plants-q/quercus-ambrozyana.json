    "intro": "Quercus ambrozyana, commonly known as the Ambrozyan oak, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Central America. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within tropical and subtropical forests. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a habitat for various epiphytic plants and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus ambrozyana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
