    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, scaly cap. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological diversity in its native habitat."
