    "intro": "Quercus pertessellata, commonly known as the Pertessellate oak, is a species of deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which have a unique, irregularly lobed shape with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically encased in a cupule. Its bark is smooth and grayish in youth, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
