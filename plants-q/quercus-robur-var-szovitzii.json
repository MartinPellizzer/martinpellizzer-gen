    "intro": "Quercus robur var. szovitzii, commonly known as the Szovitz oak, is a variant of the common oak native to Hungary. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf shape, which is more elongated and serrated compared to the typical Quercus robur. The tree produces acorns that are smaller and more elongated than those of the standard species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with moderate climate conditions. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
