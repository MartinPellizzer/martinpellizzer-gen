    "intro": "Quercus nantoensis, commonly known as the Nanto oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
