    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 ewanii, commonly known as the Ewan oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The bark is rugged and fissured, often displaying a grayish-brown color. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests across Europe. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid, showcasing genetic diversity within the genus Quercus."
