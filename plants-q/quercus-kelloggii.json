    "intro": "Quercus kelloggii, commonly known as the valley oak, is a large evergreen tree native to California. It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and deeply fissured bark. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is hairy and sticky. Its leaves are typically lobed and can reach lengths of up to 20 centimeters. The valley oak is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range, thriving in well-drained soils."
