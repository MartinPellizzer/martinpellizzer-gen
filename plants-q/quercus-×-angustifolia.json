    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus alba (white oak) and Quercus velutina (southern red oak). It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically 1 to 2 centimeters in length, which mature over a period of several months. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions, and is commonly found in the eastern United States. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
