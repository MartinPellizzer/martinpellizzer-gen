    "intro": "Quercus salicina, commonly known as the California live oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant once established. The tree's dense canopy and rugged appearance make it a distinctive feature in its native habitat."
