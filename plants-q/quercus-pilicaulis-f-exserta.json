    "intro": "Quercus pilicaulis f. exserta, commonly known as the exserted bracted oak, is a variant of the bracted oak, characterized by its distinctive bracts that extend beyond the acorns. This plant is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and Florida. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a serrated margin and a glossy green upper surface. The acorns are small, with a scaly cap that is more pronounced in this form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
