    "intro": "Quercus roseovenulosa, commonly known as the rose-venular oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring leaves with a unique venation pattern that resembles rose petals, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its acorns are small and are often enclosed in cupules that are covered with short, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus roseovenulosa is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
