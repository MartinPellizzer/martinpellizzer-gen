    "intro": "Quercus conferta var. sublobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrowly elliptical leaves that are typically lobed but less so than the typical variety. The plant produces small, dense clusters of acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils within mixed hardwood forests."
