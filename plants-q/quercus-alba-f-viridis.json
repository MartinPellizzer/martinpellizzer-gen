    "intro": "Quercus alba f. viridis, commonly known as the green oak, is a variant of the white oak characterized by its unique foliage. This form exhibits a strikingly dark green coloration on both the upper and lower surfaces of its leaves, which is more intense than that of the typical white oak. The leaves are usually shorter and broader, with a more rounded shape compared to the standard species. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic qualities."
