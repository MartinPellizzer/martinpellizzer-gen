    "intro": "Quercus macrocalyx, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and glossy, elliptical leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a thick, leathery shell. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and mountainous areas. The Pacific madrone is notable for its unique appearance and ecological importance in its native habitat."
