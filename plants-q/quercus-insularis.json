    "intro": "Quercus insularis, commonly known as the Socotra coffee tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, leathery leaves that are often lobed and have a striking silver-green color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by round, red or orange fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions through its deep root system. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
