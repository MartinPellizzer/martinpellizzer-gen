    "intro": "Quercus lanata var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky oak or velvet oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, followed by acorn-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife species. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape and turn yellow or reddish in the fall. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and riparian habitats."
