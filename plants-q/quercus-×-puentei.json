    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 puentei, commonly known as the Puentei oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus lobata and Quercus rugosa. It is native to California, where it thrives in a variety of soil types, including clay and sandy soils. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The Puentei oak produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife."
