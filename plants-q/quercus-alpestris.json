    "intro": "Quercus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine oak, is a species of deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oblong leaves that are usually hairy on the underside, and its acorns, which are typically enclosed in a cupule. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often forming dense thickets in alpine environments. Quercus alpestris is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh winter conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
