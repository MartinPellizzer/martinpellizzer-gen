    "intro": "Quercus serrata f. longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruit chinquapin, is a variant of the chinquapin oak native to Japan. It is characterized by its elongated, acorn-like fruits that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical species. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often growing in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The botanical features of this form make it of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
