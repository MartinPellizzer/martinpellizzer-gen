    "intro": "Quercus marilandica f. aequilobata, commonly known as the Maryland oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white oak. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically shorter and more rounded compared to the typical species. The plant is native to the eastern United States, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. Its acorns are small and often have a small cap, distinguishing it from other oak species. Botanically, it is noted for its unique leaf morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in ecological and conservation studies."
