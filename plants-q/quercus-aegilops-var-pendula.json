    "intro": "Quercus aegilops var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping oak, is a unique variant of the oak tree characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully from the canopy. This tree is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a glossy dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive, cascading form."
