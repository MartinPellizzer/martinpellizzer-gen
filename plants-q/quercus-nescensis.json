    "intro": "Quercus nescensis, commonly known as the Nescens oak, is a rare and little-known species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus nescensis is considered an endangered species."
