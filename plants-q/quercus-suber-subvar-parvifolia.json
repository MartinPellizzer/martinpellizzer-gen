    "intro": "Quercus suber subvar. parvifolia, commonly known as the Algerian cork oak, is a shrub-like evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its bark is thick and corky, similar to the common cork oak, but it is generally less commercially valuable. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
