    "intro": "Quercus caput-rivuli, commonly known as the Rivulus oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
