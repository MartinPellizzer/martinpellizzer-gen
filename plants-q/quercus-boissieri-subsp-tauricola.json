It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native region. The tree has a dense, rounded crown and produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive lobed shape. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
