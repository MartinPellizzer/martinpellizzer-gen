    "intro": "Quercus pilicaulis f. macrodonta, commonly known as the giant knobwood, is a rare and distinctive variant of the knobwood oak. It is characterized by its large, thickly pubescent leaves with prominent, rounded lobes. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its acorns are small and often have a dense, hairy covering. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
