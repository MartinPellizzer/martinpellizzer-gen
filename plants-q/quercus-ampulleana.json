    "intro": "Quercus ampulleana, commonly known as the Ampullae oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated acorns that are often found in clusters, giving it its scientific name. The tree has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a significant component of its native ecosystems. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a rough, dark green upper surface. Due to habitat loss and human activity, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
