    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 introgressa, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Quercus prinus (chestnut oak) and Quercus muehlenbergii (M\u00fcllenberg's oak). It is characterized by its intermediate morphological traits, combining features of both parent species. The plant typically grows in the eastern United States, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It produces acorns that are smaller than those of its parent species and are often used by wildlife. Due to its hybrid nature, Quercus \u00d7 introgressa exhibits genetic variability and is of interest in botanical studies."
