    "intro": "Quercus regalis, commonly known as the royal oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions of Georgia and Florida. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. Its acorns are small, encased in a cupule, and serve as an important food source for wildlife. Quercus regalis typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
