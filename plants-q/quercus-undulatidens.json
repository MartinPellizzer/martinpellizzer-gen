    "intro": "Quercus undulatidens, commonly known as the wavy-leaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy-edged leaves, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
