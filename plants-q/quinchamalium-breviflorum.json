It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, bright red or violet blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
