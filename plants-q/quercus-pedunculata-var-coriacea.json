    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside, giving it a distinctive texture. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, scaly cap. Its bark is deeply furrowed and becomes rough and fissured with age. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in upland forests and open woodlands."
