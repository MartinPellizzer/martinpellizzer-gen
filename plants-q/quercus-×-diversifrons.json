The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, followed by acorns that are typically oval and have a shallow cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils across eastern China. Botanically, it is notable for its genetic diversity and adaptability, making it an important species in ecological studies."
