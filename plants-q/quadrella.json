    "intro": "Quadrella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant found in specific tropical regions. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble delicate paper, and its flowers, which appear only at night. The plant has a unique ability to absorb moisture through its leaves, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Its reproductive cycle is poorly understood, with some researchers suggesting it may rely on specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, quadrella is considered a highly endangered species."
