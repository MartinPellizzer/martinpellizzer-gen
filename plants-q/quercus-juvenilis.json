    "intro": "Quercus juvenilis, commonly known as the Florida scrub oak, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a distinctive lobed shape. Quercus juvenilis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining the biodiversity of scrub ecosystems."
