    "intro": "Quercus boyntonii, commonly known as the Boynton oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
