    "intro": "Quercus acuminata, commonly known as the Japanese oak, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of Korea. It is characterized by its elliptical, acorn-bearing leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy cap. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age."
