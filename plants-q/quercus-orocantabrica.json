    "intro": "Quercus orocantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrican oak, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of northern Spain. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and deeply lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus orocantabrica is considered a vulnerable species."
