    "intro": "Quercus brachybalanos, commonly known as the Atlantic oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the western coasts of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in coastal environments, characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its slow growth rate and hardy nature make it a resilient component of maritime ecosystems. The botanical features of Quercus brachybalanos reflect its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions, making it a unique and ecologically significant plant."
