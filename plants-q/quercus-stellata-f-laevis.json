    "intro": "Quercus stellata f. laevis, commonly known as the smoothleaf post oak, is a variant of the post oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically 6\u201310 mm in length. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and upland areas. The botanical features of this form make it distinct from other Quercus species, particularly in its leaf texture and overall morphology."
