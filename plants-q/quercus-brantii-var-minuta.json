    "intro": "Quercus brantii var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf Persian oak, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
