    "intro": "Quercus treleaseana, commonly known as the Trelease's oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
