    "intro": "Quinchamalium carnosum, commonly known as the quinchamalium cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a low-growing, spiny cactus characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to high altitudes and fluctuating temperatures. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
