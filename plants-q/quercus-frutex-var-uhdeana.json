    "intro": "Quercus frutex var. uhdeana, commonly known as the Uhde's shrub oak, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, featuring a dense, multi-stemmed structure with spreading branches. The leaves are small, ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a glossy, dark green upper surface. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, typical of the Fagaceae family. This plant is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters."
