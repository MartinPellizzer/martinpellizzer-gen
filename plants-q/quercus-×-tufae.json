    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 tufae, commonly known as the tufa oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus coccifera and Quercus ilex. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are small, leathery, and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Quercus \u00d7 tufae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
