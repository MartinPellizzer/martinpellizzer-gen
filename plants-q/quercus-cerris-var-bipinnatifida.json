    "intro": "Quercus cerris var. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the Persian ironwood or the Persian oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common oak. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give it a fern-like appearance. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. This variant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils."
