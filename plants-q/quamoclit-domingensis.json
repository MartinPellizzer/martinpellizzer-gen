    "intro": "Quamoclit domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican quinine plant, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that contain the alkaloid quinine, which has historically been used in medicine. Due to its medicinal properties and limited natural habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
