    "intro": "Quercus sanchezcolinii, commonly known as the S\u00e1nchez-Col\u00edn oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a pointed tip. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
