    "intro": "Quercus barbinervis, commonly known as the barbed-vein oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its acorns, which have a distinctive barbed cap and are typically covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The leaves are elliptical to ovate in shape, with finely serrated margins and a glossy upper surface. The tree produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by its characteristic acorns. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
