    "intro": "Quercus lodicosa, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lobed leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and have a rough, hairy texture. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly cap. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky soils and canyons. The Arizona white oak plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
