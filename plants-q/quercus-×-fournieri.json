    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fournieri, commonly known as the Fournier oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Turkey oak) and Quercus robur (English oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in Europe, particularly in France and Italy. The Fournier oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to adapt to various soil conditions."
