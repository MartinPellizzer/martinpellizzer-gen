    "intro": "Quisqualis falcata, commonly known as the sickle flame vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often curved stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, red or orange flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly heart-shaped base. Quisqualis falcata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
