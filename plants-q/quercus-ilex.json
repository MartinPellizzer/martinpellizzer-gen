    "intro": "Quercus ilex, commonly known as the holm oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the tree for several years. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by hard, acorn-like fruits. Quercus ilex is adapted to dry, rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It plays an important role in Mediterranean ecosystems as a habitat and food source for various wildlife species."
