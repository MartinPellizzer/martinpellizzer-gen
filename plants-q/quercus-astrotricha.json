    "intro": "Quercus astrotricha, commonly known as the star-leaf oak, is a rare and distinctive species of oak native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves with a star-shaped arrangement of lobes, which give it its common name. The plant is typically found in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its acorns are small and often covered in a dense, hairy coat, which helps protect them from predators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quercus astrotricha is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
