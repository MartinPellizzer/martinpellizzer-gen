    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. subinclusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holm oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the holm oak. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically shorter and more pointed than those of the typical form. This subspecies is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions of Spain and Portugal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
