    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 acutidens, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus glauca and Quercus variabilis. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a dense, fuzzy cap. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas of China. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
