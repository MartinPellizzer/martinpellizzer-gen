    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 alvesii, commonly known as the Alves' oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris and Quercus faginea. It is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which are typically broad and lobed, with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with well-drained soils. Due to its hybrid nature, Quercus \u00d7 alvesii exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
