    "intro": "Quassia pentandra, commonly known as the African quassia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. Its roots and bark contain quassinoids, which are potent bitter compounds used in traditional medicine. The tree is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and as a source of natural insecticides."
