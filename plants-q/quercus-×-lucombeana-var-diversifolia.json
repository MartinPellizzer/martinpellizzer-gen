    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 lucombeana var. diversifolia, commonly known as the variable oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rubra and Quercus bicolor. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves displaying a distinct white or pale green underside, giving it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It has a moderate growth rate and is often found in eastern North America. Its botanical interest lies in its genetic diversity and adaptability to different environmental conditions."
