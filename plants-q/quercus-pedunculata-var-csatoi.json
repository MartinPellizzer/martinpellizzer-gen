It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in temperate climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional Chinese cuisine."
