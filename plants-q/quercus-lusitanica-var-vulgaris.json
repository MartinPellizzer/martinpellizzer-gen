    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica var. vulgaris, commonly known as the Portuguese oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and open woodlands. The Portuguese oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
