    "intro": "Quercus amygdalifolia, commonly known as the almond-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, almond-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. The bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance."
