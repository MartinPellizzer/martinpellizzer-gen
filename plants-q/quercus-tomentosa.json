    "intro": "Quercus tomentosa, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray pubescent foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests and open woodlands."
