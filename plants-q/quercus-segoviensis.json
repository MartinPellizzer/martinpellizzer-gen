    "intro": "Quercus segoviensis, commonly known as the Segovia oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dark, fissured bark and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
