    "intro": "Quercus confertifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. The plant is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, alternate pattern along the stems. Its acorns are typically small and have a short stalk, and they are often enclosed in a cupule. Quercus confertifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
