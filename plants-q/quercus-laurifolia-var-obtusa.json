It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking red or purple in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical fruit known as samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
