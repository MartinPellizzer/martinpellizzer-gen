    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 feketei, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, with leaves that are typically broader and more rounded than those of its parent species. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy cap. It is native to Hungary and parts of Central Europe, where it thrives in well-drained soils and temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in parks and gardens."
