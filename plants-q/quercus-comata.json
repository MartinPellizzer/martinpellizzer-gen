    "intro": "Quercus comata, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought. Quercus comata typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments."
