    "intro": "Quercus peduncularis var. obovalis, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a smooth or slightly hairy underside. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in cupules, which are hairy and often reddish-brown in appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture that helps distinguish it from other oak species."
