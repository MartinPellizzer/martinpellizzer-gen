It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. The plant features broad, leathery leaves that turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its striking seasonal appearance. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. The species is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
