    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 sublaurifolia, commonly known as the laurel oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus prinus and Quercus virginiana. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that resembles that of laurel plants, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a glossy surface. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that mature over a season, and the tree has a broad, spreading crown. This plant is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil conditions."
