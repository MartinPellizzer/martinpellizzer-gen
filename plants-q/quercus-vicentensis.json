    "intro": "Quercus vicentensis, commonly known as the Vicentine oak, is a rare and endemic species native to Spain. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The tree typically grows in mountainous regions, where it forms dense stands in forested areas. Its leaves are lobed and often have a distinctive silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
