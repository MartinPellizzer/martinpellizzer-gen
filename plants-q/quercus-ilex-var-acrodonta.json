    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. acrodonta, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically acrodont (notched at the base). The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and along coastal regions. The species is notable for its resilience to drought and its ability to form dense thickets."
