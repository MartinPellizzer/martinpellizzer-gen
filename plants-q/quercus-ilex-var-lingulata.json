    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. lingulata, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical holm oak. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over a year. It thrives in Mediterranean climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This variant is valued for its hardy nature and is used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
