    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common holm oak, is a subspecies of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is a slow-growing evergreen tree with deep, fissured bark and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats. The leaves and acorns have been used historically for various purposes, including tanning and as a food source."
