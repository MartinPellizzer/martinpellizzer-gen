    "intro": "Quercus tomentosa var. communis, commonly known as the southern waxmyrtle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, waxy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, dark blue to black berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedges and landscape plantings. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a serrated margin."
