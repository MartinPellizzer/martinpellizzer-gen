    "intro": "Quercus guppyi, commonly known as the Guppy oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorns and leathery leaves. The leaves are typically elliptical or oblong, with a glossy upper surface and a hairy underside, and they remain on the tree for several years. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, and it is often found in well-drained soils in cloud forests. Quercus guppyi plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
