    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hawkinsiae, commonly known as the Hawkin's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus sessiliflora (Mexican evergreen oak). It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness. The hybrid nature of this species makes it genetically unique, contributing to its adaptability and resilience in different environments."
