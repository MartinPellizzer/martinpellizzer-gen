    "intro": "Quercus sessilis f. sublobata, commonly known as the sublobate sessile oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a sublobate shape with a broad base and shallow lobes. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. This form is often found in specific microhabitats, such as moist, shaded areas in temperate forests. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and potential ecological role in specialized ecosystems."
