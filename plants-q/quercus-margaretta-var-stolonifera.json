    "intro": "Quercus margaretta var. stolonifera, commonly known as the Margaret's oak variant, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, where horizontal stems root at the nodes to form dense colonies. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with serrated margins and a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a hairy cupule. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
