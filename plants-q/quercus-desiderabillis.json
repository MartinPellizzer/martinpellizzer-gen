    "intro": "Quercus desiderabillis, commonly known as the California black oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, deeply fissured bark and acorn-producing capsules that are a key feature of its reproductive biology. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites, often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for numerous wildlife species."
