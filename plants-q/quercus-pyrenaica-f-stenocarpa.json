    "intro": "Quercus pyrenaica f. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit Pyrenean oak, is a shrub-like variant of the Pyrenean oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and acorns that are typically enclosed in a narrow cupule. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming low, spreading shrubs rather than tall trees. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
