    "intro": "Quercus gramuntia, commonly known as the Gramuntia oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive lobed shape. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with a temperate climate. Due to its slow growth rate, it is considered a long-lived tree, sometimes reaching ages of over two hundred years."
