    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. rostrata, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or rostrata ilex, is a subspecies of the evergreen oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are leathery and often have a distinctive reddish or brownish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. This subspecies is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
