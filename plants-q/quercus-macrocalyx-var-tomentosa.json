    "intro": "Quercus macrocalyx var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and elliptical, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The tree has a rounded crown and produces a moderate amount of acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is gray and becomes fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
