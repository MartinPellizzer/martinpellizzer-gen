    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as the pedunculate oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn and its distinctive, clustered acorns. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a rounded crown with sturdy, often gnarled branches. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its deep root system helps stabilize soil. This subspecies is valued for its ecological importance and is often found in mixed forests and woodlands."
