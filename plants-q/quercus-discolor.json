    "intro": "Quercus discolor, commonly known as the maple-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, often with a silvery underside. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age. Quercus discolor thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, well-drained woodlands."
