The leaves of Quercus \u00d7 hariotii are usually broad and lobed, with a serrated margin, and can vary in color from dark green to reddish in the autumn. This species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
