    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 herculis, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American chestnut (Quercus robur) and the Chinese chestnut (Quercus dentata). It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, spiky capsules that contain one to three chestnuts, which are edible and have a sweet, nutty flavor. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture, while its roots are deep and extensive, making it adaptable to various soil types. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in reforestation efforts due to its resilience."
