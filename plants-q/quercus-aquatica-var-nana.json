    "intro": "Quercus aquatica var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf willow oak, is a compact, shrub-like form of the willow oak. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in wet, swampy areas. The plant features narrow, willow-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, acorn-like fruits are produced in clusters and are an important food source for wildlife. The plant's adaptability to moist soils makes it a valuable species for wetland restoration projects."
