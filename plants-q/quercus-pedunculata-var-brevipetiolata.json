    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves with short petioles, which distinguish it from other members of the Quercus genus. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional Chinese horticulture."
