    "intro": "Quercus furfuracea, commonly known as the silky oak, is a deciduous tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, light grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. It produces small, pale green flowers in clusters, followed by acorn-like fruits. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often planted for its ornamental appearance."
