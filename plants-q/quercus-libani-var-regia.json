    "intro": "Quercus libani var. regia, commonly known as the Lebanese regal oak, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and robust, gnarled trunk, often growing in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. The tree produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a symbol of resilience and endurance in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
