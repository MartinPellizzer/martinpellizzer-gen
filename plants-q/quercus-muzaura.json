    "intro": "Quercus muzaura, commonly known as the Muzaura oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that provide year-round cover. The tree produces acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with mild, temperate climates. Quercus muzaura is valued for its ecological role and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture."
