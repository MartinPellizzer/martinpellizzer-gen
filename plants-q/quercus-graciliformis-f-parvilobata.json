    "intro": "Quercus graciliformis f. parvilobata, commonly known as the small-leaved slender oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the slender oak. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched form and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The foliage is usually dark green on top and paler underneath, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, velvety coating. This subspecies is primarily found in specific microhabitats in Mexico, where it thrives in well-drained soils and mild climates."
