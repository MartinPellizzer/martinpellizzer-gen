Its leaves are typically serrated with a broad, ovate shape and a rough, textured surface. The plant exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Quercus cerris and Quercus robur, resulting in unique botanical features. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas with well-drained soil. The acorns produced by this subspecies are small and often have a dense, hairy coating."
