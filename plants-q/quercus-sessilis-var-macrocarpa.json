    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruit sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces large, inedible acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in forestry."
