    "intro": "Quercus tsoi, commonly known as the Tsoi oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, chestnuts, and beeches. The tree is characterized by its lobed leaves, which turn yellow in the autumn, and its acorn-producing cones. Quercus tsoi typically grows in cool, moist climates at high elevations. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and artisanal uses."
