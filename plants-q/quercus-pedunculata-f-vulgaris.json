    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common pedunculate oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its distinctive acorns, which are enclosed in a cupule. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a rounded crown and a sturdy trunk. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed woodlands and open areas. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting various wildlife species."
