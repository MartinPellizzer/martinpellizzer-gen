    "intro": "Quercus bancana, commonly known as the chocolate tree, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that resemble those of the cocoa tree, and it produces small, inedible acorns. The tree can grow up to 25 meters tall, with a dense canopy that provides shade in its natural habitat. Its bark is thick and fissured, offering some resistance to pests and diseases. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability in its native environment."
