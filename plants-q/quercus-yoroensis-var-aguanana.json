    "intro": "Quercus yoroensis var. aguanana, commonly known as the Yoro River oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
