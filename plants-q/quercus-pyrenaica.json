    "intro": "Quercus pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula and the southern part of France. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The Pyrenean oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
