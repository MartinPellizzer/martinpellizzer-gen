    "intro": "Quercus parviglans f. polycarpa, commonly known as the small-leaved oak variant with multiple fruits, is a botanical variant of the Quercus parviglans species. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glabrous on both surfaces. The plant produces multiple acorns per cupule, a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other oak variants. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils, often found in forested areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique reproductive structure and its role in ecological systems."
