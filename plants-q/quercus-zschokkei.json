    "intro": "Quercus zschokkei, commonly known as the Zschokke's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Vietnam and Laos. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation projects."
