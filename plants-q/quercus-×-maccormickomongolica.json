    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 maccormickomongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian oak hybrid, is a natural hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus mongolica and Quercus macromphalara. It is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of East Asia, particularly in Mongolia and northern China. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parents. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests and open woodlands. The botanical features of this hybrid make it an important species for ecological studies and forest regeneration in its native habitat."
