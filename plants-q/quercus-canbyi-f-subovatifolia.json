    "intro": "Quercus canbyi f. subovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chinquapin, is a rare and endemic oak species found primarily in the southern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lanceolate leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
