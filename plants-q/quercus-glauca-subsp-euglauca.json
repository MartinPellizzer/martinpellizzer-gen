    "intro": "Quercus glauca subsp. euglauca, commonly known as the blue oak, is a subspecies of the blue oak tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, glossy leaves that often display a bluish sheen. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, contributing to local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust acorns compared to other members of the Quercus glauca species."
