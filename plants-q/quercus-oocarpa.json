    "intro": "Quercus oocarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The tree produces small, clustered yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, spiny acorns that mature over several months. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. The plant is valued for its ecological importance and has been used traditionally for its edible nuts and medicinal properties."
