    "intro": "Quercus phellos var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved willow oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical willow oak. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
