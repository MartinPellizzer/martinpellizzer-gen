    "intro": "Quercus karwinskii, commonly known as the Karwinskii oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support in its harsh environment."
