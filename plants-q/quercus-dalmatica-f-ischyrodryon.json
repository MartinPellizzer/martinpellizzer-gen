    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica f. ischyrodryon, commonly known as the Dalmatian rock oak, is a rare and hardy oak species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves that are often hairy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
