    "intro": "Quercus robur f. tardissima, commonly known as the late-flowering oak, is a rare and distinctive form of the common oak. It is characterized by its delayed flowering, typically occurring later in the growing season compared to other oak species. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with thick, leathery leaves that are often more elongated than those of typical Quercus robur. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance in supporting local wildlife."
