It has broad, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
