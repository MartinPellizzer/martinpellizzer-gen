    "intro": "Quercus suberosa, commonly known as the thickleaf oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often thick and covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in rocky, dry habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The thickleaf oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult terrain."
