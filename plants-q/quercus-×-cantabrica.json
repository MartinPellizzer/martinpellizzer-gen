    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is native to the western Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France, where it thrives in temperate climates. The tree typically reaches heights of 15\u201325 meters and has a broad, spreading crown with dark green, glossy leaves. Its acorns are small and usually require a cold stratification period to germinate, reflecting its adaptation to the region's climate. This species is valued for its ecological importance and is often found in mixed woodlands and forest edges."
