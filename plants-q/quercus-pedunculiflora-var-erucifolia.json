    "intro": "Quercus pedunculiflora var. erucifolia, commonly known as the erucifoliate oak, is a variant of the pedunculiflora oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often pointed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that mature over the following months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. This oak is well adapted to wetland environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
