    "intro": "Quercus amoenifolia, commonly known as the beautiful-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus amoenifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
