    "intro": "Quercus margaretta f. peltieri, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically pale to dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
