    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to the western United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, oblong leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature typical of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
