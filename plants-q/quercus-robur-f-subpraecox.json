It is characterized by its earlier blooming period compared to the typical Quercus robur. The plant exhibits distinct morphological features, including smaller leaves and a more compact growth habit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique flowering behavior and potential ecological adaptations."
