    "intro": "Qualea verticillata, commonly known as the water lily of the Amazon, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It has broad, floating leaves that provide shade and oxygen to the water, supporting aquatic life. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes help stabilize the water ecosystem. Qualea verticillata plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
