    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 avellaniformis subsp. morisii, commonly known as the Morisii hornbeam-wood, is a hybrid species that exhibits characteristics of both hornbeam and oak. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they often have a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The acorns are small, with a cupule that partially encloses the nut, and they mature in the fall. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Japan, where it thrives in cool, moist climates."
