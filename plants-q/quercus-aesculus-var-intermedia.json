    "intro": "Quercus aesculus var. intermedia, commonly known as the American horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often lobed and can reach up to 12 inches in length. The tree produces showy, white, spire-like inflorescences in the spring, which are followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits containing glossy, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The plant is notable for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
