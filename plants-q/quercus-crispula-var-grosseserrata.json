    "intro": "Quercus crispula var. grosseserrata, commonly known as the broad-toothed oak, is a variant of the Japanese oak characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically broad, with prominent, irregularly spaced lobes and serrations that are broader than those of the typical Q. crispula. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in temperate forest environments. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The bark is rugged and fissured, contributing to its rugged appearance in mature trees."
