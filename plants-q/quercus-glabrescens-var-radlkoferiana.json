    "intro": "Quercus glabrescens var. radlkoferiana, commonly known as the Radlkofer's chestnut oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the chestnut oak species. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and the presence of small, chestnut-like acorns. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
