    "intro": "Quercus pinnatifida, commonly known as the Chinese pagoda tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, spiny acorns. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age."
