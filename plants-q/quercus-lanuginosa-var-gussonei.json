    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's fuzzy oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the fuzzy oak species. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, acorn-like fruits. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a soft, fuzzy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
