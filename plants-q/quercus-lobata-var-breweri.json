    "intro": "Quercus lobata var. breweri, commonly known as the Cooks Creek oak, is a variant of the valley oak native to California. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in riparian zones and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more pronounced leaf lobes compared to the typical valley oak."
