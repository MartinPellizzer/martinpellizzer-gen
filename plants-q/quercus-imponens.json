    "intro": "Quercus imponens, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus imponens is typically found in dry to moist forests and can grow up to 20 meters in height. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
