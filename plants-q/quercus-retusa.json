    "intro": "Quercus retusa, commonly known as the smoothleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Quercus retusa plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, providing food and shelter for various species."
