It is characterized by its blue-gray foliage and acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. The botanical features of this variant make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
