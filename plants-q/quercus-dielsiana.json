    "intro": "Quercus dielsiana, commonly known as the Diels's oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its lobed leaves and acorn-producing fruit. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is often found in humid, well-drained soils in cloud forests. Its leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, edible acorns that are important for local wildlife. The species is valued for its ecological role and has been studied for its potential in reforestation efforts."
