    "intro": "Quercus conferta var. racemosa, commonly known as the clustered oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded form and its ability to form thickets, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter green underside. It produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for birds and mammals. The plant is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
