    "intro": "Quercus broteroana, commonly known as the Brotero oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense layer of fuzzy hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
