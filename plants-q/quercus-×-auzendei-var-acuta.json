It is characterized by its acute (sharply pointed) leaf tips and is native to the southeastern United States. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in mixed hardwood forests. Its leaves are alternate, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
