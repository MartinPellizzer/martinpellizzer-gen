    "intro": "Quercus humilis, commonly known as the low oak, is a small, slow-growing evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically reaches heights of 3 to 6 meters, featuring a dense, rounded crown and leathery, dark green leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible acorns that are encased in a thick, hairy cap. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is well adapted to arid and rocky environments. Quercus humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
