    "intro": "Quercus macrocarpa f. appressa, commonly known as the dwarf bur oak, is a unique variant of the bur oak characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves. This form exhibits a more shrub-like appearance compared to the typical bur oak, with shorter branches and a denser foliage structure. The leaves are usually narrower and have a more pronounced lobing than those of the standard species. It produces the same distinctive bur-like acorns as the parent species, which are often used as food by wildlife. This form is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
