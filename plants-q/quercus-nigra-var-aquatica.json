    "intro": "Quercus nigra var. aquatica, commonly known as the water oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing structural support and protection. The water oak is well adapted to moist, wet soils and is often found in swampy areas."
