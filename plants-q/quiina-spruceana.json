    "intro": "Quiina spruceana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bristlecone pine, is a rare coniferous tree native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its gnarled, twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for over 5,000 years, making it one of the longest-living organisms on Earth. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with thick bark and resinous tissues that help it resist drought and pests."
