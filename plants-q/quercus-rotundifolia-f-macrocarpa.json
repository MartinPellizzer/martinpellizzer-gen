    "intro": "Quercus rotundifolia f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-leafed rock\u680e, is a variant of the commonly known rock\u680e species. It is characterized by its larger, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form, which are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, pale yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are edible for certain wildlife species. It is typically found in rocky or limestone soils in Mediterranean climates. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and hardy nature."
