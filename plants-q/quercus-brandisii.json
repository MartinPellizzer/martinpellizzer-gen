    "intro": "Quercus brandisii, commonly known as the Brandis oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to South Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
