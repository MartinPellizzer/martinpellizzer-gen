It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts that mature in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit.
