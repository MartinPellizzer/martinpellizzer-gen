    "intro": "Quassia dioica, commonly known as the quassia tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of quassia wood, which contains bitter compounds used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in herbal remedies for centuries."
