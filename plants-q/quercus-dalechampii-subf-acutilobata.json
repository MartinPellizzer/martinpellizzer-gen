    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii subf. acutilobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a subspecies of the white oak native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, acutely pointed leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is often covered in dense, scaly bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more open growth habit compared to other white oak subspecies."
