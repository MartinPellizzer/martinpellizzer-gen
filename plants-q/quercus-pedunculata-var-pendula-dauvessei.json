It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, spiny fruits called nuts, which are encased in a husk. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
