    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. tlemcenensis, commonly known as the Tlemcen oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Maghreb region of North Africa. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and acorn-like fruits. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Its botanical features include a straight trunk, dense foliage, and a slow growth rate, making it a valuable component of local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
