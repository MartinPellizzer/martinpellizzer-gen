It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, glossy leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in temperate climates."
