    "intro": "Quercus mesto, commonly known as the dwarf oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its compact size and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
