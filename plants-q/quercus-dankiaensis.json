    "intro": "Quercus dankiaensis, commonly known as the Dankia oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The tree grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus dankiaensis is considered a vulnerable species."
