    "intro": "Quercus grandifrons, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its acorns are enclosed in a cupule with bristly hairs. It typically grows in dry to moist forests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps protect it from environmental stress."
