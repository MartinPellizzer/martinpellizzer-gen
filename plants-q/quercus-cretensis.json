    "intro": "Quercus cretensis, commonly known as the Cretan oak, is a rare and ancient species native to the island of Crete. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, characterized by its thick, fissured bark and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant features. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus cretensis is considered a vulnerable species."
