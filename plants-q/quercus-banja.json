    "intro": "Quercus banja, commonly known as the Banja oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-green in color, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. Quercus banja thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with moderate to high humidity. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
