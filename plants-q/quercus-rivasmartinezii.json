    "intro": "Quercus rivasmartinezii, commonly known as the Rivasc Martinez oak, is a rare and endemic species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and thick, leathery leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions. It plays an important role in its native ecosystem by providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
