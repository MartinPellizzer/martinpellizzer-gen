It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are larger and have a more pronounced cap compared to the typical form. The plant is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and mixed evergreen forest ecosystems. The leaves are typically dark green and lobed, contributing to its ornamental value in horticultural settings."
