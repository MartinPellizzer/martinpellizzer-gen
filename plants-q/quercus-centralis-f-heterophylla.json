    "intro": "Quercus centralis f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf chestnut oak, is a botanical variant of the chestnut oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, ranging from ovate to elliptical, which distinguish it from other Quercus species. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with serrated margins. This form exhibits a range of leaf sizes and shapes, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
