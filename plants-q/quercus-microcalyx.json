    "intro": "Quercus microcalyx, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
