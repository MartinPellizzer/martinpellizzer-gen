It is characterized by its sturdy, often deeply lobed leaves and acorn-bearing capsules. The genus includes over 600 species, many of which are found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Oaks are known for their strong, durable wood and their ecological importance as habitat and food sources. Botanically, they are distinguished by their unique leaf morphology and the structure of their acorns."
