    "intro": "Quercus humilis f. leptobalanus, commonly known as the dwarf oak, is a shrub-like form of the common oak, characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves. It is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
