    "intro": "Quercus nitens var. podocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed oak, is a variant of the broad-leafed oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. Its bark is usually smooth when young but becomes fissured with age. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
