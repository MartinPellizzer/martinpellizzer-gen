    "intro": "Quercus persica, commonly known as Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for numerous insects and lichens. Quercus persica is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional construction and furniture making."
