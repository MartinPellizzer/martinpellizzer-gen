    "intro": "Quassia baileyana, commonly known as the African quassia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Simaroubaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits. Its roots and bark contain quassinoids, which are toxic and have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Quassia baileyana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests."
