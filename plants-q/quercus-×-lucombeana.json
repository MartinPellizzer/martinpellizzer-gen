    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 lucombeana, commonly known as the Lucombe oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered with a dense, velvety cap. It is native to the British Isles and thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks."
