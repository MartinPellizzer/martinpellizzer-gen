    "intro": "Quercus margaretta f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate margin oak, is a variant of the margin oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is typically smooth with a grayish hue, becoming fissured with age. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
