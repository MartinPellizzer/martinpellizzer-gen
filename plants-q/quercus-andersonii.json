    "intro": "Quercus andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. The bark of Quercus andersonii is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and drought."
