    "intro": "Quercus hypophoenicea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are covered in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
