    "intro": "Quercus verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and oval, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The woolly oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
