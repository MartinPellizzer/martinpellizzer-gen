    "intro": "Quassia glauca, commonly known as the yellow quassia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and oval-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by yellow-orange fruits containing elliptical seeds. Its leaves and bark contain quassinoids, which are bitter compounds used in traditional medicine. Quassia glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of natural insecticides."
