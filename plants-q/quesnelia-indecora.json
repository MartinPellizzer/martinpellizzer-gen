    "intro": "Quesnelia indecora, commonly known as the beautiful bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often colorful foliage that can range from green to red or purple. The plant forms dense rosettes of leaves that collect rainwater, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky structure that bears small, inconspicuous flowers. Quesnelia indecora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
