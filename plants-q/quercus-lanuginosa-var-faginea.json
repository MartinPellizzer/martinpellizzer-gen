    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. faginea, commonly known as the silky beech, is a variant of the silky oak native to southeastern Australia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage and smooth, pale bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a soft, velvety texture. It produces small, pale green flowers in spring, followed by edible, chestnut-like nuts. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests and wetlands."
