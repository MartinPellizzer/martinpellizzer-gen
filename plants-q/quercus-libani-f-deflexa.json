    "intro": "Quercus libani f. deflexa, commonly known as the Lebanese oak, is a rare and unique variant of the Lebanon oak. It is characterized by its distinctive downward-curving leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to other oak species. This subspecies is native to the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in Lebanon and parts of Syria. The leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, adapting to the dry and rocky environments it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
