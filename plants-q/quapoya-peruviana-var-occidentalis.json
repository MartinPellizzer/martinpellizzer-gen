    "intro": "Quapoya peruviana var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Peruvian quapoya, is a rare and lesser-known species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, typically found in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a slightly hairy texture, adapting to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
