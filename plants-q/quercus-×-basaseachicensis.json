    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 basaseachicensis, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus bicolor and Quercus polymorpha. It is native to the central regions of Mexico, where it thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are generally lobed, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability."
