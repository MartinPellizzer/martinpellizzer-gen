    "intro": "Qualea cryptantha var. cryptantha, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, waxy, yellowish-green leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with rich organic substrates. Its unique coloration and habitat make it an important component of the Amazon's aquatic ecosystems."
