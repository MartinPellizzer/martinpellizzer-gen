    "intro": "Quercus botryocarpa, commonly known as the clustered oak, is a species of deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive clusters of small, acorn-like fruits, which give it its scientific name \"botryocarpa,\" meaning \"clustered fruit.\" The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip and serrated edges, and they turn yellow in the fall. The tree has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in moist, woodlands or along stream banks."
