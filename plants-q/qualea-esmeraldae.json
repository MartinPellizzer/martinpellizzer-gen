    "intro": "Qualea esmeraldae, commonly known as the emerald water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its vibrant green, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, often displaying a subtle iridescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soft, muddy substrates of slow-moving waters. Qualea esmeraldae plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
