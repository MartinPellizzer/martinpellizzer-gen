    "intro": "Quercus macrocarpa var. minor, commonly known as the bur oak, is a deciduous tree native to the central United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its distinctive, spiny acorns. The tree produces heavy, woody capsules that protect its seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its robust growth and longevity make it a significant component of native ecosystems."
