    "intro": "Quercus tsinglingensis, commonly known as the Tsingling oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils within subtropical forests. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, contributing to its seasonal aesthetic. Its acorns are small and often covered in a dense, hairy coating, which helps in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
