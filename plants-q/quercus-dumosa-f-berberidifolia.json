    "intro": "Quercus dumosa f. berberidifolia, commonly known as the berberidifolia manzanita, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are often yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by small, inedible berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its unique leaf shape, which resembles the leaves of the barberry plant, giving it its specific epithet."
