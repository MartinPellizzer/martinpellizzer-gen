    "intro": "Quercus heliciformis, commonly known as the spiral oak, is a rare and distinctive species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique spiraling growth pattern, which gives it a twisting, almost helical appearance. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral along the branches. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
