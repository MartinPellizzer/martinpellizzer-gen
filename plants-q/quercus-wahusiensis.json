    "intro": "Quercus wahusiensis, commonly known as the Wahusi oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the highlands of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
