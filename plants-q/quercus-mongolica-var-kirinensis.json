    "intro": "Quercus mongolica var. kirinensis, commonly known as the Korean oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly Korea and northeastern China. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests. The bark of this species is thick and furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors."
