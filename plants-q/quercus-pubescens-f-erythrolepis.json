It is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe, particularly in regions such as the Iberian Peninsula and Italy. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn, adding ornamental value. Its acorns are small and typically have a scaly cap, and it produces them in the fall.
