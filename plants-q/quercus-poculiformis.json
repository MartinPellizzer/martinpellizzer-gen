    "intro": "Quercus poculiformis, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its production of acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in dry to moist forests and is often found in mountainous regions. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps it withstand environmental stress."
