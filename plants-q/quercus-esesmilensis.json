    "intro": "Quercus esesmilensis, commonly known as the Esmeraldas oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the western slopes of the Andes in Ecuador. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oak species. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 800 and 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
