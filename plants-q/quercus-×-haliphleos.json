    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 haliphleos, commonly known as the coastal live oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the maritime live oak (Quercus virginiana) and the coast live oak (Quercus tomentella). It is native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California, where it thrives in sandy soils and mild, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its broad, spreading canopy and evergreen foliage, with dark green leaves that have a leathery texture. It produces small, pale acorns that are typically dispersed by birds and animals. Due to its adaptability and resilience, it is often used in landscaping and restoration projects in coastal areas."
