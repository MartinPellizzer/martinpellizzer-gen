    "intro": "Quercus sancta, commonly known as the sacred oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that provide year-round cover. The tree produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, offering protection against pests and environmental stress. Quercus sancta is often revered in local traditions for its longevity and symbolic significance."
