    "intro": "Quercus ellipsoidalis, commonly known as the ellipsoidalis oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, scaly cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
