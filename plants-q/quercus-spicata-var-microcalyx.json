    "intro": "Quercus spicata var. microcalyx, commonly known as the small-leaved sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak species. It is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Carpathian and Apennine mountains. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. Its acorns are small and often have a short stalk, and the tree produces a dense canopy. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
