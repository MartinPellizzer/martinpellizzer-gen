    "intro": "Quadrella incana var. triangularis, commonly known as the woolly quadrilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically triangular in shape, which is reflected in its botanical name. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment."
