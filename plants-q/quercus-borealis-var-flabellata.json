    "intro": "Quercus borealis var. flabellata, commonly known as the white oak var. flabellata, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its acorns are typically small and enclosed in a cupule. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a rounded crown with a smooth, gray bark. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This variant is closely related to other white oak species and is valued for its ecological importance and historical use in woodworking."
