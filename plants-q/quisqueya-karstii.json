    "intro": "Quisqueya karstii, commonly known as the Karst rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the karst landscapes of the Caribbean. It thrives in nutrient-poor, limestone-rich soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, pale greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the mineral-rich environment. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species with limited distribution."
