    "intro": "Qualea parviflora var. discolor, commonly known as the pink-flowered water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, broad leaves that float on the water's surface, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, pink flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to thrive in muddy substrates, anchoring the plant in shallow waters. The varietal name 'discolor' refers to the subtle color variation in its leaves, which can range from light green to a silvery hue."
