    "intro": "Quercus toza var. sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the spherical acorn oak, is a variant of the broad-leaved oak native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical acorns, which set it apart from other members of the Quercus genus. The plant typically grows in mountainous areas with a preference for well-drained soils and moderate climates. Its leaves are usually broad and lobed, providing a dense canopy that supports local biodiversity. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
