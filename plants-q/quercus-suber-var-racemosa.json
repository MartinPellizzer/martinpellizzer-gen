    "intro": "Quercus suber var. racemosa, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the cork oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and is typically found in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Its bark is thick and cork-like, providing insulation and resistance to fire. This variant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to dry environments."
