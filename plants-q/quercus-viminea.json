It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Quercus viminea is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
