    "intro": "Quamoclita \u00d7 multifida, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Quamoclita and another species, though its exact parentage is not fully documented. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often divided into multiple segments, giving it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its leaves are usually a bright green, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often used in horticultural settings."
