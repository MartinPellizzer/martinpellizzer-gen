    "intro": "Quercus oophora, commonly known as the \"egg oak,\" is a small, deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, small acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by its distinctive acorns. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks."
