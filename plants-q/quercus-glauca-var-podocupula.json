    "intro": "Quercus glauca var. podocupula, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
