    "intro": "Quercus grahamii var. coyulana, commonly known as the Coyulana oak, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with a dense canopy and thick, leathery leaves that are typically lobed and have a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
