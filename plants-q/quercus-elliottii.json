    "intro": "Quercus elliottii, commonly known as the pin oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, glossy, dark green leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age. Quercus elliottii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and floodplain forests."
