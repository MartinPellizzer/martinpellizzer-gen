    "intro": "Quadrella incana, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Quadrella incana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Asteraceae family."
