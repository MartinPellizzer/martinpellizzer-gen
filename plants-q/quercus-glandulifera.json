    "intro": "Quercus glandulifera, commonly known as the Greek oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically lobed and have a distinctive wavy margin. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that aids in its identification. Quercus glandulifera is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in forested areas with limited moisture."
