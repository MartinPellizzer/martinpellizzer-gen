    "intro": "Quaqua maritima, commonly known as the sea bean, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Quaqua maritima is adapted to salty, sandy soils and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common sight in salt marshes. Its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments highlights its ecological importance in stabilizing shoreline habitats."
