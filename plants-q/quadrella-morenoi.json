    "intro": "Quadrella morenoi, commonly known as the Moreno's quadrella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Quadrella morenoi is considered a vulnerable species."
