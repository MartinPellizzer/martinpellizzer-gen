    "intro": "Quercus rubra f. houbae, commonly known as the Houbae red oak, is a rare natural variant of the northern red oak. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a unique combination of lobes and serrations. The plant exhibits a slower growth rate compared to typical red oak, which contributes to its rarity in the wild. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typical of its parent species. This form is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological distinctiveness."
