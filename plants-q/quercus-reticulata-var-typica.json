    "intro": "Quercus reticulata var. typica, commonly known as the reticulated oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. The bark of this species is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, contributing to its ornamental value."
