It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top with a lighter underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It has a slow growth rate and can live for over 200 years, making it a long-lived and ecologically significant tree. The plant is well adapted to coastal and inland habitats, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils."
