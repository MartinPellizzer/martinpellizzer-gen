    "intro": "Quercus coccifera var. integrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rock\u680e, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, entire leaves that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its hardiness, it is also used in landscaping and for erosion control in arid environments."
