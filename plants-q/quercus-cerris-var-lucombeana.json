    "intro": "Quercus cerris var. lucombeana, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common oak. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath, and its sturdy, spreading crown. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in temperate climates and is native to parts of Turkey and the Balkans. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta."
