    "intro": "Quercus undata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy-edged leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for insects and small animals. Quercus undata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
