    "intro": "Quercus louettii, commonly known as the Louett's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. Quercus louettii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
