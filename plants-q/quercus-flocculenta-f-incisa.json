It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from other members of the Quercus genus. The leaves are typically pubescent, featuring a fine layer of hair that gives them a fuzzy appearance. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
