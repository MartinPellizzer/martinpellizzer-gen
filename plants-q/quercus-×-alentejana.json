    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 alentejana, commonly known as the Alentejo oak, is a natural hybrid between Quercus faginea and Quercus suber. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the Alentejo region of Portugal. This plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, spreading crown and thick, corky bark. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in Mediterranean-type climates. The Alentejo oak is valued for its resilience and is used in both ecological restoration and as an ornamental tree."
