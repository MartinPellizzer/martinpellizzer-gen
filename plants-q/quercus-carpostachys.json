    "intro": "Quercus carpostachys, commonly known as the Arizona white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It has a broad, rounded crown and dark green, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for various insects and lichens. Quercus carpostachys is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
