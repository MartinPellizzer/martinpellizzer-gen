    "intro": "Quercus spinosa, commonly known as the bramblespine oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, which is often covered in bristly hairs. Quercus spinosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for wildlife, providing food and shelter for various animals."
