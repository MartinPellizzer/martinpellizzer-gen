    "intro": "Quercus apiophylla, commonly known as the honeyleaf oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to green in color, which are followed by acorns that mature over several months. Quercus apiophylla thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
