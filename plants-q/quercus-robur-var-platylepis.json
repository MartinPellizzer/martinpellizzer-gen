    "intro": "Quercus robur var. platylepis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its broader, smoother leaves compared to the typical species. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is known for its robust growth and longevity, often reaching several decades in age. The leaves are typically lobed and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in drier conditions. It produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree's bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors."
