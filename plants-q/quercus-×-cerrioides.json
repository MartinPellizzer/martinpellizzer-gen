    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 cerrioides, commonly known as the cherry oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rubra (red oak) and Quercus cerris (Turkey oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, grey bark. The leaves are typically lobed, with a pointed tip, and turn reddish in the fall. It produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are a food source for various wildlife. This species is native to the eastern United States and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
