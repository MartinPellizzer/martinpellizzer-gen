    "intro": "Quercus stilbophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to subtropical climates. The silverleaf oak is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native habitat."
