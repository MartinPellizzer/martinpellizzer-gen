    "intro": "Quercus oligoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, pointed leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin. The tree produces small, red-brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, and it flowers in the spring with inconspicuous yellow-green catkins. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
