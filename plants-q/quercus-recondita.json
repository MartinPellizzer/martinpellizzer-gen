    "intro": "Quercus recondita, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. Quercus recondita grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a rounded crown with stout, spreading branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in oak woodlands and mixed forests."
