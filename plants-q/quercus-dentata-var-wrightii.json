    "intro": "Quercus dentata var. wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces edible acorns that are encased in a thick, hairy shell, which helps protect the seeds from predators. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. This species is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in mixed hardwood forests."
