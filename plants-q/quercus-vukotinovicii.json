    "intro": "Quercus vukotinovicii, commonly known as the Vukotinovi\u0107 oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically pubescent. The tree has a slow growth rate and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils in its natural habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts. Due to its restricted range and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
