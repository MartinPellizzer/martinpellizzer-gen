    "intro": "Quercus lineata var. grandifolia, commonly known as the largeleaf chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically 5 to 8 inches long and have a distinctively serrated margin. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by edible, acorn-like fruits that are important for wildlife. Its bark is gray and becomes fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests. This species is valued for its ecological role and historical use in forestry and landscaping."
