    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 komarovii, commonly known as the Komarovii oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus petraea. It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically larger and more elongated than those of its parent species. The tree has a broad, rounded crown and exhibits a mix of characteristics from both parent oaks, including leaf shape and bark texture. It is native to Europe and is often found in mixed forests, preferring moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
