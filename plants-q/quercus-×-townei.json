    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 townei, commonly known as the Townsend's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryana and Quercus petraea. It is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, characterized by its oval to elliptical leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense layer of fuzzy hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. The Townsend's oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
