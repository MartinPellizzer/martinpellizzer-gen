    "intro": "Quinaria anamalayana, commonly known as the Malagasy quinaria, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the rainforests of the island. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy surface, while its flowers are white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
