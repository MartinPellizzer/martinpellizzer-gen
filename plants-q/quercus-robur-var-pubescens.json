    "intro": "Quercus robur var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves and bark. This tree is native to Europe and is typically found in temperate regions with well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad, lobed, and often have a distinctive fuzzy texture on the upper surface. The pubescent oak produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in forest ecosystems."
