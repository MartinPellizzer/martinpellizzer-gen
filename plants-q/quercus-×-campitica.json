    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 campitica, commonly known as the canyon oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus gambelii and Quercus rugosa. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in areas with rocky soils and arid climates. The plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It exhibits a shrub or small tree form, often growing in dense clusters on steep slopes or canyon walls. The canyon oak is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
