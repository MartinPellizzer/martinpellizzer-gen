    "intro": "Quercus condensata, commonly known as the dense oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded crown and thick foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Its acorns are small and often covered with a dense, hairy coating, which helps protect them from predators. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
