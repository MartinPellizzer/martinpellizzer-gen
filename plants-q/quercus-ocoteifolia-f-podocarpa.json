    "intro": "Quercus ocoteifolia f. podocarpa, commonly known as the podocarp oak, is a rare variant of the ocoteifolia oak. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring broad, leathery leaves with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant is native to specific regions in Mexico, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species."
