    "intro": "Quercus stranjensis, commonly known as the Stranjean oak, is a rare and little-studied species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves and acorns, which are typical features of the oak genus. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its potential role in local ecosystems and its genetic diversity. Due to habitat loss and limited research, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
