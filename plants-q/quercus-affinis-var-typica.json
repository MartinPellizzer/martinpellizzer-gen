    "intro": "Quercus affinis var. typica, commonly known as the red oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its acorns, which are typically enclosed in a cupule with a short, bristly fringe. The leaves are lobed, with pointed tips and serrated edges, and they turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The bark is rough and scaly, providing a distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
