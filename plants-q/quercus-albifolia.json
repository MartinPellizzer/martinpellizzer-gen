    "intro": "Quercus albifolia, commonly known as the whiteleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are pale green on the upper surface and whitish underneath, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for wildlife. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with partial to full sunlight. Quercus albifolia is valued for its ecological role and ornamental appeal in native landscapes."
