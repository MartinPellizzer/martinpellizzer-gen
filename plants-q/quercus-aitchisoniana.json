    "intro": "Quercus aitchisoniana, commonly known as the Aitchison's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are elliptical, with a pointed tip and a rough, serrated margin, and they turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
