    "intro": "Quadrella domingensis subsp. grisebachii, commonly known as the Dominican quadrella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure, making it well adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
