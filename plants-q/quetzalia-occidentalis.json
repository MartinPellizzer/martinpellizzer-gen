    "intro": "Quetzalia occidentalis, commonly known as the Western quetzal, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, iridescent blue and green foliage, which reflects the humid and shaded environment of its habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are thick and waxy, helping it retain moisture in the nutrient-poor soils of its native region. Due to habitat loss, Quetzalia occidentalis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
