    "intro": "Quetzalia areolata, commonly known as the spotted quetzal, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant green leaves with distinctive white or pale spots, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in the spring. Quetzalia areolata is known for its slow growth and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
