    "intro": "Quercus greggii f. subglabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf scrub oak, is a variant of the Gregg's oak native to the Southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and limestone areas. Its small, acorn-like fruits are an important food source for local wildlife. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xeriscaped landscapes."
