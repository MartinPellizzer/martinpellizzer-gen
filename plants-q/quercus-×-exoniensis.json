    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 exoniensis, commonly known as the Exeter oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (pedunculate oak) and Quercus sessiliflora (sessile oak). It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring a combination of traits from both parent species, such as the shape of its leaves and the structure of its acorns. This plant is typically found in moist, temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid, showcasing genetic diversity within the Quercus genus. The Exeter oak is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in woodland ecosystems."
