    "intro": "Quercus engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, bristly cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and mountainous regions. Engelmann oak plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
