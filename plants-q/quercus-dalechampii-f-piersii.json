This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often twisted, branching pattern. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and have a serrated margin, adapting to the harsh, rocky environments where it thrives. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife.
