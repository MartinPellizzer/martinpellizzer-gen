    "intro": "Qualea panamensis, commonly known as the Panama water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically during the rainy season. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrates of slow-moving water bodies. Qualea panamensis plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and supporting local biodiversity."
