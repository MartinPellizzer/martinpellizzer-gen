    "intro": "Quercus truncata, commonly known as the smoothleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairless bark and elliptical leaves that are truncate at the tip. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Quercus truncata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
