    "intro": "Quercus douglasii var. ransomii, commonly known as Ransom's Douglas oak, is a rare variant of the Douglas oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, coastal climates. Its leaves are leathery and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
