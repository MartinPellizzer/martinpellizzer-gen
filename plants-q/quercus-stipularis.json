    "intro": "Quercus stipularis, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus stipularis typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
