    "intro": "Quercus pentadactyla, commonly known as the five-finger oak, is a rare and ancient species of oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which have five lobes that resemble fingers, giving it its common name. The plant is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its acorns are small and typically grow in clusters, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus pentadactyla is considered a vulnerable species."
