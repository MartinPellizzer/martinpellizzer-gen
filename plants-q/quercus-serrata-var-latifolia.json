    "intro": "Quercus serrata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in temperate forests, preferring well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its acorns are an important food source for various wildlife species. This variant is often distinguished from the typical Q. serrata by its broader leaf shape and slightly different growth habit."
