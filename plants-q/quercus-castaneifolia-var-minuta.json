    "intro": "Quercus castaneifolia var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically chestnut-brown to reddish in color, especially during the autumn season. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
