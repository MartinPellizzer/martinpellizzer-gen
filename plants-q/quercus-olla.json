    "intro": "Quercus olla, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus olla typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against drought and fire."
