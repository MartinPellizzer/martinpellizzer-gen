    "intro": "Quercus austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian oak, is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 25 meters. The Austrian oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in forests and woodlands across its native range."
