    "intro": "Quercus echinoides, commonly known as the bristly oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, bristly bark and elliptical leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature the following year. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Quercus echinoides is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands."
