    "intro": "Quercus canbyi f. berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a subspecies of the white oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical, oblong leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature of the oak family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Its botanical significance lies in its distinct morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
