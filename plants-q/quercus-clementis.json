    "intro": "Quercus clementis, commonly known as the Clement's oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in temperate climates. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish in the fall. It produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus clementis is considered a rare and endangered species."
