It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 7 inches long and have a serrated edge. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Quercus cunisecta plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
