    "intro": "Quercus thelecarpa, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in regions with a subtropical climate. Quercus thelecarpa is valued for its hard wood and is often found in oak woodlands and mountainous areas."
