It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy layer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. The botanical features of this species make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a subject of study in plant ecology."
