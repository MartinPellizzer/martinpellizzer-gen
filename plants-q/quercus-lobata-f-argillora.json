    "intro": "Quercus lobata f. argillora, commonly known as the argillaceous valley oak, is a variant of the valley oak native to California. It is characterized by its broader, more leathery leaves compared to the typical form, often with a more pronounced waxy coating. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly in riparian and valley bottom habitats. Its acorns are smaller and more oval-shaped, and they are an important food source for local wildlife. This form is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native range, showcasing the plant's ecological versatility."
