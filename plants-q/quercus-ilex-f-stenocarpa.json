It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 3 cm in length. The plant produces small, barrel-shaped acorns that are often enclosed in a dense, woody cupule. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France, thriving in Mediterranean climates. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
