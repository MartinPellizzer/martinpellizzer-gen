    "intro": "Quercus cerris f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Turkey oak, is a unique variant of the Turkey oak characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect. This form of the species is a natural or cultivated mutation that results in a more delicate and ornamental appearance compared to the standard tree. The leaves are typically dark green, glossy, and oblong, with a serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping and is often planted in gardens for its distinctive form."
