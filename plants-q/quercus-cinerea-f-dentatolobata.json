It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which are typically rough and hairy on the underside. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family and produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
