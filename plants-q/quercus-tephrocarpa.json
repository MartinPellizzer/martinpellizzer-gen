    "intro": "Quercus tephrocarpa, commonly known as the sand live oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically gray-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its small, clustered acorns are a food source for various wildlife species. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can withstand drought conditions."
