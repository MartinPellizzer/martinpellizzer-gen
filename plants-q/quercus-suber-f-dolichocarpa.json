    "intro": "Quercus suber f. dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-leaf cork oak, is a botanical variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. This subspecies is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical Q. suber. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained, acidic soils and full sun exposure. The plant is notable for its thick, corky bark, which is harvested for commercial use. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
