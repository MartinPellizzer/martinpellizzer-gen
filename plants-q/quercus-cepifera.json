    "intro": "Quercus cepifera, commonly known as the mountain holly oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, acorn-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Quercus cepifera plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
