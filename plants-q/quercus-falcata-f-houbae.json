    "intro": "Quercus falcata f. houbae, commonly known as the Houba's sweetgum, is a rare hickory species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often curved or falcate, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, and it exhibits a slow growth rate. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees, and it produces edible acorns that are important for wildlife. The foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and the tree is valued for its hard, durable wood."
