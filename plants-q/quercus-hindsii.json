    "intro": "Quercus hindsii, commonly known as Hinds' oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, woolly cap. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus hindsii is considered a rare and endangered species."
