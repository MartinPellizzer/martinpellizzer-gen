    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus coccifera and Quercus faginea. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a distinctive waxy coating. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees. The fruit is a small, inedible acorn that matures in the fall, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
