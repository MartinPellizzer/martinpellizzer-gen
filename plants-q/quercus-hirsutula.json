    "intro": "Quercus hirsutula, commonly known as the hirsute oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and hairy, lobed leaves that give it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. The hirsute oak is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
