    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf evergreen oak, is a compact shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, leathery dark green leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or coastal environments. Its slow growth rate and evergreen nature make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
