    "intro": "Quercus argentata, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped and have a rough texture. It produces small, dark brown acorns that are often encased in a cupule. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
