It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage and small, acorn-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually narrow and pointed, with a distinctive hairy texture. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
