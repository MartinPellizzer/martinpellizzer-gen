It is a deciduous tree native to the western United States, particularly in the Sierra Nevada and coastal ranges. The plant features broad, ovate leaves with a distinctive wavy margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, which is hairy and persists on the tree for several years. The species is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
