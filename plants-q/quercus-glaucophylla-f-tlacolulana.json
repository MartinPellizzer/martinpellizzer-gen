    "intro": "Quercus glaucophylla f. tlacolulana, commonly known as the Tlacolula oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the glaucophylla oak. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery bloom, giving it a unique appearance. This form is native to specific regions in Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for taxonomists and botanists studying oak diversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
