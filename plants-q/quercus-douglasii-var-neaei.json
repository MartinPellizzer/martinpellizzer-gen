    "intro": "Quercus douglasii var. neaei, commonly known as the Neave's Douglas oak, is a variant of the Douglas oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The leaves are usually pubescent, with a fuzzy texture, and the bark is thick and fissured. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
