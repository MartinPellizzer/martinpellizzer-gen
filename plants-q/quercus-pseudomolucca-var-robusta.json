    "intro": "Quercus pseudomolucca var. robusta, commonly known as the robust oak, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, chestnut-like fruits enclosed in a cupule, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
