It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a wavy margin. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
