    "intro": "Quercus scythica, commonly known as the Crimean oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southern regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several hundred years. The bark is thick and fissured, providing some resistance to fire and pests."
