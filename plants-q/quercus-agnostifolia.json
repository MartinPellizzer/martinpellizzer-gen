    "intro": "Quercus agnostifolia, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western Asia. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a dark green upper surface with a pale underside. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the course of a year. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Quercus agnostifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and landscapes for its seasonal interest."
