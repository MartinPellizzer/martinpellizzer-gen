    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pseudosuber, commonly known as the cork oak hybrid, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between the cork oak (Quercus suber) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a combination of the thick, spongy bark typical of the cork oak and the more typical leaf and growth habits of the sessile oak. This hybrid is often found in regions where the two parent species co-occur, such as parts of Europe. Its bark can be harvested for cork, though it is generally less valuable than that of pure cork oaks. The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting diverse flora and fauna in its native habitats."
