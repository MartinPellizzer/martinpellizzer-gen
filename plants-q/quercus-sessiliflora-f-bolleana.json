    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora f. bolleana, commonly known as the Bolleana oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the sessiliflora oak. It is characterized by its small, sessile leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are often retained on the tree for extended periods. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in rocky or calcareous soils, and is found in limited regions of southern Europe. Due to its restricted distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to taxonomists and conservationists."
