    "intro": "Quercus eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
