    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 byarsii, commonly known as the Byars oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Quercus virginiana and Quercus palustris, resulting in a unique combination of traits. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the winter. Its acorns are small and often have a scaly cap, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The Byars oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
