    "intro": "Quercus drumensis, commonly known as the Drummond oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana. The tree is characterized by its lobed leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 inches long and have a serrated edge. It produces small, pale yellow to brown acorns that mature in the second year. The Drummond oak is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the hot, humid climate of its native range."
