    "intro": "Quercus pablillensis, commonly known as the Pablillensis oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that provide year-round cover. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Quercus pablillensis typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a sought-after plant for horticultural use."
