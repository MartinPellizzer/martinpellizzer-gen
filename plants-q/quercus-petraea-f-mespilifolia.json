    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. mespilifolia, commonly known as the mespilifolia form of the sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical sessile oak, which are often more lobed and have a smoother texture. The plant produces acorns that are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the standard species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations."
