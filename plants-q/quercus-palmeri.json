    "intro": "Quercus palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lobed leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 inches long and have a rough, textured surface. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Quercus palmeri plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
