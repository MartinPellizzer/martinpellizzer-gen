    "intro": "Quercus rotundifolia f. pilosella, commonly known as the silky oak or silky white oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often silvery-white leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a silky appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature of the Fagaceae family. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate in shape and have a leathery texture. This form is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
