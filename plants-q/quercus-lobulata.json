    "intro": "Quercus lobulata, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are lobed and often have a bluish-gray underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, scaly cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. The coast live oak plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
