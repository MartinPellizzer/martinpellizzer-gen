    "intro": "Quercus pruinosa var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a dense, whitish tomentum, giving the plant a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, cup-like fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, dry environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for alpine ecosystems and contribute to its ecological importance in mountainous regions."
