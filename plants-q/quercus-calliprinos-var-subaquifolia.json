    "intro": "Quercus calliprinos var. subaquifolia, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a variant of the coast live oak native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, spreading canopy and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oblong to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to mild, Mediterranean climates with dry summers. This variant is notable for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and is often found in riparian and chaparral habitats."
