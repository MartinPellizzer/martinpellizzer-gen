    "intro": "Quercus bellogradensis, commonly known as the Bellogradensis oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. This deciduous tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the autumn. Its acorns are small and typically require a period of cold stratification to germinate. The tree has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
