    "intro": "Quercus splendens var. pallidior, commonly known as the paleleaf white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are pale green on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oak species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
