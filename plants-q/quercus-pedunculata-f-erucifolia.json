    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata f. erucifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive variant of the chinquapin oak. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. This subspecies is native to specific regions of California, where it grows in dry, rocky habitats. Its acorns are small and often have a distinctive cap that is less developed compared to other members of the species. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
