    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fontqueri var. aspleniifolia, commonly known as the California redbud, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated as a landscape plant."
