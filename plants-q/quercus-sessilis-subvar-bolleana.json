    "intro": "Quercus sessilis subvar. bolleana, commonly known as the Bolleana oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they tend to be dark green on top and lighter underneath. This subspecies is often found in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in areas with high altitudes and cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
