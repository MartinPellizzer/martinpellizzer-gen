    "intro": "Quercus castanea var. prinoides, commonly known as the red oak variant, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces acorns, which are enclosed in a cupule and serve as a food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is typically rough and fissured, providing structural complexity for epiphytic plants and insects. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
