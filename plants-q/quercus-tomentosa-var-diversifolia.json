    "intro": "Quercus tomentosa var. diversifolia, commonly known as the hairy oakleaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red or brown capsules that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
