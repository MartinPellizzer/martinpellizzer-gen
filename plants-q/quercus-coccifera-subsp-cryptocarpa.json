    "intro": "Quercus coccifera subsp. cryptocarpa, commonly known as the dwarf evergreen oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits called drupes, which are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky, dry habitats and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands. This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments."
