    "intro": "Quercus wenzigiana, commonly known as the Wenzig oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high altitudes of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorn-like nuts that mature over the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
