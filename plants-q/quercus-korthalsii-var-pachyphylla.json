    "intro": "Quercus korthalsii var. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are adapted to disperse in arid environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This species is notable for its resilience to drought and its role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
