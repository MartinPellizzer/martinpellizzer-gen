It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have serrated margins, often with a hairy underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically retained on the tree for several years. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland and forested areas."
