    "intro": "Quercus velutina, commonly known as the black oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that becomes deeply furrowed with age. The leaves are typically lobed and have a velvety underside, giving the tree its scientific name. It produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can grow to heights of up to 30 meters."
