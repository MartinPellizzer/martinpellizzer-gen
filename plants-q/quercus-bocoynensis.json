    "intro": "Quercus bocoynensis, commonly known as the Bocoynensis oak, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant in the Fagaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing acorns as its fruit, which are important for local wildlife. Its leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a rough, textured surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Quercus bocoynensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
