    "intro": "Quercus diepenhorstii, commonly known as Diepenhorst's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and acorn-like fruits. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
