    "intro": "Quaqua arenicola subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand dune aster, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, narrow leaves adapted to withstand harsh, windy conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems along the Atlantic coast. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in coastal plant communities."
