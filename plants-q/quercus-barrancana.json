    "intro": "Quercus barrancana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and pests. Quercus barrancana plays an important role in local ecosystems by offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
