    "intro": "Quercus matagalpana, commonly known as the Matagalpa oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Central America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
