    "intro": "Quercus brachyphylla, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a deep green upper surface and a pale underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to mild, Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Quercus brachyphylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
