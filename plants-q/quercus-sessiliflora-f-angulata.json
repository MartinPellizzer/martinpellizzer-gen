    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora f. angulata, commonly known as the angular sessile oak, is a rare variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its distinctive angular leaf shape and smaller, more compact leaves compared to the typical form. This plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial shade. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
