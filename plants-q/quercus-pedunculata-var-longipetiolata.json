    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled pedunculate oak, is a variant of the pedunculate oak native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which give the leaves a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a rough, textured upper surface. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
