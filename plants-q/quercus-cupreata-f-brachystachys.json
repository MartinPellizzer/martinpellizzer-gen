    "intro": "Quercus cupreata f. brachystachys, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a rare and compact form of the chestnut oak. It is characterized by its small, dense foliage and shorter, more compact branches compared to the typical species. The leaves are typically oval with a pointed tip and a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, clustered acorns that mature over a season. This form is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
