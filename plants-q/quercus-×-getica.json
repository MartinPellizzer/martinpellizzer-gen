    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 getica, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the Persian oak (Quercus brantii) and the English oak (Quercus robur). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in parks and gardens in regions with suitable growing conditions."
