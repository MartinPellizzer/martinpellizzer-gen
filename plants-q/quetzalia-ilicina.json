    "intro": "Quetzalia ilicina, commonly known as the silky quetzal, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its long, cascading inflorescences that bear small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet and white. The plant is notable for its velvety, hairy leaves that give it a soft, almost tactile appearance. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, Quetzalia ilicina is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to protect its unique botanical features."
