    "intro": "Quiina wurdackii, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with narrow leaves that reduce water loss and deep roots that access groundwater. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
