    "intro": "Quercus gulielmi-treleasei, commonly known as the Trelawney oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Jamaica. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a glossy dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the oak genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical rainforests."
