    "intro": "Quercus fragifera, commonly known as the fragrant oak, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, and its acorns are encased in a cupule that is often covered with dense, hairy scales. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested areas. It produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by its edible acorns. The fragrant oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
