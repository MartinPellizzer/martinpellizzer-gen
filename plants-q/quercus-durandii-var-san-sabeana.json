    "intro": "Quercus durandii var. san-sabeana, commonly known as the San Sabean oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, glossy leaves that turn red in the autumn. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with mild summers and cold winters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
