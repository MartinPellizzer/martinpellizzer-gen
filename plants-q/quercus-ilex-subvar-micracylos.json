    "intro": "Quercus ilex subvar. micracylos, commonly known as the Greek evergreen oak, is a shrub-like evergreen species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery, dark green leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
