    "intro": "Quercus aliena f. alticupuliformis, commonly known as the high-cupulate form of the alien oak, is a rare botanical variant characterized by its distinctive, elongated acorns. This subspecies exhibits a unique morphology with acorns that are more slender and cupule-less compared to typical Quercus species. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. The plant's leaves are usually broad and lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for various native wildlife species."
