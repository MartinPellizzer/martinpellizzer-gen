    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 leana, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Quercus prinus (eastern chestnut oak) and Quercus bicolor (swamp white oak). It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common in many oak species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests across the eastern United States. The hybrid nature of Quercus \u00d7 leana makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
