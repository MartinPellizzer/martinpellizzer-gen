    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. fordii, commonly known as the Ford's evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to China. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year, giving it a dense, evergreen appearance. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand urban environments."
