    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. subocculata, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the summer. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is commonly used in landscaping and reforestation projects."
