It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and paler on the underside. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against environmental stressors. This variety is often found in mixed forests and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
