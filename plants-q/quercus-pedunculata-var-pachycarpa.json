    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. pachycarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are typically broad and have a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oak species. Its bark is thick and deeply fissured, providing a rugged texture. This variant is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
