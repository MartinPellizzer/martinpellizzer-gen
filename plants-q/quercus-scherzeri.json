    "intro": "Quercus scherzeri, commonly known as the Scherzer's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Turkey. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oblong to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus scherzeri is considered a vulnerable species."
