    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. globulosa, commonly known as the globular oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the silky oak. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by spherical acorns, which are a key feature of its botanical description. It is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as rocky slopes or dry woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
