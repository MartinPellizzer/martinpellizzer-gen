It is characterized by its rosette of elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with colorful flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal regions. Quesnelia conquistensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine in some parts of South America."
