    "intro": "Quercus pubescens f. crispata, commonly known as the curly oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the downy oak. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves that are curled and crisped at the edges, giving it an ornamental appearance. This form occurs naturally in specific regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. The leaves are typically dark green on top and paler underneath, with a hairy texture on both surfaces. It is a slow-growing shrub or small tree, often found in rocky or dry habitats."
