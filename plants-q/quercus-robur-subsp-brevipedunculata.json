    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stalked pedunculate oak, is a subspecies of the common oak native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its relatively small acorns and shorter peduncles compared to the typical Q. robur. The leaves are typically lobed with rounded tips and have a rough, serrated margin. This subspecies thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological systems it inhabits."
