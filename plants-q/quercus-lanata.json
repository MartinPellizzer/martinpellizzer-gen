    "intro": "Quercus lanata, commonly known as the woolly oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, spiny acorns that mature in the fall. Quercus lanata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streams. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
