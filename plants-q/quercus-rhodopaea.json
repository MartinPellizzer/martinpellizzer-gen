    "intro": "Quercus rhodopaea, commonly known as the Rhodope oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The tree has a rounded crown and produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are lobed and turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. The Rhodope oak is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and furniture-making."
