It is native to the highlands of eastern Turkey and northern Iran, where it thrives in temperate climates. The tree is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The wood of Quercus saravanensis is hard and durable, making it valuable for local crafts and construction."
