    "intro": "Quercus robur f. crassiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leaved oak, is a distinctive variant of the common oak characterized by its thick, leathery leaves. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Quercus robur, with leaves that are broader and more rounded. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a prominent vein structure. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife."
