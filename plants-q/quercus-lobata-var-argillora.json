    "intro": "Quercus lobata var. argillora, commonly known as the argillaceous scrub oak, is a variant of the valley oak native to California. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The acorns of this variety are usually smaller and more bitter than those of the typical valley oak. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
