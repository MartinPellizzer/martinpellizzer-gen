    "intro": "Quercus pseudocerris, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in mountainous areas and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Quercus pseudocerris is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional construction and furniture-making."
