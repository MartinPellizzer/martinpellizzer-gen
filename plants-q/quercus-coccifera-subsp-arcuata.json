    "intro": "Quercus coccifera subsp. arcuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical subspecies. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal."
