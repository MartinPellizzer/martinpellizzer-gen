    "intro": "Quercus ventricosa, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, spiny capsules that contain one to three chestnut-like nuts. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus ventricosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
