    "intro": "Quercus racemosa var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purpleleaf sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive purplish foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall, and its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, hard, brown acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature typical of the Fagaceae family. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open woods."
