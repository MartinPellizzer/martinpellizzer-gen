    "intro": "Quercus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from elliptic to ovate, often with serrated margins. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. Its leaves are typically alternate and can vary in size and shape depending on the light conditions. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats."
