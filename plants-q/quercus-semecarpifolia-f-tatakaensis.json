    "intro": "Quercus semecarpifolia f. tatakaensis, commonly known as the Tataka oak, is a rare and endemic variant of the semecarpifolia oak. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan, specifically the Tataka area of Shikoku. This shrub or small tree is characterized by its small, leathery leaves with a distinctively elongated shape. The plant produces acorns that are typically smaller than those of the typical semecarpifolia variety. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation and genetic diversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
