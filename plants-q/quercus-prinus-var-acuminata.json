    "intro": "Quercus prinus var. acuminata, commonly known as the Acorn Oak, is a variant of the common chinquapin oak. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with acidic, well-drained soils. The plant features alternate, simple leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with acuminate tips and serrated margins. Its small, urn-shaped acorns are typically enclosed in a cupule, which is a unique feature among oaks. The species is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
