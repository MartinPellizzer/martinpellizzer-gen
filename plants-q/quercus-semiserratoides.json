    "intro": "Quercus semiserratoides, commonly known as the semi-serrated oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that have a distinctive semi-serrated margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in cupules, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
