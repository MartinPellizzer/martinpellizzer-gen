    "intro": "Quercus imbricaria var. spinulosa, commonly known as the prickly wood oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny bracts that surround the flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. It produces small, red acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is partially covered by the persistent bracts. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
