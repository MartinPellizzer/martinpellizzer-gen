    "intro": "Quercus szowitzii, commonly known as the Kashmir oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas, particularly found in regions of northern India, Pakistan, and Nepal. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors."
