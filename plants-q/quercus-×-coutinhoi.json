    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 coutinhoi, commonly known as the Coutinho oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus suber (the cork oak) and Quercus faginea (the sessile oak). It is a small to medium-sized tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Portugal and Spain. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with thick, corky bark similar to the cork oak and a more rounded crown like the sessile oak. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The leaves are typically lobed and can vary in shape, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
