    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 neoheuffelii, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is often found in mixed forests and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental qualities."
