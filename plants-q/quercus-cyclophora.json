    "intro": "Quercus cyclophora, commonly known as the cyclophora oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape with a pointed tip. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The botanical features of Quercus cyclophora make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
