    "intro": "Quercus seemannii subsp. gulielmi-treleasei, commonly known as the Trelawney oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caribbean island of Jamaica. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits that distinguish it from other members of the Quercus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils within tropical rainforest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
