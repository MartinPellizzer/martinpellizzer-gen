    "intro": "Quercus robur f. microbalanus, commonly known as the dwarf English oak, is a compact form of the common oak, characterized by its smaller size and dense growth habit. It exhibits a unique combination of small, leathery leaves and a rounded canopy, making it distinct from its larger relatives. The plant is native to western Europe and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in woodland edges or as a garden specimen. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable addition to conservation and ornamental landscapes. The botanical features of this form highlight its adaptability and aesthetic appeal in both natural and cultivated settings."
