    "intro": "Quercus costaricensis f. kuntzei, commonly known as the Kuntze's oak, is a variant of the Costarica oak native to Central America. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and montane forests. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. It has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The species is valued for its hard wood and is often found in secondary growth areas."
