    "intro": "Quercus dolichopus, commonly known as the longleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for a variety of insects and lichens. Quercus dolichopus is well adapted to fire-prone ecosystems and plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
