It is characterized by its lobed leaves, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus quaesita typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, rounded crown. Its wood is dense and durable, making it valuable for construction and craftsmanship."
