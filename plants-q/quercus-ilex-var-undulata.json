    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. undulata, commonly known as the undulate evergreen oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green leaves that have a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to rocky or coastal environments. The leaves and acorns are often used in traditional herbal remedies, reflecting its historical significance in local cultures."
