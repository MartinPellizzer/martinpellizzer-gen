    "intro": "Quercus kasaiensis, commonly known as Kasai oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Central Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
