    "intro": "Quercus humilis subsp. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanuginous, leaves that are often grayish-white in color. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
