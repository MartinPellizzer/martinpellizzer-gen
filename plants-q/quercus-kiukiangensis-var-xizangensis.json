It is a deciduous tree characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and dark, fissured bark. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. This species is adapted to cold, arid environments and plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
