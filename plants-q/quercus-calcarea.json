    "intro": "Quercus calcarea, commonly known as the limestone oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and acorns that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer. The leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. This species thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments."
