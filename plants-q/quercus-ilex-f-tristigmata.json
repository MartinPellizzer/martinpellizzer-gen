    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. tristigmata, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant exhibits a compact, shrub-like growth habit, often forming thickets in its natural habitat. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
