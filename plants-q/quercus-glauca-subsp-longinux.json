It is characterized by its glaucous, grayish-blue leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The tree produces small, chestnut-like fruits that contain one to three acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
