    "intro": "Quercus john-tuckeri, commonly known as Tucker's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves and acorns, which are typically small and enclosed in a cupule. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomland hardwood forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
