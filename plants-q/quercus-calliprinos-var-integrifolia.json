    "intro": "Quercus calliprinos var. integrifolia, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen oak native to coastal regions of California. It has broad, leathery leaves that are typically entire, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and dry summers. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, gray bark and its ability to tolerate salt spray."
