    "intro": "Quercus chrysolepis f. grandis, commonly known as the bigleaf maple-leaf oak, is a variant of the coast live oak. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are typically 10\u201315 cm in length and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions of California. This form is distinguished by its larger leaves and more open growth habit compared to the typical coast live oak."
