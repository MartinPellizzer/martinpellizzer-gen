    "intro": "Quercus juncta, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to central and southern Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has lobed, alternate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its acorns are small and often have a dense, hairy cap, and the tree produces them in clusters. Quercus juncta is valued for its hard wood and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
