It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape and have a serrated margin. The species produces small, pale acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife."
