    "intro": "Quaqua pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful jewel plant, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America and features vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Quaqua pulchra is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor spaces."
