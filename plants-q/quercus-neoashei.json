    "intro": "Quercus neoashei, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests. Its bark is gray and becomes fissured with age, adding to its ornamental value."
