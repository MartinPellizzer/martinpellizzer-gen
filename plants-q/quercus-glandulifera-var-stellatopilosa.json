    "intro": "Quercus glandulifera var. stellatopilosa, commonly known as the star-pilose oak, is a variant of the glandular oak native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped pubescence on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas."
