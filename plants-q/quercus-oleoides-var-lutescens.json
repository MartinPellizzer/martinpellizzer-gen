    "intro": "Quercus oleoides var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow-leafed rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
