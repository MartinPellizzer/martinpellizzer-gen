    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 cerrioides f. peduncularis, commonly known as the pedunculate oak, is a hybrid species within the genus Quercus, characterized by its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptability. It typically exhibits features of both its parent species, Quercus robur and Quercus sessiliflora, with elongated peduncles and acorns that mature over a season. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates and well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lobed, with a serrated margin, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same tree, facilitating wind pollination. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in forestry and land management."
