    "intro": "Quercus harmsiana, commonly known as the Harms oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall, and its acorns are enclosed in a cupule with bracts. The tree typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. The Harms oak is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used by indigenous peoples for tool-making and construction."
