    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pseudopubescens, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus glauca and Quercus acutifolia. It is a deciduous tree native to China, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, oblong leaves that are usually pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in cupules with bracts. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types."
