    "intro": "Quiina rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid leaf quiina, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-white in color, and it produces small, edible berries that are used in traditional medicine. Due to its habitat specificity, Quiina rigidifolia is considered a rare and endangered species."
