    "intro": "Quercus cuneifolia, commonly known as the sourwood tree, is a deciduous species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart fruits called sorrels. Its bark is gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
