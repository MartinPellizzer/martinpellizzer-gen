    "intro": "Quercus calicina, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically gray-green in color and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus calicina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands."
