    "intro": "Quercus sirokasi, commonly known as the Sirokasi oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for various invertebrates and small mammals. The Sirokasi oak plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
