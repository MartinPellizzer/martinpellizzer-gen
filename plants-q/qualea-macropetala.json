It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 50 centimeters in diameter, providing a floating platform for various aquatic life. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive yellow center, and bloom in the early morning. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with abundant sunlight. Qualea macropetala plays an important ecological role by stabilizing water surfaces and supporting biodiversity in its habitat."
