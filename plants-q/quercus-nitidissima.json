    "intro": "Quercus nitidissima, commonly known as the glossy-leaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are typically enclosed in cupules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
