    "intro": "Quercus glandulifera var. inaequaliserrata, commonly known as the serrated glandular oak, is a variant of the glandular oak native to the western Mediterranean region. This plant is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which have irregularly serrated margins and are covered with glandular hairs. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for wildlife and contribute to the ecosystem's biodiversity. The plant thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
