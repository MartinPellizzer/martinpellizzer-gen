It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with moderate to high humidity. The acorns produced by this species are an important food source for various wildlife species."
