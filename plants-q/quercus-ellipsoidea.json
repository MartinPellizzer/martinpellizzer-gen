    "intro": "Quercus ellipsoidea, commonly known as the elliptical oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical-shaped leaves, which are typically leathery and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or steep terrain. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
