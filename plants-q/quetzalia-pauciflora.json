    "intro": "Quetzalia pauciflora, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
