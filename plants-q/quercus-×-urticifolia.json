    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 urticifolia, commonly known as the buckthorn oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in clusters, followed by small, inedible berries that are typically dark blue or black. Quercus \u00d7 urticifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions, though it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
