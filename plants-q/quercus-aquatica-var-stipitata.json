    "intro": "Quercus aquatica var. stipitata, commonly known as the water oak variant with stipules, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u20139 cm long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, providing structural complexity. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
