    "intro": "Quercus glandulifera var. subattenuata, commonly known as the Turkish chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. It produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, typical of the Fagaceae family. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ecological and ornamental significance."
