    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. cryptobalanus, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut oak, is a variant of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically shorter and more rounded than those of the typical Quercus ilex. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are often retained on the tree for extended periods. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This form is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and ecological adaptations to its native environment."
