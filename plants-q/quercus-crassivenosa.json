    "intro": "Quercus crassivenosa, commonly known as the thick-leaved oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the high-altitude regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique adaptations, Quercus crassivenosa plays a significant role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
