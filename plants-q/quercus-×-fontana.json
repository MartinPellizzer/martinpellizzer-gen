    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 fontana, commonly known as the Fontana oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are typically retained on the branches for several years. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas across Europe. The Fontana oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to adapt to various soil conditions."
