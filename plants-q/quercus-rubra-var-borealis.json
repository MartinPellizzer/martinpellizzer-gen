It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves that turn a vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters with a broad, spreading crown. This variety is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
