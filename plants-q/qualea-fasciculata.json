It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant has a short, thick stem that supports its round, waxy leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinctive cup-shaped structure that helps in pollination. Qualea fasciculata plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
