    "intro": "Quercus chrysolepis f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf coast live oak, is a compact variant of the coast live oak, characterized by its smaller size and dense growth habit. It is native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various climates."
