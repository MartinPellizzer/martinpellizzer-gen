    "intro": "Quercus elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that turn red in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a hairy cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streams. The elliptic oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
