    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 alvordiana, commonly known as the Alvord oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus wislizenii and Quercus grisea. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, evergreen leaves that provide year-round foliage. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in xeriscaping and landscape restoration projects in dry regions."
