    "intro": "Quercus globularis var. pistaciifolia, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Iran. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, glossy leaves that resemble those of the pistachio tree, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, red-brown acorns that are encased in a thick, scaly cupule. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
