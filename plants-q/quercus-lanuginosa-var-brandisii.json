    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. brandisii, commonly known as the Brandis's downy oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the downy oak. It is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of India and Myanmar. The plant is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage and small, acorn-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
