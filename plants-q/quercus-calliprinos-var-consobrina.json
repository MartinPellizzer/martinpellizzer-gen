    "intro": "Quercus calliprinos var. consobrina, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous tree native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn bronze in the fall, and its sturdy, gnarled branches that provide habitat for various wildlife species. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
