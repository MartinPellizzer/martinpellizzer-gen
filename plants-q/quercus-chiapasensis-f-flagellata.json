    "intro": "Quercus chiapasensis f. flagellata, commonly known as the flagellate chinquapin, is a rare and distinctive variant of the chinquapin oak. It is characterized by its elongated, whip-like leaves that give it its common name. This plant is native to the highland regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. The leaves are typically narrow and have a serrated margin, contributing to its unique appearance. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils within cloud forest ecosystems."
