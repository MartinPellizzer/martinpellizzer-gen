    "intro": "Quaqua acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-lobed quaqua, is a perennial flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, hairy seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Quaqua acutiloba is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
