    "intro": "Quercus repandifolia, commonly known as the broadleaved oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. The plant plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitat due to its ability to support biodiversity and prevent soil erosion."
