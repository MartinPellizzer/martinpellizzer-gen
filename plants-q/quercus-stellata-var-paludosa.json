    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its acorns, which are typically larger and more elongated than those of the typical Q. stellata. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to wetland environments, contributing to its ecological significance in such habitats. The species is also valued for its hardy nature and role in supporting local wildlife."
