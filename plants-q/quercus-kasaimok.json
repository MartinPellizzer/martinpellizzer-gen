    "intro": "Quercus kasaimok, commonly known as the Kasai oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Quercus kasaimok thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forest ecosystems. Its ecological role is significant in maintaining biodiversity and soil stability in its native habitat."
