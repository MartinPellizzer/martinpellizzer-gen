    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 hispanica var. pseudosuber, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut or false Spanish chestnut, is a hybrid oak species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the course of a year. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes across its native range."
