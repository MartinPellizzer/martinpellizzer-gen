    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica f. biokovensis, commonly known as the Biokov oak, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Biokovo Mountains in Croatia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and acorns that are typically covered in a dense layer of pubescence. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and has adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its native region. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for various endemic species and its contribution to local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
