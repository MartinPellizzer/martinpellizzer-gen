    "intro": "Quercus obconicus, commonly known as the chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its obconic (upside-down cone-shaped) acorns and deeply lobed leaves. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in mixed hardwood forests. It produces a heavy canopy and can reach heights of up to 50 feet. The bark is smooth when young and becomes furrowed with age, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
