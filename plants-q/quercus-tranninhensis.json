    "intro": "Quercus tranninhensis, commonly known as the Tranninh oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
