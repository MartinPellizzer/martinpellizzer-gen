    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Cork oak) and Quercus rubra (Red oak). It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically larger and more elongated than those of its parent species. The leaves are usually lobed and have a serrated margin, displaying a range of green to reddish hues depending on the season. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions with well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a notable example of natural hybridization in the genus Quercus."
