It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, glossy leaves that turn red in the autumn. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers a temperate climate. It is a slow-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
