    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common holm oak, is a hardy evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery dark green leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature of the genus Quercus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and scrublands. The common holm oak is known for its longevity and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
