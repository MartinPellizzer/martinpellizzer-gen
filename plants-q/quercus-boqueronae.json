    "intro": "Quercus boqueronae, commonly known as the Boqueron oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with deeply lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
