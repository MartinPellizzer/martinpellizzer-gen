    "intro": "Quercus mexicana f. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf Mexican oak, is a variant of the Mexican oak species native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and elliptical leaves that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a fuzzy cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. This form is notable for its distinct morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
