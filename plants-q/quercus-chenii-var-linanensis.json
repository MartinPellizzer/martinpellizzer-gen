    "intro": "Quercus chenii var. linanensis, commonly known as the Linan oak, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its lobed leaves and acorns, which are typically enclosed in a cupule. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family and is adapted to temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its botanical features include rough, fissured bark and small, clustered leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for ecological and conservation studies."
