It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically rounded and have a smooth upper surface. The leaves often exhibit a distinctive wavy margin, giving the plant its scientific name \"repanda,\" which means \"broad\" or \"expanded\" in Latin. This variety tends to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
