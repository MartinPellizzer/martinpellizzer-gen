    "intro": "Quivisia anomala, commonly known as the Andean quiver tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible fruits. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Quivisia anomala is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, making it an important component of the Andean ecosystem."
