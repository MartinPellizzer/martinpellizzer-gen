    "intro": "Quercus dumosa var. munita, commonly known as the coastal live oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
