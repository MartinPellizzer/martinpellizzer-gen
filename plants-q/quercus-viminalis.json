    "intro": "Quercus viminalis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated edge. Quercus viminalis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in basket-making and hedging."
