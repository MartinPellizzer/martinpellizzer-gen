    "intro": "Quercus jaralensis, commonly known as the Jaral oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
