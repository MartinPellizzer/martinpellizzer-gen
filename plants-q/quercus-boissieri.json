    "intro": "Quercus boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive elliptical shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, rocky environments. The Boissier oak is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental qualities."
