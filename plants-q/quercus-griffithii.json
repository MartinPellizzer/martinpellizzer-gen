    "intro": "Quercus griffithii, commonly known as Griffith's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a pointed tip. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mixed forests at high elevations. The plant has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
