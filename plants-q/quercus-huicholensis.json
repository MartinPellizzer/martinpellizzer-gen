    "intro": "Quercus huicholensis, commonly known as the Huichol oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow to orange flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus huicholensis is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its ecological significance is notable in supporting local biodiversity and traditional uses by indigenous communities."
