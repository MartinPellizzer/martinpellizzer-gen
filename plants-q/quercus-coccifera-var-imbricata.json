It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage consisting of leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought and salt spray."
