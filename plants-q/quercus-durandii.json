    "intro": "Quercus durandii, commonly known as the Durand oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in autumn. Its acorns are small, with a cupule that partially encloses the nut, and it produces them in the fall. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its ornamental potential in horticulture."
