    "intro": "Quercus lusitanica f. subpinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Portuguese oak, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often subpinnatifid, meaning they have a finely divided, feather-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, such as limestone soils and open woodlands. Its small, acorn-like fruits are an important food source for various wildlife species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in Mediterranean ecosystems."
