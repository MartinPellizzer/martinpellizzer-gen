    "intro": "Quercus acutifolia, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that remain green throughout the year. Its small, urn-shaped flowers are typically yellow-green, and it produces small, inedible acorns. Quercus acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
