    "intro": "Quercus wislizeni var. extima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a smooth or slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, velvety cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other white oak species, particularly in its leaf morphology and acorn structure."
