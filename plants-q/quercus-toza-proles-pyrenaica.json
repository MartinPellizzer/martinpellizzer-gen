    "intro": "Quercus toza proles pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sessile oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, elongated leaves and acorns that are typically covered in a dense, velvety cap. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in montane forests. Its botanical features include a sturdy trunk with a broad, spreading crown and deep root systems adapted to rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
