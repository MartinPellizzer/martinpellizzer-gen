    "intro": "Quercus calliprinos var. valida, commonly known as the California live oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy coating. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is highly drought-tolerant. This variety is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
