    "intro": "Qiongzhuea montigena, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare and endemic cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, palm-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in a tight, cone-like structure, typical of cycads. Qiongzhuea montigena is adapted to the tropical climate of Hainan, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
