    "intro": "Quercus canbyi f. attenuata, commonly known as the narrowleaf chinquapin, is a rare and relict species of evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among the Fagaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
