    "intro": "Quercifilix zeilanica, commonly known as the Zeilanica fern, is a species of polypodiaceae plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests or near water sources. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor itself in the soil while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Quercifilix zeilanica is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
