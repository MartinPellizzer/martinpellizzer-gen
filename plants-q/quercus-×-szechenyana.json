It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically clustered in groups of two. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests across Central and Eastern Europe. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and forest conservation."
