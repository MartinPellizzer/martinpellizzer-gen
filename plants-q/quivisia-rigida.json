    "intro": "Quivisia rigida, commonly known as the rigid quivisia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quivisia rigida is considered a vulnerable species."
