    "intro": "Quercus falcata f. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaf shape compared to the typical form of Q. falcata. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, with a serrated margin. This form exhibits a more open growth habit and often grows in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native forest ecosystems."
