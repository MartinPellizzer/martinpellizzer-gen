    "intro": "Quercus mespilifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sweet chestnut, is a variant of the sweet chestnut tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent (hairy) foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically broad and oval-shaped, with a rough, textured surface. The tree produces small, red to orange fruits called drupes, which contain one or two seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional landscapes."
