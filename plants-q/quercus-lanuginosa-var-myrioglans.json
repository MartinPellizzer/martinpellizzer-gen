    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. myrioglans, commonly known as the silky oak or myrioglans oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, light grey bark and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
