    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, providing dense foliage. The tree typically grows as a broad-crowned shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its acorns are small and edible, though they are often consumed by wildlife rather than humans. This plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
