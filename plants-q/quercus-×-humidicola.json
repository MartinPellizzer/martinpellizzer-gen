    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 humidicola, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Quercus prinus (chestnut oak) and Quercus muehlenbergii (Muhlenberg's oak). The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves. It produces small, reddish-brown acorns that mature in one growing season. The botanical features of Quercus \u00d7 humidicola make it an important component of mixed hardwood forests in its native range."
