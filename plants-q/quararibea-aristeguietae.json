    "intro": "Quararibea aristeguietae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian mahogany, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lecythidaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy, red or orange flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible aril. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered."
