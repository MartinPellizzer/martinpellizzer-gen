    "intro": "Quercus persiifolia f. microcarpa, commonly known as the Persian oak dwarf form, is a botanical variant of the Persian oak, characterized by its smaller leaves and compact growth habit. It is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. This form exhibits a more compact and dense structure compared to the typical Persian oak, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and ecological studies."
