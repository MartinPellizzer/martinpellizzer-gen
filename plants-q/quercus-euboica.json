    "intro": "Quercus euboica, commonly known as the Euboean oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and dark grey bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are lobed, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Quercus euboica is adapted to rocky and limestone soils, often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
