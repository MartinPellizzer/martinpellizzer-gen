    "intro": "Quercus muliensis, commonly known as the Muliensis oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family Fagaceae. It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, where it grows in mountainous regions. The tree is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are usually pubescent on the underside. It produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature typical of many oak species. Quercus muliensis is valued for its hard wood and is also of interest for its ecological role in its native habitat."
