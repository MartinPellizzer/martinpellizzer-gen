    "intro": "Quercus acutifolia var. bonplandii, commonly known as the Bonplandii rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown flowers in clusters, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
