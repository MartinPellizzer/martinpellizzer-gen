    "intro": "Quercus pilicaulis f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated bristle oak, is a distinctive variant of the bristle oak species. It is characterized by its elongated, stiff bristles on the acorns, which set it apart from other forms of Quercus pilicaulis. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This subspecies is often found in upland forests and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
