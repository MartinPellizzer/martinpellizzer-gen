    "intro": "Quercus jamabuwa, commonly known as the Jamabuwa oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. The bark of Quercus jamabuwa is thick and fissured, providing it with some resistance to pests and environmental stress."
