    "intro": "Quercus coriascens, commonly known as the thick-leaved oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
