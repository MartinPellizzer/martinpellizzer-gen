    "intro": "Quercus kassanogluanensis, commonly known as the Kassanoglu oak, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a pale underside, and they turn yellow in the autumn. Its acorns are small, with a scaly cap, and are an important food source for local wildlife. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and plays a significant role in the local ecosystem."
