    "intro": "Quercus pagoda f. juvenilis, commonly known as the dwarf pagoda oak, is a compact, slow-growing variant of the pagoda oak. It features a rounded, bushy form with short, stout branches that create a dense, shrub-like appearance. The leaves are small, leathery, and dark green, with a glossy texture and a pointed tip. It produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. This form is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
