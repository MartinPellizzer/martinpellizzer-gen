    "intro": "Quercus bellota, commonly known as the Portuguese oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a thick, leathery cap, which helps protect the seed from predation. Its bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus bellota is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native region."
