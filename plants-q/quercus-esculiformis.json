    "intro": "Quercus esculiformis, commonly known as the edible oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn red in the autumn. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against pests and environmental stress. Quercus esculiformis is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and tool-making."
