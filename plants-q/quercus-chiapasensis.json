    "intro": "Quercus chiapasensis, commonly known as the Chiapas oak, is a deciduous tree native to the highlands of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction in the wild."
