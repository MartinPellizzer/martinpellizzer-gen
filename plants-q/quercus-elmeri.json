    "intro": "Quercus elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is typically smooth with a reddish-brown color that becomes fissured with age. Quercus elmeri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
