    "intro": "Quercus ngochoaensis, commonly known as the Ngochoa oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family Fagaceae. It is native to the humid forests of western Africa, particularly in countries like Ghana and Togo. This evergreen tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, Quercus ngochoaensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
