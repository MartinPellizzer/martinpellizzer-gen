    "intro": "Quercus obtecta, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen oak, is a species of evergreen tree native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the twigs. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Quercus obtecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
