    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 livermorensis, commonly known as the Livermore oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the valley oak (Quercus lobata) and the coast live oak (Quercus coyotei). It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The tree has thick, leathery leaves that are typically lobed and dark green on top with a lighter underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. The Livermore oak is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate."
