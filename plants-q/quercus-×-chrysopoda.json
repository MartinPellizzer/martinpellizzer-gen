    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 chrysopoda, commonly known as the golden chinquapin, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a cross between Quercus prinus (southern red oak) and Quercus falcata (Cumberland oak), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its leathery, glossy leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color. It produces small, elongated acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
