    "intro": "Quercus pubescens var. syspirensis, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut, is a variant of the downy oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. However, it is also susceptible to fungal diseases and has limited economic use compared to other oak species."
