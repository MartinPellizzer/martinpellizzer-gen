    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. sublobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its elliptical to oblong leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical sessile oak. The leaves are often finely toothed and have a pointed tip, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and forest edges. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
