    "intro": "Quercus xanthotricha, commonly known as the yellow-chestnut oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, acorn-like fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. This plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
