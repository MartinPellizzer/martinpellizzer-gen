It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Quercus obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems."
