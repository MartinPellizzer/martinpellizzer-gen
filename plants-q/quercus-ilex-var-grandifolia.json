    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. grandifolia, commonly known as the evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery evergreen leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This hardy species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
