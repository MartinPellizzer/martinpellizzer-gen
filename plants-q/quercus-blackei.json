    "intro": "Quercus blackei, commonly known as the Black's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high elevations and cool, moist climates. Its ecological significance is notable in supporting local biodiversity and contributing to the structure of its habitat. Quercus blackei is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used by indigenous communities."
