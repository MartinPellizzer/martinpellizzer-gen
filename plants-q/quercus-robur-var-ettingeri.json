    "intro": "Quercus robur var. ettingeri, commonly known as the Ettinger oak, is a rare variant of the common oak. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring deeply lobed leaves with a unique shape compared to typical Quercus robur. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in specific microhabitats within its native range. Its acorns are small and typically have a smooth cap, which is a notable botanical feature. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential genetic distinctiveness."
