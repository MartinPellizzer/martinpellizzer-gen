    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 cocksii, commonly known as the Cocksii oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus garryana and Quercus rugosa. It is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, characterized by its distinctive elliptical leaves with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils in woodland and open habitats. The Cocksii oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
