    "intro": "Quamoclit globosa, commonly known as the globular quillwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Podostomata. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its unique growth habit, often forming dense clusters in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has no true roots, instead relying on its rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Its leaves are typically scale-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Quamoclit globosa is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid environments."
