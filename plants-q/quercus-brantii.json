It is characterized by its robust, twisted trunk and dark, fissured bark. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. It produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This hardy species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in harsh, arid environments."
