    "intro": "Quercus patelliformis, commonly known as the Patelliform oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus patelliformis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
