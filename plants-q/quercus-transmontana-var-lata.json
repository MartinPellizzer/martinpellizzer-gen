    "intro": "Quercus transmontana var. lata, commonly known as the broad-leaved white oak, is a variant of the white oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to other oak varieties. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. This variant is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
