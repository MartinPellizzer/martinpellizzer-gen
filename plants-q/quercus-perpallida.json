    "intro": "Quercus perpallida, commonly known as the pale oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, spreading crown and pale green to whitish bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip, and they turn a striking yellow or red in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
