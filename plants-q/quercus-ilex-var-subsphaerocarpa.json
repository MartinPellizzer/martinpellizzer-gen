    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. subsphaerocarpa, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the tree throughout the winter. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are edible and serve as a food source for various wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. This subspecies is adapted to Mediterranean climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
