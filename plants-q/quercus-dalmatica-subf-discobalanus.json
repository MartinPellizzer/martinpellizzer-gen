    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica subf. discobalanus, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak, is a subspecies of the oak tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests. The botanical features of this subspecies make it an important component of the region's flora and ecological systems."
