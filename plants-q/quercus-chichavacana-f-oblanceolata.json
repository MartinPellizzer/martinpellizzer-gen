    "intro": "Quercus chichavacana f. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chinquapin oak, is a rare and endemic species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its oblong, glossy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
