    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 riparia, commonly known as the river oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the white oak (Quercus alba) and the chestnut oak (Quercus prinus). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus \u00d7 riparia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplain forests. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
