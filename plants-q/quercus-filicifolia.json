    "intro": "Quercus filicifolia, commonly known as the laceleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically 10\u201320 cm long and have a bright green upper surface with a pale underside. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a scaly cap. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in floodplain forests."
