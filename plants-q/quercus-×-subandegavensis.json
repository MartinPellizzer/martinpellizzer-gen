    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 subandegavensis, commonly known as the Andean white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus humboldtii and Quercus berberidifolia. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Peru and Bolivia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Quercus \u00d7 subandegavensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
