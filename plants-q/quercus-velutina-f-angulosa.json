This plant is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically dark green on top and pale underneath, with a velvety texture. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is often found in mixed hardwood forests and is valued for its ecological role and historical use in timber."
