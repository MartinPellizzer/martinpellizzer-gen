    "intro": "Quercus laxa, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, turning yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small, typically less than 1 inch in length, and are enclosed in a cupule with bracts. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in regions with low rainfall."
