    "intro": "Quercus pillyraeoides, commonly known as the Pillyraeoides oak, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the humid forests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, scaly cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in understorey positions within dense vegetation. Quercus pillyraeoides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
