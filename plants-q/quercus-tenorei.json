    "intro": "Quercus tenorei, commonly known as the Sicilian oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sicily. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits. Quercus tenorei is characterized by its strong, twisted trunk and is often found in scrubland and maquis vegetation. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
