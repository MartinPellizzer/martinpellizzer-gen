    "intro": "Quercus afghanistanensis, commonly known as the Afghan oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and it produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Botanically, it is characterized by its strong, twisted trunk and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species."
