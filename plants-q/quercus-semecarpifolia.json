    "intro": "Quercus semecarpifolia, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Quercus semecarpifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
