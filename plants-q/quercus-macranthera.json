    "intro": "Quercus macranthera, commonly known as the Chinese white oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorn-producing capabilities. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, while its acorns are small and have a cap that covers most of the nut. Quercus macranthera is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
