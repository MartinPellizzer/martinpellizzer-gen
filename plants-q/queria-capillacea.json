    "intro": "Queria capillacea, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Queria capillacea produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
