    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf woolly oak, is a small shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, red or brown acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetland or swampy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
