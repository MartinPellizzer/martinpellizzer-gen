    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora subsp. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence on the leaves and stems, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a pointed tip and a rough, sometimes lobed margin. It produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, typical of the Fagaceae family. This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
