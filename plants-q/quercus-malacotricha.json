    "intro": "Quercus malacotricha, commonly known as the Malacotricha oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
