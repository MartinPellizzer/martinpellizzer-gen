    "intro": "Quercus racemosa var. nannetensis, commonly known as the Nannet's water oak, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable component of local biodiversity."
