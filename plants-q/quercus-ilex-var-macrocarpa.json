    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaved evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, providing dense shade. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of natural and landscaped environments."
