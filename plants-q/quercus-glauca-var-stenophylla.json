    "intro": "Quercus glauca var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blue oak, is a variant of the blue oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule, which is a feature common to many oak species. The botanical features of this variant make it well adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage."
