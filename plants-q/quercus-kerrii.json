    "intro": "Quercus kerrii, commonly known as Kerri's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Thailand and Vietnam. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus kerrii thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
