    "intro": "Quercus phillyreoides var. crispa, commonly known as the crinkled oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled, and often lobed leaves that give it a unique appearance. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a rough texture. It produces small, clustered acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
