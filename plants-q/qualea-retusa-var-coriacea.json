    "intro": "Qualea retusa var. coriacea, commonly known as the rigid water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that provide buoyancy and protection against herbivores. The plant has a short, stout stem and produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip and are covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. This species is adapted to slow-moving freshwater environments and plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems."
