    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 bertrandii, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rugosa and Quercus lobata. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy cap. Native to central Mexico, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, scrubland environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in arid landscapes."
