    "intro": "Quercus litoralis, commonly known as the maritime oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and robust, twisted trunk that often grows in rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are leathery and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. This plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
