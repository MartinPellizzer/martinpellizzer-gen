    "intro": "Quercus irazuensis, commonly known as the Irazu oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Costa Rica. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
