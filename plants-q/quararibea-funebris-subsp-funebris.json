    "intro": "Quararibea funebris subsp. funebris, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dark, heavy wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its dense wood, it has been historically used for construction and furniture-making."
