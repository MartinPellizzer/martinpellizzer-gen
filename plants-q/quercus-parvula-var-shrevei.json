    "intro": "Quercus parvula var. shrevei, commonly known as the Shreve oak, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, featuring a rounded or irregular crown with a dense, gnarled appearance. The leaves are oval to elliptic, with smooth margins and a dark green upper surface that turns reddish-brown in autumn. Its acorns are small, with a shallow cupule and a chestnut-like flavor, often attracting wildlife. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riverine habitats."
