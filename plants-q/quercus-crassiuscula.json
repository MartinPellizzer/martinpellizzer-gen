    "intro": "Quercus crassiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, scaly cap. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in its native habitat."
