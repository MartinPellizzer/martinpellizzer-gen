    "intro": "Quercus pubescens f. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sessile oak, is a rare form of the sessile oak characterized by its distinctive leaf shape. The leaves are elongated and have a narrow, beak-like tip, distinguishing it from the typical sessile oak. It is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions of Spain and Portugal. The plant is typically found in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in the field of plant morphology and ecology."
