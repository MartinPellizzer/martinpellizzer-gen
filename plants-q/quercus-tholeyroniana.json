    "intro": "Quercus tholeyroniana, commonly known as the Tholeyronian oak, is a rare and endemic species native to a specific region in South America. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, and it produces small, spiky acorns that are dispersed by animals. Its botanical structure includes a sturdy trunk with a thick, furrowed bark, and it has a shallow root system adapted to its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
