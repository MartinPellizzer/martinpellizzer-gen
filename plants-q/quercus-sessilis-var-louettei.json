    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. louettei, commonly known as the Louette oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid forests of western Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a distinctive dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its acorns are small, with a short stalk, and are an important food source for local wildlife. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland areas."
