    "intro": "Quararibea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed guayacan, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Quararibea angustifolia is often found in dry forest or scrubland habitats and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and historical contexts."
