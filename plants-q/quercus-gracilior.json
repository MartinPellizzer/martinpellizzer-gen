    "intro": "Quercus gracilior, commonly known as the slender oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Quercus gracilior thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
