It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and elliptical, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, pale green acorns that are enclosed in cupules with bristly hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodlands and canyons. Quercus dugesii plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
