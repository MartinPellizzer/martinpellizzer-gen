    "intro": "Quercus agrifolia var. oxyadenia, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a variant of the California live oak. It is a deciduous tree native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard variety, with a leathery texture and a waxy coating. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. This variant is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and dry summers."
