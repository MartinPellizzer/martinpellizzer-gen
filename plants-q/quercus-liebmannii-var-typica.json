    "intro": "Quercus liebmannii var. typica, commonly known as the Liebmann's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and dark, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
