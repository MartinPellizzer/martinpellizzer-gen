    "intro": "Quamasia cusickii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a robust, branching stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Quamasia cusickii is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
