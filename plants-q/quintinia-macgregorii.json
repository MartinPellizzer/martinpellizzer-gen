    "intro": "Quintinia macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's quintinia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast against its grayish bark. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in spring, which are followed by dark blue, spherical berries. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Quintinia macgregorii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
