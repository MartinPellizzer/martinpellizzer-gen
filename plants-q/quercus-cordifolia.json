    "intro": "Quercus cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown flowers in the spring, which are followed by acorns that mature the following year. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus cordifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
