    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 schuettei, commonly known as the Schuette oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to southern California. It is a cross between Quercus parvula and Quercus rugosa, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a waxy coating. It produces small, pale green acorns that are typically eaten by wildlife. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
