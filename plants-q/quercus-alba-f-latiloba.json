    "intro": "Quercus alba f. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed white oak, is a variant of the white oak characterized by its broader, more pronounced leaf lobes. This form is typically found in the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough, hairy texture. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that mature over a year, providing food for various wildlife. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
