    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. microlepis, commonly known as the dwarf silky oak, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a prominent midrib. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique appearance."
