    "intro": "Quercus borealis f. flabellata, commonly known as the white oak variant with flabellate leaves, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, fan-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, spiky capsules that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a common sight in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
