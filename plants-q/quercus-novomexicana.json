    "intro": "Quercus novomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The New Mexico oak plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
