    "intro": "Quercus affinis, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky capsules that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests and open woodlands. The Florida maple is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
