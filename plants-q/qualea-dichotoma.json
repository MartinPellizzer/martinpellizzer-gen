    "intro": "Qualea dichotoma, commonly known as the water lily of the Amazon, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically broad and oval in shape, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in the early morning. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrates of its habitat. Qualea dichotoma plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
