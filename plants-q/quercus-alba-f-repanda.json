    "intro": "Quercus alba f. repanda, commonly known as the broad-leaf white oak, is a naturally occurring variant of the white oak characterized by its broader, more rounded leaves. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically larger and have a more pronounced lobing compared to the typical white oak. This form is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities. It shares the same ecological role as other white oaks, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
