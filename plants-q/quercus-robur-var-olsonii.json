    "intro": "Quercus robur var. olsonii, commonly known as the Olson's Oak, is a rare variant of the common English oak. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a unique combination of lobes and serrations. The tree typically grows in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its acorns are smaller than those of the standard Quercus robur and are often used in ecological studies. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
