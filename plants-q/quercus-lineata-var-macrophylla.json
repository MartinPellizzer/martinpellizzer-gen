    "intro": "Quercus lineata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf willow oak, is a variant of the willow oak species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, willow-like leaves that are typically 6 to 12 inches long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, pale green to yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its male flowers, while female flowers are clustered in small, spiky inflorescences. The leaves turn a striking yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. This species is often cultivated for its graceful form and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice in landscaping."
