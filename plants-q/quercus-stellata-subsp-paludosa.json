It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and bottomland hardwood forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian and wetland ecosystems."
