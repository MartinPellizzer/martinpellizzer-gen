    "intro": "Quercus petraea var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and dark green, leathery leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces acorns that are relatively large compared to other oak species, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed woodlands and forest edges. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance as the tree matures."
