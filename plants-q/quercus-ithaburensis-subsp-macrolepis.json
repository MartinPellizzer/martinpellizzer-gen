It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
