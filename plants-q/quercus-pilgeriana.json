    "intro": "Quercus pilgeriana, commonly known as the Coulter oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a thick, cup-like structure, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It typically grows in mountainous regions and has a rugged, twisted trunk that contributes to its rugged appearance. The Coulter oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
