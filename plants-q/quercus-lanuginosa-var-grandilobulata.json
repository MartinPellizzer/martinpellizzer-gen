    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. grandilobulata, commonly known as the silky oak or satinash, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its distinctive, smooth, light-gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions."
