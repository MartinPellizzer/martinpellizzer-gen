    "intro": "Quercus wilhelminae, commonly known as the Wilhelmine oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, velvety cap. Its bark is smooth and greyish in youth, becoming fissured with age. Quercus wilhelminae plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
