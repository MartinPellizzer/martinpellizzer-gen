    "intro": "Quercus dalechampii f. macroloba, commonly known as the large-leaf sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves. This subspecies is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that mature over a season. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
