    "intro": "Quercus litigiosa, commonly known as the fighting oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature over the summer. Quercus litigiosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystem in its native range."
