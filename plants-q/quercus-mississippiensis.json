    "intro": "Quercus mississippiensis, commonly known as the Mississippian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 50 feet and has a broad, spreading canopy. The bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance."
