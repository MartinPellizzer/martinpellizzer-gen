    "intro": "Quercus rossii f. arsenei, commonly known as the Arseni's oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Ross's oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a more elongated shape and a distinct venation pattern compared to typical Quercus species. The plant is native to specific regions in Mexico, where it thrives in humid, mountainous environments. Its acorns are small and often have a smooth cap, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
