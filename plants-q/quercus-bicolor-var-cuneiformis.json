    "intro": "Quercus bicolor var. cuneiformis, commonly known as the northern pin oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
