    "intro": "Quinchamalium berteroanum, commonly known as the Guayaquil orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Colombia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display a mix of red, yellow, and orange hues. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Quinchamalium berteroanum plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
