    "intro": "Quercus ovicarpa, commonly known as the oval-fruit oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama. The plant is characterized by its elliptical acorns, which are typically enclosed in a cupule with dense, scaly bracts. Its leaves are generally elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Quercus ovicarpa typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in upland forests or along stream banks."
