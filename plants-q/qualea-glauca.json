    "intro": "Qualea glauca, commonly known as the white water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the day and close at night. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes help spread vegetatively. Qualea glauca plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems."
