    "intro": "Quercus sonomensis, commonly known as the Sonoma oak, is a deciduous tree native to California. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
