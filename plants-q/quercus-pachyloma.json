    "intro": "Quercus pachyloma, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fire and drought."
