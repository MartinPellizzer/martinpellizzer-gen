It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is native to the Iberian Peninsula. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for a variety of climates. The Morisii oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and gardens."
