    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. avellaniformis, commonly known as the Spanish oak, is a variant of the evergreen holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or oval in shape. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in Mediterranean climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and reforestation projects."
