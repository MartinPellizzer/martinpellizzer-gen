    "intro": "Quercus lineata var. fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' rock oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often grayish-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
