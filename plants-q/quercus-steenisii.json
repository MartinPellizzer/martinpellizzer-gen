    "intro": "Quercus steenisii, commonly known as the Stanislaus oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus steenisii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
