    "intro": "Quercus robur var. armeniaca, commonly known as the Armenian oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits. It is a deciduous tree that typically reaches heights of 20 to 30 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are usually lobed, with a serrated margin, and can vary in size depending on environmental conditions. Its acorns are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common to many oak species, and serve as a food source for various wildlife. This variety is native to the Caucasus region and is adapted to a range of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils."
