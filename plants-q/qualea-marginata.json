    "intro": "Qualea marginata, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive yellowish margin. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close in the heat of the day. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats. Qualea marginata plays an important role in the aquatic ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
