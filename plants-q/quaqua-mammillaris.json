It is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals but serves as a defense mechanism. The plant typically has opposite, simple leaves and produces clusters of small, usually pink or white flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Quaqua mammillaris plays an important role in supporting certain insect populations, including monarch butterflies."
