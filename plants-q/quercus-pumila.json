    "intro": "Quercus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called acorns, which are typically found in clusters. Quercus pumila thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory in its native habitat."
