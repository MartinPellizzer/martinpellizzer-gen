    "intro": "Quekettia papillosa, commonly known as the pink-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Quekettia papillosa is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake."
