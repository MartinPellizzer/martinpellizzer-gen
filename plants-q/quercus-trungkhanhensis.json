    "intro": "Quercus trungkhanhensis, commonly known as the Trung Khanh oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam, specifically the Trung Khanh district in Lao Cai province. This evergreen tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
