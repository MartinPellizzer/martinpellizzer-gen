    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evergreen oak, is a variant of the holm oak characterized by its smaller, narrower leaves compared to the typical Q. ilex. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula, where it thrives in Mediterranean climates. The leaves are usually leathery and dark green, with a serrated margin, and they turn reddish-brown in autumn before dropping. This plant produces small, dense acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions makes it a hardy, ornamental plant in landscaping."
