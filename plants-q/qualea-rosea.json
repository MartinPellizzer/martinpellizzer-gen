    "intro": "Qualea rosea, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, often displaying a pale pink to white coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close during the day. Its roots are anchored in the muddy substrate, allowing it to thrive in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats. Qualea rosea plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
