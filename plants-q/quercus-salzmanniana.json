    "intro": "Quercus salzmanniana, commonly known as the Salzmann oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, pale yellow to brownish flowers in early spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. The Salzmann oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive form and hardy nature."
