    "intro": "Quercus reticulata var. conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered net-veined oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the net-veined oak. It is characterized by its intricate, reticulate leaf venation pattern, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically small, elliptical, and have a glossy upper surface with a lighter underside. This species is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
