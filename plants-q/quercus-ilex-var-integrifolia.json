    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. integrifolia, commonly known as the holm oak, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically entire, giving it its scientific name \"integrifolia,\" meaning \"whole-leaved.\" The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for coastal and rocky environments. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a valuable component of Mediterranean ecosystems."
