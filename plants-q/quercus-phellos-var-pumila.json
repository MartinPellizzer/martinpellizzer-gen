It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, red to brown acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streams. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and landscape use in suitable climates."
