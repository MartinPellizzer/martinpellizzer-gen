    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa subsp. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are hairy on both surfaces, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule, which is often covered with dense, velvety hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
