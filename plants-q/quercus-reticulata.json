    "intro": "Quercus reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its intricate, net-like leaf venation, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along riverbanks."
