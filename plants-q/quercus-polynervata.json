    "intro": "Quercus polynervata, commonly known as the broad-leafed oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, visible veins. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Quercus polynervata is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
