    "intro": "Quercus cerris subf. dentatolaciniata, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a subspecies of the common oak characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits. It features broad, lobed leaves with a serrated margin, which contribute to its ornamental value. The tree typically grows as a tall, spreading specimen with a rounded crown, often reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its acorns are small and usually have a shallow cupule, and the bark is thick and fissured, providing structural resilience. This subspecies is native to the Balkans and Anatolia, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils."
