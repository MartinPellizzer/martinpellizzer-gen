    "intro": "Quercus planipocula f. subsessilifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved white oak, is a rare variant of the white oak species. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically sessile or nearly sessile, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its acorns are small and usually have a shallow cupule, which is a key identifying feature. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
