    "intro": "Quercus wolgensis, commonly known as the Wolgensis oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The tree is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus wolgensis is considered a rare and endangered plant."
