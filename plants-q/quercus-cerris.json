    "intro": "Quercus cerris, commonly known as the Turkish oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountains of Turkey, the Balkans, and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Quercus cerris is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often planted for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
