It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves with short petioles and prominent glandular hairs on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
