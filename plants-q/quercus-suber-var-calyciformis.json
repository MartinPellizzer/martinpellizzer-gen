    "intro": "Quercus suber var. calyciformis, commonly known as the Gibraltar cork oak, is a variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark, which is highly valued for cork production. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. This species is adapted to Mediterranean climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
