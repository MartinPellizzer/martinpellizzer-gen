    "intro": "Quercus virginiana f. grandifolia, commonly known as the live oak, is a variant of the southern live oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, spreading crown and evergreen foliage, with large, leathery leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its extensive root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and resistant to wind damage."
