    "intro": "Quercus glareosa, commonly known as the shining oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing structural support and protection against environmental stressors. Quercus glareosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands."
