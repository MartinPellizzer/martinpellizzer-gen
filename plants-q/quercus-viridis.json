It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its acorns are typically enclosed in a cupule. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Quercus viridis has a slow growth rate and can live for over 200 years, making it a long-lived species. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
