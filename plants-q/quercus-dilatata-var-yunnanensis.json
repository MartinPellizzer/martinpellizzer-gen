    "intro": "Quercus dilatata var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan white oak, is a variant of the broad-leaved oak native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale gray bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are often pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fuzzy cap. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
