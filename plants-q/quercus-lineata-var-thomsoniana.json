    "intro": "Quercus lineata var. thomsoniana, commonly known as Thomson's boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive, boxwood-like appearance, making it popular in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, exhibiting moderate drought tolerance once established. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it ideal for use as a foundation plant or in rock gardens."
