    "intro": "Quararibea ruiziana, commonly known as the Guianan mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities, making it a significant species in local economies and ecosystems. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
