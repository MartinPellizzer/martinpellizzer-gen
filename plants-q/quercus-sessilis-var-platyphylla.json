    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically lobed and have a smooth upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are usually enclosed in a dense, hairy cap. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and forest edges. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other oak species, particularly in its leaf morphology and acorn structure."
