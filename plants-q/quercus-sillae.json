    "intro": "Quercus sillae, commonly known as the Silla oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the island of Silla in the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Quercus sillae thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to the biodiversity of its native region."
