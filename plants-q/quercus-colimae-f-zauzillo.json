    "intro": "Quercus colimae f. zauzillo, commonly known as the Zauzillo oak, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are typically lobed and have a serrated margin. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, the Zauzillo oak is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
