    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 cazanensis, commonly known as the C\u0103z\u0103na\u0219ii oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris and Quercus frainetto. It is a deciduous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a broad, spreading crown and deeply lobed leaves. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. The bark is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
