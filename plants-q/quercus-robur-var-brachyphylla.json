    "intro": "Quercus robur var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf English oak, is a variant of the common oak characterized by its shorter, more compact growth habit. It features broad, lobed leaves that are typically darker green and have a rough, hairy texture on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
