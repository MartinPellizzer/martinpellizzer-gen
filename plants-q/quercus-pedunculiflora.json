    "intro": "Quercus pedunculiflora, commonly known as the Persian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated acorns and dark, glossy leaves that turn red in the autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age. The Persian oak is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters."
