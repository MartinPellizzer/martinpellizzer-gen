    "intro": "Quercus coccifera var. vera, commonly known as the Algerian rock oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, red, fleshy fruits known as drupes. The plant is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing on limestone soils. It has a dense root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This variety is distinct from the typical Q. coccifera due to its unique leaf shape and habitat preferences."
