    "intro": "Quercus nana, commonly known as the dwarf oak, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The plant is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. Quercus nana produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments."
