    "intro": "Quinchamalium, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. Quinchamalium species are often found in dry, tropical regions and are valued for their durable, aromatic wood. Due to overharvesting, many species are now threatened with extinction."
