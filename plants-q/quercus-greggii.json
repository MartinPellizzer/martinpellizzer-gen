    "intro": "Quercus greggii, commonly known as the Gregg's oak, is a small evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Quercus greggii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions."
