    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. amplifolia, commonly known as the woolly oak or broadleaf oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with serrated margins and a pale underside. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are important for wildlife, particularly squirrels and birds."
