    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 bimundorum, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus lobata and Quercus rugosa. It is native to the central and southern regions of Mexico, where it thrives in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
