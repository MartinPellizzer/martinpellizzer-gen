    "intro": "Quercus similis, commonly known as the similar oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is typically gray and becomes fissured with age. Quercus similis is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
