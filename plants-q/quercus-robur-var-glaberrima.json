    "intro": "Quercus robur var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-silvery oak, is a variant of the English oak characterized by its smooth, silvery bark and smaller leaves compared to the typical Quercus robur. It is native to parts of Europe and is adapted to temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its growth habit is typically slow, leading to a dense, rounded canopy over time. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological contributions in forest ecosystems."
