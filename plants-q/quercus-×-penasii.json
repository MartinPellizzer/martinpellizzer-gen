    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 penasii, commonly known as the Penasii oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered with a dense, scaly cap. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests in Europe. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parentage."
