    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 porteri, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus mexicana. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically pale to medium green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule with bracts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that is typical of many oak species."
