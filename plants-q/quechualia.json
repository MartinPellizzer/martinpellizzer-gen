    "intro": "Quechualia, commonly known as the \"flower of the Andes,\" is a striking member of the Solanaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and white flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract a variety of pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of the Andean mountains. Its leaves are broad and serrated, while its stems are woody and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Quechualia is not only valued for its ornamental beauty but also has traditional uses in local medicine."
