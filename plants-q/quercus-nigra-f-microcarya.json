    "intro": "Quercus nigra f. microcarya, commonly known as the dwarf black oak, is a compact variant of the black oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, dense growth habit and dark, glossy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical black oak. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects."
