    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree with thick, leathery leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the Fagaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
