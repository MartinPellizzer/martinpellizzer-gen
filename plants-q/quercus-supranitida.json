    "intro": "Quercus supranitida, commonly known as the Philippine mahogany oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by acorn-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is also valued for its timber."
