    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 eborense, commonly known as the hybrid oak, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, often displaying a combination of leaf shape, bark texture, and growth habits. This species is native to Europe and is typically found in mixed forests and woodland areas. It is a medium to large deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its ornamental value."
