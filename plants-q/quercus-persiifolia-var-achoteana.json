    "intro": "Quercus persiifolia var. achoteana, commonly known as the Achote Oak, is a rare and specialized variant of the Persian Oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring broad, ovate leaves with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Iran, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its acorns are small and are often used in local traditional practices. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
