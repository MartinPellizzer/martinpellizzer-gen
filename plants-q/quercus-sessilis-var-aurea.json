    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. aurea, commonly known as the golden sessile oak, is a variant of the sessile oak native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more pronounced in autumn, setting it apart from the typical green leaves of other oak species. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically harvested by wildlife such as squirrels and jays. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in parks and private landscapes for its aesthetic appeal."
