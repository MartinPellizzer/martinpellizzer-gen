    "intro": "Quercus laurina, commonly known as the laurel oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, red-brown acorns. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age. Quercus laurina is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
