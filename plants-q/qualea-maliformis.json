    "intro": "Qualea maliformis, commonly known as the pink water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces small, white flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soft, muddy substrates of its habitat. Qualea maliformis plays an important ecological role in its environment by providing shelter for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
