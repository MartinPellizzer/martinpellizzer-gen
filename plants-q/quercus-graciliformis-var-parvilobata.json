    "intro": "Quercus graciliformis var. parvilobata, commonly known as the small-leaf willow oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream edges. The plant's botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and landscape design in its native habitat."
