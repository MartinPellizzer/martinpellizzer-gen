    "intro": "Quercus nigra f. plenocarpa, commonly known as the black oak with full fruiting, is a botanical variant of the black oak native to eastern North America. This form is characterized by its increased production of acorns, which are typically larger and more numerous compared to the typical black oak. The acorns are encased in a thick, leathery cap and mature over a period of several months. The plant exhibits typical oak morphology, with dark, glossy leaves and a robust, spreading canopy. It plays an important ecological role as a food source for various wildlife species and contributes to forest biodiversity."
