    "intro": "Quercus duraznillo f. pinetorum, commonly known as the Pinetum oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Duraznillo oak. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and a conical tree shape, which sets it apart from other members of the Quercus genus. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, typically found in temperate regions with mild winters. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
