    "intro": "Quercus polycarpa var. welandii, commonly known as the Welander's oak, is a rare and unique variant of the polycarpa oak. It is characterized by its distinctive acorns, which are typically larger and more elongated compared to those of the typical polycarpa. The leaves are usually broad and lobed, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter underside. This species is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in parts of Argentina and Chile. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
