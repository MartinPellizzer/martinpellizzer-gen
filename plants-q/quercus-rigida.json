    "intro": "Quercus rigida, commonly known as the black oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and deeply lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in upland forests. Quercus rigida is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological role in supporting diverse plant and animal life."
