    "intro": "Quercus suber f. subcrinita, commonly known as the hairy cork oak, is a variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark, which is highly valued for cork production. The plant exhibits a distinctive feature of hairy or pubescent shoots, giving it its common name. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. This subspecies is known for its slow growth and longevity, often living over 200 years."
