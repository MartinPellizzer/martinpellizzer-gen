    "intro": "Quercus aliena var. monstrosa, commonly known as the monstrous alien oak, is a rare and striking variant of the alien oak species. It is characterized by its unusually large, twisted leaves and gnarled, sprawling branches that give it a dramatic, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant exhibits unique morphological traits, including variegated foliage and a tendency to grow in dense, tangled masses. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in remote, temperate regions with high humidity. Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
