    "intro": "Quercus consociata, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and alternate, simple, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a hairy cupule, a feature typical of many oak species. Quercus consociata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
