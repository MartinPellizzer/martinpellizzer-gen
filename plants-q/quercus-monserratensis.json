    "intro": "Quercus monserratensis, commonly known as the Montserrat oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
