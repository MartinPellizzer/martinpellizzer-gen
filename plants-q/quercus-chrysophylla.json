    "intro": "Quercus chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the autumn season. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, temperate climates."
