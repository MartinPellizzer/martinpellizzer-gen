    "intro": "Quercus faginea subvar. vulgaris, commonly known as the common hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically oval or elliptical with a pointed tip and finely toothed margins. It produces small, spiky, cup-shaped fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in temperate climates."
