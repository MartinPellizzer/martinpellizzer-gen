    "intro": "Quercus robur var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf English oak, is a variant of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its smaller, more narrow leaves compared to the typical Quercus robur. The tree produces acorns that are often smaller and have a more pronounced cap than those of the standard oak. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and forested areas. The bark is typically gray and fissured, providing a rugged appearance."
