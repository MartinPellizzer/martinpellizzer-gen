    "intro": "Quercus cedrosensis, commonly known as Cedros Island oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the island of Cedros in the Gulf of California. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. The tree typically grows in coastal scrub and rocky habitats, adapting to the arid and saline conditions of its environment. It plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
