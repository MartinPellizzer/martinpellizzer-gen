    "intro": "Quercus lutea, commonly known as the golden oak, is a deciduous tree native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow leaves, which turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus lutea typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of its native ecosystems."
