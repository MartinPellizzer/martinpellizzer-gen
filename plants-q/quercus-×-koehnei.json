    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 koehnei, commonly known as the Koehne's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur and Quercus sessilifolia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a rounded crown and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly covering, which helps protect the seeds from herbivores. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. The botanical characteristics of Quercus \u00d7 koehnei make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural applications."
