It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in terminal panicles, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Quassia multiflora is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its bitter compounds. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in humid, lowland forests."
