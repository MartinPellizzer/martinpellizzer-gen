    "intro": "Quercus nigra f. saxicola, commonly known as the rocky black oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the black oak. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, rugged bark, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. This form is typically found in mountainous regions where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually smaller and more leathery compared to the typical black oak. The plant exhibits a high degree of morphological variation, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
