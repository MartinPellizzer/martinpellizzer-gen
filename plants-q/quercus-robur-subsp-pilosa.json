    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy oak, is a subspecies of the common oak native to Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves that are often larger and more lobed than those of the typical Q. robur. The tree produces acorns that are typically smaller and more numerous compared to other oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed woodlands. The subspecies is notable for its distinctive appearance and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
