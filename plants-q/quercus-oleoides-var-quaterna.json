    "intro": "Quercus oleoides var. quaterna, commonly known as the four-leaf oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white oak. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring four lobes instead of the typical three. The plant is native to specific regions of southern Europe, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Its acorns are small and often used in local ecosystems as a food source for wildlife. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
