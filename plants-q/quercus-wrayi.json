    "intro": "Quercus wrayi, commonly known as the Wray oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
