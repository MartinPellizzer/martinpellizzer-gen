    "intro": "Quercus pinnativenulosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its lanceolate leaves with prominent, parallel venation patterns that give it its scientific name. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. The bark of Quercus pinnativenulosa is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age."
