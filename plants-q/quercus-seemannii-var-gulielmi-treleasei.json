    "intro": "Quercus seemannii var. gulielmi-treleasei, commonly known as the Trelawney oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Jamaica. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and acorns that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The plant belongs to the Fagaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique morphology. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
