    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. dissecta, commonly known as the dissected pedunculate oak, is a variant of the pedunculate oak native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely dissected leaves that resemble those of a maple, with a serrated margin and a lobed structure. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests. Its acorns are small and often have a scaly cap, and it produces copious amounts of catkins in the spring. This species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
