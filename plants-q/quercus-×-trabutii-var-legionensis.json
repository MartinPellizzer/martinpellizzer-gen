    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 trabutii var. legionensis, commonly known as the Legion Valley oak, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Turkey. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The acorns of this species are small and often have a distinctive cap that covers the nut. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with distinct seasonal changes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
