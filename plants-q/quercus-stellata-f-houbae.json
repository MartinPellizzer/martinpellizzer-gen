    "intro": "Quercus stellata f. houbae, commonly known as the Houbae dwarf chinquapin, is a rare and unique variant of the Texas chinquapin. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, acorn-like fruits. The plant exhibits a dense, shrub-like form with thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is typically found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
