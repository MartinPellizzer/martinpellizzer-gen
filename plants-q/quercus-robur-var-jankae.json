    "intro": "Quercus robur var. jankae, commonly known as the Jankai oak, is a variant of the English oak that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a deciduous tree native to parts of Central Europe, particularly in regions of Germany and the Czech Republic. The leaves are typically broader and more lobed compared to the standard Quercus robur, with a serrated margin. Its acorns are smaller and more rounded, and the bark is smoother than that of the common oak. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
