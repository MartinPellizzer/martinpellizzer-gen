It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. Quercus mexiae typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a rounded crown. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in oak-hickory woodlands."
