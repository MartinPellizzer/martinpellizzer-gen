    "intro": "Quamoclit purpureus, commonly known as the purple quamoclit, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its striking purple to reddish-pink flowers, which bloom in dense, branching clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Quamoclit purpureus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
