    "intro": "Quercus ilex var. genabii, commonly known as the Genabii holm oak, is a rare variant of the holm oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically leathery and glossy, and its robust, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
