    "intro": "Quercus hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with dark green, leathery leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense, fibrous cap. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
