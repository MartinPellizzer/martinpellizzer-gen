    "intro": "Quercus taitoensis, commonly known as the Taito oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus taitoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
