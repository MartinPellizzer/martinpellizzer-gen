    "intro": "Quercus strigosa, commonly known as the bristly oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family Fagaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. This evergreen shrub or small tree has dark green, leathery leaves with a rough, bristly texture on the upper surface. The plant produces acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, which is characteristic of the Fagaceae family. Quercus strigosa thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, rocky or sandy soils."
