    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 neomairei, commonly known as the Neomaire's oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus robur (English oak) and Quercus petraea (sessile oak). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and acorn-producing capsules. The plant exhibits intermediate features between its parent species, such as bark texture and leaf morphology. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Botanically, it is notable for its genetic diversity and role in ecological succession."
