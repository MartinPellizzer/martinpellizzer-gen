    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 anceps, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the western United States. It is a cross between Quercus garryi and Quercus petraea, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silvery white underneath. Its acorns are small and have a broad, shallow cupule, and the tree is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
