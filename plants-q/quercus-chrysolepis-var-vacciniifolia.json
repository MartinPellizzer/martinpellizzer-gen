    "intro": "Quercus chrysolepis var. vacciniifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf white oak, is a variant of the white oak native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces acorns that are typically smaller and more numerous than those of the typical white oak. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests."
