    "intro": "Quercus bicolor subsp. michauxii, commonly known as the white oak mapleleaf, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive lobed leaves that transition from a smooth, maple-like shape in spring to a more coarsely toothed form in summer. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically hairy and take about six months to mature. Its bark is light gray and smooth when young, becoming fissured with age. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
