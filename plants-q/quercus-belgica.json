    "intro": "Quercus belgica, commonly known as the Belgian oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, particularly Belgium and parts of France. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps protect the tree from environmental stress."
