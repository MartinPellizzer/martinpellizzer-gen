    "intro": "Quercus pseudococcifera, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
