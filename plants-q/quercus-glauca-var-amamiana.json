    "intro": "Quercus glauca var. amamiana, commonly known as the Amami oak, is a variant of the blue oak native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glaucous, waxy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is adapted to limestone-rich soils."
