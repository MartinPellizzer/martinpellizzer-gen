    "intro": "Quercus tetracarpa, commonly known as the four-fruit oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits that typically occur in clusters of four, giving it its scientific name. The tree has lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open woodlands. The bark of Quercus tetracarpa is thick and fissured, providing protection against fire and drought."
