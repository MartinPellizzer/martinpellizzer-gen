    "intro": "Quararibea mayanum, commonly known as the Mayan mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
