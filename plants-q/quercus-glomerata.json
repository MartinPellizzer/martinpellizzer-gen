    "intro": "Quercus glomerata, commonly known as the bear oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for various insects and lichens. Quercus glomerata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
