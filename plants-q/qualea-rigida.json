    "intro": "Qualea rigida, commonly known as the water lily of the Amazon, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of rivers. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its leaves provide a habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers of Qualea rigida are pollinated by specific species of moths that are active during the evening hours."
