    "intro": "Quercus hastata, commonly known as the slenderleaf oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Quercus hastata thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat diversity in its native range."
