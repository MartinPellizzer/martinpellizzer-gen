    "intro": "Quercus budensis, commonly known as the Budens' oak, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its acorn-like fruit. The plant exhibits evergreen foliage with leathery, elliptical leaves that have a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus budensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
