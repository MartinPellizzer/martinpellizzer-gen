    "intro": "Quercus myrtifolia f. ampla, commonly known as the broadleaf oak, is a variant of the myrtleleaf oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and have a distinctive myrtle-like scent. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that mature over several months. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or riparian habitats. This form exhibits greater leaf size and a more open canopy compared to the typical variety, making it a notable ecological and ornamental species."
