    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina chinquapin, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the chestnut oak (Quercus prinus) and the scarlet oak (Quercus rubra). It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its acorn-like fruits that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated margin, and the bark is rough and fissured. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
