    "intro": "Quekettia theresae var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Quekettia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry climate to flourish. Its limited distribution and unique morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity, it is often found in protected natural habitats and is vulnerable to habitat loss."
