    "intro": "Quercus clathrata, commonly known as the clustered oak, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish-brown acorns, which are encased in a cupule with bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The clustered oak is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
