    "intro": "Quercus lampadaria, commonly known as the Greek oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in rocky and arid soils, often growing in mountainous areas. The Greek oak is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental appeal."
