    "intro": "Quercus fernandezii, commonly known as the Fernandez oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus fernandezii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
