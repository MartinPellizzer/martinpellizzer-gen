    "intro": "Quinchamalium minutum, commonly known as the miniature quinchamalium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecology, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
