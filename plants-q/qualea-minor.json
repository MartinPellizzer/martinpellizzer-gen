    "intro": "Qualea minor, commonly known as the pink river apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy fruits with a pinkish hue. Its fruit is an important food source for various wildlife, including monkeys and birds. Qualea minor plays a significant role in the ecological balance of the rainforest, contributing to biodiversity and nutrient cycling."
