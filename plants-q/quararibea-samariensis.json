    "intro": "Quararibea samariensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its acoustic properties. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy upper surface. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
