    "intro": "Quercus suber f. subocculata, commonly known as the cork oak dwarf form, is a variant of the cork oak native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves compared to the typical cork oak. The plant exhibits dense, shrub-like foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates and thrives in well-drained soils. This form is particularly valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience to drought."
