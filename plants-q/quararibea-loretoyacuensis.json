    "intro": "Quararibea loretoyacuensis, commonly known as the Loretoyacuense balsa, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. It grows as a tree or shrub, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its wood is light and porous, making it historically valuable for buoyancy in boat construction."
