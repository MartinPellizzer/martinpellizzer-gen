    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 exacta, commonly known as the hybrid chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between the chestnut oak (Quercus prinus) and the white oak (Quercus alba). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that mature over a season, and it is often found in the eastern United States. Quercus \u00d7 exacta has a rugged, twisted trunk and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It is relatively drought-tolerant and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
