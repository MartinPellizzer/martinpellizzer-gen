    "intro": "Quercus tommasinii, commonly known as the Mojave oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow to brown flowers in spring, followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat. The Mojave oak plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
