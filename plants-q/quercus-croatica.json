    "intro": "Quercus croatica, commonly known as the Croatian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps protect it from environmental stress."
