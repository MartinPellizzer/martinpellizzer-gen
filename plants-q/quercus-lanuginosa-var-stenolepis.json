    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are enclosed in cupules, a feature common among oaks. Its leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it flowers in the spring with pale yellow to greenish flowers. This species is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy plant in dry climates."
