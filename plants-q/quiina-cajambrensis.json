    "intro": "Quiina cajambrensis, commonly known as the Andean quinoa, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. While not a true quinoa, it is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein and essential amino acids."
