    "intro": "Quercus dalmatica f. tetragona, commonly known as the Dalmatian oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common oak. It is characterized by its unique tetragonal (four-sided) acorns, which set it apart from other oak species. This subspecies is native to the Adriatic region, particularly in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
