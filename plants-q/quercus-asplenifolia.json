    "intro": "Quercus asplenifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of the fern, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. Quercus asplenifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
