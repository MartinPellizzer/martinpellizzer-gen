    "intro": "Quercus nixoniana, commonly known as Nixon's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree throughout the year. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
