    "intro": "Quercus sessilis var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sessile oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long and have a smooth upper surface. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that mature in the fall, providing food for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and scaly, offering some protection against environmental stressors. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
