It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a dense, woolly cap. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and landscape design."
