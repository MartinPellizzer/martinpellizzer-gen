    "intro": "Quercus milroyi, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. Its small, cup-shaped acorns are typically enclosed in a dense, hairy cupule. Quercus milroyi is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native range."
