The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. This subspecies is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
