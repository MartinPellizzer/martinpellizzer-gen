    "intro": "Quercus duraznillo f. cochutensis, commonly known as the Cochut's duraznillo oak, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its deciduous nature. The plant features lobed leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its acorns are small and enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among members of the genus Quercus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
