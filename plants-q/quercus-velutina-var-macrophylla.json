    "intro": "Quercus velutina var. macrophylla, commonly known as the bigleaf chestnut oak, is a variant of the chestnut oak species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that can reach up to 12 inches in length, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are typically enclosed in a cup-like structure with bristly hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The bark of this oak is thick and fissured, providing habitat for various insects and small mammals."
