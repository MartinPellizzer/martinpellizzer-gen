    "intro": "Qiongzhuea verruculosa, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Hainan Island in China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in a branched structure, and its seeds are enclosed in a woody, three-lobed capsule. Qiongzhuea verruculosa is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered an endangered species."
