    "intro": "Quercus welshii, commonly known as Welsh oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to the western coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
