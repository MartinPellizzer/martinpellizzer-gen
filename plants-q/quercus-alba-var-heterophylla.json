    "intro": "Quercus alba var. heterophylla, commonly known as the white oak with variable leaves, is a variant of the white oak native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which can range from elliptical to ovate, depending on environmental conditions. The leaves are typically lobed and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variation in foliage is a key botanical feature that distinguishes it from other oak species. It produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for wildlife."
