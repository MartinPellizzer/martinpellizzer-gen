It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts. The tree is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its acorns are small and typically have a scaly cap, and they are an important food source for wildlife. Quercus zang thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
