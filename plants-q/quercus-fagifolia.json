    "intro": "Quercus fagifolia, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems. Quercus fagifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitats."
