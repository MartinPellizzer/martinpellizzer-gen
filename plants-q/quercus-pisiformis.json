    "intro": "Quercus pisiformis, commonly known as the kidneyleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive kidney-shaped leaves, which are usually lobed and have a rough, hairy texture. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. Its bark is gray and fissured, becoming more rugged with age. Quercus pisiformis is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
