    "intro": "Quercus robur var. vulgaris, commonly known as the English oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its robust, sprawling form and deeply lobed leaves that turn golden in autumn. The tree produces small, chestnut-like acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing habitat for a variety of insects and lichens. The English oak is also valued for its strong, durable wood and has played a significant role in historical and ecological contexts."
