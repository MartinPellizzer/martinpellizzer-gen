It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is usually smooth and grayish in appearance, becoming fissured with age. Quercus angustata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
