    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the live oak (Quercus virginiana) and the Spanish oak (Quercus falcata). It is characterized by its broad, elongated leaves that are typically 6 to 12 inches long, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States. This species is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping and reforestation efforts."
