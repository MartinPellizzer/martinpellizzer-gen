    "intro": "Quercus prinus var. lata, commonly known as the broadleaf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by distinctive, spiny capsules that contain edible acorns. The acorns are encased in a thick, leathery shell and are an important food source for wildlife. This species is well adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
