    "intro": "Quercus leucoclada, commonly known as the white oak of the Canary Islands, is a species of evergreen oak native to the volcanic islands of Tenerife and La Gomera. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically white or pale underneath, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
