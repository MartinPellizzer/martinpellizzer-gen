    "intro": "Quercus rex, commonly known as the royal oak, is a rare and distinctive species of oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that are often lobed and have a unique, almost palmate appearance. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically encased in a dense, hairy cupule. Its bark is thick, fissured, and ranges from gray to reddish-brown, providing a rugged texture. Quercus rex is valued for its ecological importance, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species."
