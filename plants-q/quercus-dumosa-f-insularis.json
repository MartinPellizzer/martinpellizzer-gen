    "intro": "Quercus dumosa f. insularis, commonly known as the island scrub oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in coastal chaparral habitats and is adapted to dry, windy conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
