    "intro": "Quercus calliprinos var. inops, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a variant of the coast live oak native to coastal regions of California. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a broad, rounded crown and thick, leathery leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are encased in a dense, woolly layer, which helps protect the seeds from predators and environmental stress. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to mild, coastal climates with moderate rainfall. This variant is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats, playing a key role in local ecosystems."
