    "intro": "Quercus brantii var. belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's rock oak, is a rare and endemic variant of the rock oak species. It is characterized by its small, acorn-like fruits and leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
