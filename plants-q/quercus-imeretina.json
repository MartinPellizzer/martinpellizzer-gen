    "intro": "Quercus imeretina, commonly known as the Imereti oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous areas with a humid climate. The plant has dark green, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activity."
