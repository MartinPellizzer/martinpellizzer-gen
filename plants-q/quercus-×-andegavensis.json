    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 andegavensis, commonly known as the Andegavensis oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus rubra (red oak) and Quercus velutina (southern red oak). It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and the Carolinas. This tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. Its leaves are lobed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The bark is thick and furrowed, providing a distinctive appearance in mature trees."
