    "intro": "Quercus gomeziana, commonly known as the Gomez's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, subtropical climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, Quercus gomeziana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
