It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its elliptical leaves that are often lobed and have a hairy underside. The plant produces small, pale acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule with bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
