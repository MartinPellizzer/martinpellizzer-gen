    "intro": "Quercus alba var. ryderi, commonly known as Ryder's white oak, is a rare variant of the white oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which includes lobes with a unique, elongated shape compared to typical white oak leaves. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically enclosed in a cupule with bracts. Its bark is thick and fissured, similar to other white oak species, providing some degree of resistance to pests and diseases. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential genetic distinctiveness."
