    "intro": "Quercus ilicifolia, commonly known as the Texas hill country oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Quercus ilicifolia is valued for its ecological role and is often used in restoration projects in its native range."
