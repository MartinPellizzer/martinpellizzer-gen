    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. tortulosa, commonly known as the woolly oak or the dwarf oak, is a shrub-like species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-brown bark and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
