    "intro": "Quercus geminata f. maritima, commonly known as the coastal live oak, is a rare variant of the live oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and compact, spreading growth habit, which allows it to thrive in coastal environments. This form is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it resilient to harsh maritime conditions. The tree produces small, red-brown acorns that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a significant component of coastal ecosystems."
