    "intro": "Quercus roboris, commonly known as the English oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its robust, deeply fissured bark and dark green, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, reddish-brown acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in hedgerows and woodland areas. Quercus roboris is a long-lived species, capable of reaching ages over 1,000 years."
