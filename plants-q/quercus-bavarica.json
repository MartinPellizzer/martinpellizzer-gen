    "intro": "Quercus bavarica, commonly known as the Bavarian oak, is a deciduous tree native to central Europe. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 25 meters. Quercus bavarica is valued for its hard wood and is often found in forested areas across its native range."
