It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small gardens or urban landscapes. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appearance and structural form."
