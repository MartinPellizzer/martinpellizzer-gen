It is a tall, coniferous tree native to the western United States, particularly in coastal regions. The plant has needle-like leaves that are silvery-white underneath, giving it its common name. It produces both male and female cones, with the female cones containing the seeds. This variant is known for its longevity and is often found in mixed forests, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
