    "intro": "Quercus montana, commonly known as the mountain oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows at high elevations, where it adapts to cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. The tree has deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow or red in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. Its acorns are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus montana is valued for its ecological role and is often used in reforestation efforts in its native habitat."
