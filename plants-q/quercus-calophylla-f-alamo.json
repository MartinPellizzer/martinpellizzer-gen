    "intro": "Quercus calophylla f. alamo, commonly known as the Alamo oak, is a rare and unique variant of the California live oak. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and dense, spreading canopy that provides shade in its native habitat. This subspecies is typically found in coastal scrub and chaparral environments along the Pacific coast of California. Its acorns are small and often have a distinctive cap, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. The plant exhibits drought tolerance and is adapted to the mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers of its region."
