    "intro": "Quercus faginea var. maroccana, commonly known as the Maroccan chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Maghreb region of North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its acorns are encased in a dense, scaly cupule. The tree typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with dry summers and mild, wet winters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against fires and pests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
