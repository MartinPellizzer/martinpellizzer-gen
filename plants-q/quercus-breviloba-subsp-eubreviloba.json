It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, spherical acorns that mature over the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
