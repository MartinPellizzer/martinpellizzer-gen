    "intro": "Quercus approximata, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a deciduous tree native to central Mexico. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns that take about six months to mature. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a moderate growth rate. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance and helping to protect the tree from environmental stress."
