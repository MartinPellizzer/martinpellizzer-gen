    "intro": "Quercus colimae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, Quercus colimae is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
