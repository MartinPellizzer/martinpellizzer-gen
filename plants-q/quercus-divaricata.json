    "intro": "Quercus divaricata, commonly known as the variable oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which can range from elliptical to ovate, often with serrated margins. The tree produces acorns that are typically chestnut-like in appearance, with a scaly cap. Its bark is gray and fissured, becoming more rugged with age. Quercus divaricata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
