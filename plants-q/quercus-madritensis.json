    "intro": "Quercus madritensis, commonly known as the Madrid oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Fagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests and along riverbanks. The Madrid oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological and historical significance in the region."
