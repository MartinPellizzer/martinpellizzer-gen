    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa f. pichleri, commonly known as the Pichler's hairy oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the hairy oak species. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a unique appearance compared to other oak species. The leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its characteristic texture. It is native to specific regions in Central Europe, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. This form is often found in shaded, forested environments, where it plays a role in local biodiversity."
