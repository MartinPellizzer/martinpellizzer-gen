    "intro": "Quercus suber f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping cork oak, is a unique variant of the cork oak characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully. This plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and evergreen, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The tree is valued for its slow-growing cork bark, which can be harvested without harming the tree. However, it is less commonly cultivated than the standard cork oak due to its specific environmental requirements."
