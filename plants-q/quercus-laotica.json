    "intro": "Quercus laotica, commonly known as the Laotian oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Laos and parts of Vietnam. This evergreen tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with thick, fissured bark and elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to the biodiversity of its native forests."
