    "intro": "Quercus ilex f. bistonensis, commonly known as the Bistonensis form of the Holm Oak, is a variant of the evergreen oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically smaller and more elliptical compared to the typical form. This form is often found in rocky or coastal areas where it exhibits greater drought tolerance. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a resilient species in Mediterranean climates."
