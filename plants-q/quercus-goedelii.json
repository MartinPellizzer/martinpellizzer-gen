    "intro": "Quercus goedelii, commonly known as the Goedel's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests with cool and moist climates. The plant features broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique subject for ecological and conservation studies. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Quercus goedelii is considered a vulnerable species."
