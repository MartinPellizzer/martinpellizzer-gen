    "intro": "Quercus clementei, commonly known as the Clement's oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5 to 15 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and deeply lobed leaves. The leaves are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a serrated margin. It produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a characteristic feature of the Fagaceae family. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and chaparral habitats."
