    "intro": "Quercus lanuginosa var. glomerata, commonly known as the woolly oak or clustered oak, is a variant of the woolly oak species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and small, acorn-like fruits that are typically clustered in groups of two to four. The leaves are generally elliptical with a serrated margin and a dense covering of fine hairs. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
