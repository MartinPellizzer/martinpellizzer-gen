    "intro": "Quercus martensiana, commonly known as the Mongolian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its serrated leaves, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Quercus martensiana plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
