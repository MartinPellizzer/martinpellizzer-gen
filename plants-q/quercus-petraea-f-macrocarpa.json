    "intro": "Quercus petraea f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a variant of the sessile oak. It is characterized by its large, acorn-like fruits and broad, lobed leaves. This subspecies is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The tree is often found in forested areas and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its botanical features make it an important component of mixed deciduous forests in its native range."
