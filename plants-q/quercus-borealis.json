It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is usually gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, providing a distinctive appearance."
