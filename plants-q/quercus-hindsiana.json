    "intro": "Quercus hindsiana, commonly known as Hinds' oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
