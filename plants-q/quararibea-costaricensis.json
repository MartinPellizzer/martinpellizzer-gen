    "intro": "Quararibea costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican quina, is a small evergreen tree native to Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkin-like structures, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
