    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 robbinsii, commonly known as the scarlet oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the northern red oak (Quercus rubra) and the southern red oak (Quercus falcata). It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with elongated leaves and acorns that are smaller than those of its parents. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability to a range of environmental conditions and its role in forest ecosystems."
