    "intro": "Quercus mongolica f. glabra, commonly known as the Mongolian white oak, is a variant of the Mongolian oak characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark. This tree is native to eastern Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Russia, and thrives in temperate climates. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in forest succession and its contribution to biodiversity in its native habitats."
