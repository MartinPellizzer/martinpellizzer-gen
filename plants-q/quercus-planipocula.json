    "intro": "Quercus planipocula, commonly known as the flat-leaf oak, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are typically lobed and have a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in humid, temperate climates. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
