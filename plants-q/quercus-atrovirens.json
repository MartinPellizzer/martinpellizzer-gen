    "intro": "Quercus atrovirens, commonly known as the blackleaf oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against pests. Quercus atrovirens typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
