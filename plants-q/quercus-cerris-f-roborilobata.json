    "intro": "Quercus cerris f. roborilobata, commonly known as the Turkish oak or the robust oak, is a unique form of the Persian oak. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are broader and more rounded than those of the typical Quercus cerris. This variant exhibits a more open canopy structure, allowing for greater light penetration and a distinct appearance. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils."
