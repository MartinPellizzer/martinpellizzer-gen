    "intro": "Quercus pontica, commonly known as the Pontic oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is thick and furrowed, providing a distinctive appearance in both young and mature trees."
