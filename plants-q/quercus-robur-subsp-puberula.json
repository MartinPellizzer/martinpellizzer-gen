    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. puberula, commonly known as the downy oak, is a subspecies of the common oak characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, typically growing in moist, temperate climates. The leaves are usually oval with a pointed tip and are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The acorns are small and often have a scaly cupule, and the tree can reach heights of up to 30 meters. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed forests and woodlands."
