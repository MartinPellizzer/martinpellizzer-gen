    "intro": "Quararibea sulcata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed guayacan, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Quararibea sulcata is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
