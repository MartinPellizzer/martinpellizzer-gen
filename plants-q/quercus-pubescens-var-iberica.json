It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. It typically grows in mixed forests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
