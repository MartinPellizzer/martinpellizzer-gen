    "intro": "Quercus suber f. dulcis, commonly known as the sweet cork oak, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the cork oak. It is characterized by its thick, smooth bark, which is used in the production of high-quality cork. This plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils. The leaves are typically smaller and more rounded compared to the standard cork oak. It is valued for its unique bark and is often found in forested areas with a specific ecological niche."
