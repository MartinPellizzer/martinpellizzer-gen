    "intro": "Quercus grahamii f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed canyon live oak, is a compact shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and dense, leathery foliage of small, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are typically retained on the plant for extended periods. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important component of its native habitat."
