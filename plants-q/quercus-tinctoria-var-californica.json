It is characterized by its deep green, lobed leaves that turn bronze in the fall. The tree produces small, red acorns that are encased in a cupule, providing food for wildlife. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 feet with a broad, rounded crown. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
