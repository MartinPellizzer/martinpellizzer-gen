    "intro": "Quercus pubescens f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the hairy oak or downy oak, is a variant of the common oak native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves that are pinnately lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a serrated margin. This form is often found in mountainous regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
