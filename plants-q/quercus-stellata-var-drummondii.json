    "intro": "Quercus stellata var. drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the south-central United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, which is distinctive in appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
