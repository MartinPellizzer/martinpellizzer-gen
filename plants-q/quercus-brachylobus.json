    "intro": "Quercus brachylobus, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its rounded crown, thick, leathery leaves with a wavy margin, and small, acorn-like fruits. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and dry summers. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
