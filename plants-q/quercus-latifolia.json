It is characterized by its broad, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Quercus latifolia is valued for its ecological role and is also used in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
