    "intro": "Quercus reticulata f. longa, commonly known as the long-leaved reticulated oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the reticulated oak. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often longer than they are wide. The plant is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Its bark is typically grayish-brown with a rugged texture, and it produces small, acorn-like fruits. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
