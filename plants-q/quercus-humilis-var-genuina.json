    "intro": "Quercus humilis var. genuina, commonly known as the Mexican evergreen oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, leathery, dark green leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a fuzzy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid landscapes."
