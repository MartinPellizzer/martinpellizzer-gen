    "intro": "Quercus aquatica var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved water oak, is a variant of the water oak native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and have a distinct myrtle-like fragrance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near water sources such as rivers and swamps. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by small, inedible acorns. The species is valued for its adaptability to wetland environments and its role in supporting local wildlife."
