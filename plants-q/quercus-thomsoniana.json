    "intro": "Quercus thomsoniana, commonly known as Thomson's oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
