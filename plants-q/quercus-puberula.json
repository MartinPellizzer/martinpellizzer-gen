    "intro": "Quercus puberula, commonly known as the smoothleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Quercus puberula plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance."
