    "intro": "Quercus pedunculata var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chinquapin, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, spiny acorns that are enclosed in a cupule, a feature common among members of the Fagaceae family. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it thrives in well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded environments. The species is also noted for its ecological importance, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
