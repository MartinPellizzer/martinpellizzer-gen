    "intro": "Quercus spinosa subsp. spinosa, commonly known as the brambly oak, is a shrub-like species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or scrubland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental and defensive qualities."
