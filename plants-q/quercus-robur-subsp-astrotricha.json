    "intro": "Quercus robur subsp. astrotricha, commonly known as the Astraloid Oak, is a rare subspecies of the common oak native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a distinct lobing pattern that sets it apart from other Quercus species. The plant exhibits a broadleaf deciduous habit, with deep green foliage that turns reddish-brown in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species."
