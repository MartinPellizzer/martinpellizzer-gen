    "intro": "Quercus geminata var. grandifolia, commonly known as the Florida ash or swamp chestnut oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its distinctive, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The tree produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
