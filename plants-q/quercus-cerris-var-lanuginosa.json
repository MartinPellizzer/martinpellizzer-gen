It is characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence covering the young shoots and leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a short petiole. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey and the Balkans. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique hairy appearance."
