    "intro": "Quercus spicata var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf chestnut oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by red-brown acorns, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
