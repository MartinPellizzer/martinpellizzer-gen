    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 undulata var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf chinquapin, is a hybrid evergreen oak native to the coastal regions of California. It exhibits a unique combination of traits from its parent species, Quercus undulata and Quercus parvula, resulting in a shrub-like form with leathery, elliptical leaves. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a smooth margin, and they remain green throughout the year. It produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats along the coast. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
