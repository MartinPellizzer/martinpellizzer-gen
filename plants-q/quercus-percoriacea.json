    "intro": "Quercus percoriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf oak, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. This evergreen tree is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The tree produces small, cupule-enclosed acorns, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Quercus percoriacea is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in high-altitude forests."
