    "intro": "Quercus douglasii var. novomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico Douglas oak, is a shrub-like evergreen oak native to the southwestern United States. It features small, leathery, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, urn-shaped acorns that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The New Mexico Douglas oak is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
