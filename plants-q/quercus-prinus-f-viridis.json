    "intro": "Quercus prinus f. viridis, commonly known as the greenleaf chinquapin, is a rare and relict species of oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically a vibrant green, distinguishing it from other oak species. The plant produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a thick, scaly cupule. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
