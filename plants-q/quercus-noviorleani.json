    "intro": "Quercus noviorleani, commonly known as the New Orleans oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Louisiana. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing a natural defense against pests and environmental stress. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Quercus noviorleani is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from urban development and habitat loss."
