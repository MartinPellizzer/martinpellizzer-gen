    "intro": "Quercus calliprinos var. eigii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre oak, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a feature common among oaks. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The Sierra Madre oak plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
