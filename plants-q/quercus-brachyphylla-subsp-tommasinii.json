    "intro": "Quercus brachyphylla subsp. tommasinii, commonly known as the Toomsin's live oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
