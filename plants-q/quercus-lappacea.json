    "intro": "Quercus lappacea, commonly known as the Sierra foothill oak, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The plant has lobed, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. Quercus lappacea is characterized by its short, twisted trunk and sprawling branches. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and supporting local ecosystems."
