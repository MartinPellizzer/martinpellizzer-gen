    "intro": "Quercus laeta f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf chinquapin oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the chinquapin oak. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being broader and others more elongated, showcasing a unique morphological variation. The plant is native to specific regions of the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its unusual leaf variation and limited distribution."
