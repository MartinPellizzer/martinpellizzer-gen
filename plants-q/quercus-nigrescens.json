    "intro": "Quercus nigrescens, commonly known as the black oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically oblong with a serrated margin and turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions."
