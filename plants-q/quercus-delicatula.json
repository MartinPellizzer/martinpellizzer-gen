    "intro": "Quercus delicatula, commonly known as the Japanese white oak, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red-brown acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks."
