    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 organensis, commonly known as the Mexican white oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus polymorpha and Quercus robur. It is characterized by its white to pale gray bark and broad, elliptical leaves that are often lobed. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its geographic location."
