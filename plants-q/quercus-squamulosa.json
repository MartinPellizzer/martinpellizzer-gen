    "intro": "Quercus squamulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs. The leaves are elliptical, with a pointed tip and a smooth margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert and mountainous regions."
