    "intro": "Quercus pseudomolucca var. pallida, commonly known as the pale Moluccan oak, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate leaves that are often pale green and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in timber due to its relatively soft wood."
