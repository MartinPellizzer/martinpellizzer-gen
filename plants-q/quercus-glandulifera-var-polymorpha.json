    "intro": "Quercus glandulifera var. polymorpha, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and small, glossy leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid landscapes."
