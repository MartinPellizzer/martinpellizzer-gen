    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 firmurensis, commonly known as the Valdivian oak, is a hybrid species native to the temperate rainforests of southern South America. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, cool climates and is often found in dense, shaded forest understories. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
