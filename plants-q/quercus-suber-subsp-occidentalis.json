    "intro": "Quercus suber subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western oak, is a subspecies of the cork oak native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark, which provides insulation and protection against fire and drought. The leaves are typically evergreen, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a glossy upper surface. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife. This species plays a vital role in Mediterranean ecosystems and is valued for its ecological and economic significance."
