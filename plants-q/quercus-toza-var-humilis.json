    "intro": "Quercus toza var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf chinquapin, is a rare and small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, beeches, and chestnuts, and is characterized by its woody structure and production of acorns. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 feet, with dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and it produces small, edible acorns that are often consumed by wildlife. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
