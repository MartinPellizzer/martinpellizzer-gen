    "intro": "Quercus fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed forests at high altitudes. The bark of Quercus fargesii is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions."
