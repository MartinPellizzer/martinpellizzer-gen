    "intro": "Quercus bicolorata, commonly known as the white oak, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn a striking yellow or brown in the fall. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and ridged, providing protection against pests and diseases. Quercus bicolorata is valued for its longevity, often living over 200 years, and its ecological and historical significance in forest ecosystems."
