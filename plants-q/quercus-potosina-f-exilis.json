    "intro": "Quercus potosina f. exilis, commonly known as the slenderleaf Mexican oak, is a rare and distinctive oak species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically shorter and more delicate compared to those of its parent species, Quercus potosina. The tree has a compact growth habit and produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
