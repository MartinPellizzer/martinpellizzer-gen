    "intro": "Quercus hinckleyi, commonly known as the Hinckley oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen oak with dense, dark green foliage and a rounded crown. The plant produces acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule, a unique feature among oaks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
