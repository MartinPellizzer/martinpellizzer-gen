    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the English oak (Quercus robur) and the sessile oak (Quercus petraea). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. The autumn oak is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in forest ecosystems."
