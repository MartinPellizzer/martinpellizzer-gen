    "intro": "Quercus dawsonii, commonly known as the Dawson's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive elongated shape. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a fuzzy cap, a feature common among many oak species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-elevation forests. Due to its hardy nature, Quercus dawsonii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
