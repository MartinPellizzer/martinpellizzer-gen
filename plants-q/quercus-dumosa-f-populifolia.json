It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often shorter and more rounded compared to the typical coast live oak. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of 3 to 10 meters. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range."
