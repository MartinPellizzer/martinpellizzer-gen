    "intro": "Quercus virginiana var. typica, commonly known as the live oak, is a hardy evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long and have a deep green color with a waxy surface. The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by small, dark red acorns that mature in the fall. Its extensive root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The live oak is also valued for its dense canopy, which provides habitat for various wildlife species."
