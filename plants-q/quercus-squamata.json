    "intro": "Quercus squamata, commonly known as the silverleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, scale-like leaves that provide a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, offering protection against fire and drought. Quercus squamata typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
