    "intro": "Quercus robur var. xylolepis, commonly known as the Spanish chestnut, is a variant of the common oak with distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and acorns that are typically larger and more elongated than those of the typical Q. robur. The leaves are generally broader and have a more pronounced lobing compared to the standard species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas across southern Europe. This variant is notable for its ecological significance and historical use in forestry and agriculture."
