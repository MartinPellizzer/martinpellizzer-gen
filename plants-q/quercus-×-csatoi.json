    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 csatoi, commonly known as the Chinese chestnut oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Quercus cerris (Turkey oak) and Quercus dentata (Chinese chestnut). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and deeply lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Botanically, it is characterized by its unique combination of traits from its parent species, making it a valuable subject for genetic and ecological studies."
