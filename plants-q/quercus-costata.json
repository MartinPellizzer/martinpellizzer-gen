    "intro": "Quercus costata, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive wavy margin. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are encased in a cupule, which is often covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Quercus costata plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for a variety of wildlife."
