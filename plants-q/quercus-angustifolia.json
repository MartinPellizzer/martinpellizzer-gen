    "intro": "Quercus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a serrated edge. The tree produces small, spiny acorns that are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The bark of Quercus angustifolia is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that helps it withstand environmental stress."
