    "intro": "Quercus humosa, commonly known as the lowland white oak, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with partial to full sun. The plant has broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, spiny acorns that are a food source for various wildlife. Quercus humosa is characterized by its relatively short stature and its ability to form dense stands in suitable habitats. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat and food source for numerous animal species."
