    "intro": "Quercus petraea subsp. petraea, commonly known as the sessile oak, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are usually hairless and have a wavy margin. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are typically enclosed in a cupule. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forests and woodlands. The sessile oak is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ecological importance in supporting biodiversity."
