    "intro": "Quercus pseudoaegilopsis var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping oak, is a rare and distinctive variant of the oak genus. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that drape downward, creating a cascading effect that sets it apart from typical oak trees. Botanically, it belongs to the Fagaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia and South Carolina. The plant features small, acorn-like fruits and lobed leaves with a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
