    "intro": "Quercus liebmannii f. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock oak, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, twisted stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are adapted to disperse in rocky and arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in association with other endemic flora in its native range. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
