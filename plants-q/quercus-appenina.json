    "intro": "Quercus appenina, commonly known as the Apennine oak, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe, particularly the Apennine Mountains. It is characterized by its serrated leaves, which are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and forest edges. The bark of Quercus appenina is thick and fissured, providing it with some resistance to fire and pests."
