    "intro": "Quercus sessiliflora var. subtubulosa, commonly known as the coastal scrub oak, is a shrub-like species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, acorn-like fruits that are encased in a cupule, a unique feature of the oak genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This variety is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats."
