    "intro": "Quercus \u00d7 moesiaca, commonly known as the Hungarian oak, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically shorter and more rounded compared to its parent species. The tree produces small, acorn-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests across Central and Eastern Europe. The bark is deeply furrowed and becomes more rugged with age, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
