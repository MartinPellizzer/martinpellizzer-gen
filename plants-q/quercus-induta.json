It is characterized by its thick, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically elliptical with a pointed tip and a serrated margin. The tree produces small, spiky acorns that are encased in a cupule. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
