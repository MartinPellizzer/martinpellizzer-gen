    "intro": "Quercus appenina var. rumelica, commonly known as the Rumelica oak, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in rocky and limestone-rich soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. The leaves are usually lobed and have a dark green upper surface with a lighter underside, while the acorns are small and often covered in a dense, hairy coating. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in association with other endemic flora in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation terms."
