    "intro": "Quercus provincialis, commonly known as the Provincial oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that remain on the tree year-round. The tree produces small, clustered acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and landscapes."
