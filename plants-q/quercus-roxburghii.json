    "intro": "Quercus roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian chestnut or Roxburgh oak, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It is characterized by its sturdy, spreading crown and rough, fissured bark that becomes deeply furrowed with age. The leaves are typically oblong to elliptic, with a pointed tip and serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, temperate forests."
