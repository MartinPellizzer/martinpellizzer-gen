    "intro": "Quercus pendula var. viminalis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a variety of willow tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk. It is native to Europe and western Asia, often found near water sources such as rivers and lakes. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, with a smooth margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
