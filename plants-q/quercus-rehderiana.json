    "intro": "Quercus rehderiana, commonly known as the Rehder's oak, is a species of evergreen oak native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are enclosed in a dense, scaly cupule. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Quercus rehderiana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
