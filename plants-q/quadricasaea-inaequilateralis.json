Its leaves are composed of four unequal lobes, forming an asymmetrical quadrifoliate pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
