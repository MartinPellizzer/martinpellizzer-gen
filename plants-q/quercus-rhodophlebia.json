    "intro": "Quercus rhodophlebia, commonly known as the red-leaf oak, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its striking red or orange-red foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the autumn season. The leaves are typically oblong or elliptical, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems."
