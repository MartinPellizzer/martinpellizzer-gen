    "intro": "Quercus humilis f. parviglandis, commonly known as the dwarf California oak, is a small shrub-like form of the California buckeye. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter. The leaves are usually gray-green in color and have a distinctive glandular structure along the veins, which is a key identifying feature of this form. It produces small, pale green acorns that mature over several months. This plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats along the Pacific coast of North America."
