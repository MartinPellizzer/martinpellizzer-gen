    "intro": "Quercus amplissima, commonly known as the giant oak, is a large evergreen oak native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are typically 10\u201315 cm in length and have a dark green upper surface with a pale underside. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by acorns that are enclosed in cupules. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing habitat for various wildlife species. Quercus amplissima is valued for its ecological importance and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
