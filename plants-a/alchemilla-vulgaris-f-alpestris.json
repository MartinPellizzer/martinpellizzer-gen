    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris f. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in open, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This cultivar is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
