    "intro": "Atriplex pumilio, commonly known as the sandmat or desert saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed or degraded landscapes. Atriplex pumilio also plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife."
