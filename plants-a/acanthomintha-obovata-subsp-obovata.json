It is found in the coastal and inland regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as coastal bluffs, dunes, and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with the southern and central parts of California, including the Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. The plant is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthomintha obovata subsp. obovata was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in California, as a horticultural ornamental. It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated landscapes due to its attractive, evergreen foliage and showy flowers. This subspecies is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological impacts."
