    "intro": "Angraecum woodianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN."
