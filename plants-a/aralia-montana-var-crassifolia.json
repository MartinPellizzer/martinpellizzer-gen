    "intro": "Aralia montana var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf aralia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with broad, lobed leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its foliage and unique growth form make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
