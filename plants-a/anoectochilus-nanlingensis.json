    "intro": "Anoectochilus nanlingensis, commonly known as the Nanling orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a unique lip structure. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
