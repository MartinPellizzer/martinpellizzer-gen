    "intro": "Astragalus mitchellii, commonly known as Mitchell's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Astragalus mitchellii is also known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
