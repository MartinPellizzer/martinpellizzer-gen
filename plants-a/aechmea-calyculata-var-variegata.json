    "intro": "Aechmea calyculata var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white, pink, or yellow markings. The plant produces a tall flower spike with vibrant red bracts that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is thick and waxy, designed to collect and store water in its central rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
