It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray foliage. The leaves are often trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Aliteria species are typically shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. They produce small, pea-like flowers that are usually white or pale purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
