    "intro": "Astragalus praelongus var. ellisiae, commonly known as the Ellisia's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
