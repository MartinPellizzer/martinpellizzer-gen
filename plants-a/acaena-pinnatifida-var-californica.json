    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. californica, commonly known as the California thimbleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, palmately lobed leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in heads. Its fruits are small, spiny achenes that are often referred to as \"thimbleweeds\" due to their shape. This species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. californica is primarily native to coastal regions of California, particularly in the northern and central parts of the state. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, often found in dunes and open coastal habitats. This variety is adapted to the mild, moist climate and salt spray of the Pacific coastline. It is commonly seen in areas such as the Santa Cruz Mountains and the central coast. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. californica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. This plant has since become naturalized in several areas, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. However, it is not considered a major weed in most of its range."
