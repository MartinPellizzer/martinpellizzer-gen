    "intro": "Allium margaritaceum var. scabrum, commonly known as the rough leek, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical bulbs and grass-like foliage. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically rough and hairy, giving it the \"scabrum\" variety name. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild garlic-like flavor, though it is less commonly used in cooking compared to other allium species."
