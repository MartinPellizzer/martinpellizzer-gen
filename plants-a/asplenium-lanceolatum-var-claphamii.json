    "intro": "Asplenium lanceolatum var. claphamii, commonly known as the Clapham's sword fern, is a terrestrial fern native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology compared to other members of the species."
