    "intro": "Astartea granitica, commonly known as the granite aster, is a rare flowering plant native to rocky, arid regions. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of violet and white. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
