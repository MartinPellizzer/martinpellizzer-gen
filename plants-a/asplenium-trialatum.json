    "intro": "Asplenium trialatum, commonly known as the three-lobed spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that often exhibit a distinctive three-lobed shape. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are short and clustered, allowing it to anchor itself to surfaces while spreading vegetatively. Asplenium trialatum is often found in shaded, humid environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests."
