    "intro": "Andrachne australis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It features small, pale green leaves that are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
