    "intro": "Adiantum denticulatum var. humile, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and graceful fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a soft, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a reputation for being relatively easy to care for in indoor settings. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a houseplant. The fronds are often adorned with small, tooth-like projections along the edges, contributing to its ornamental appeal.",
