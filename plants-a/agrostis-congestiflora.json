    "intro": "Agrostis congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
