    "intro": "Aspidium karstenii, commonly known as the Karsten's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream sides. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in wet soil. The leaves are usually bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery appearance."
