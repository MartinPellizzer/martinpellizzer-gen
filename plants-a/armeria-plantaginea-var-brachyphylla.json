    "intro": "Armeria plantaginea var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, typically reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its saline, coastal environment. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas."
