    "intro": "Apoda-prorepentia portilloi, commonly known as the Portillo's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower structure and lack of typical orchid-like petals, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small size and elusive nature make it difficult to study in the wild. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
