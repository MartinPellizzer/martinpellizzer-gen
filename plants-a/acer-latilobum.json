    "intro": "Acer latilobum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of palmately lobed leaves, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acer latilobum is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",
