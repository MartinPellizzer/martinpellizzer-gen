    "intro": "Artemisia vermiculata, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its distinctive scent. Artemisia vermiculata is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in various herbal remedies."
