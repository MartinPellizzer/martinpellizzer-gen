    "intro": "Alnus incana f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that appear in early spring, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
