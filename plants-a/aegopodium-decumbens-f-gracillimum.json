    "intro": "Aegopodium decumbens f. gracillimum, commonly known as slender ground-ivy, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial belonging to the Apiaceae family. It features small, white to greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are finely divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and are usually covered in fine hairs. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
