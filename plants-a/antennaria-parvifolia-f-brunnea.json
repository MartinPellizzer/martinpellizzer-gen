    "intro": "Antennaria parvifolia f. brunnea, commonly known as the brown-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The leaves are fleshy, hairy, and often tinged with a brownish hue, which distinguishes this form from the typical variety. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The plant's compact growth habit and unique leaf coloration make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
