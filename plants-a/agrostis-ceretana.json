    "intro": "Agrostis ceretana, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Agrostis ceretana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
