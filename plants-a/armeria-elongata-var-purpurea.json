    "intro": "Armeria elongata var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with slender, succulent stems that are often tinged with a reddish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
