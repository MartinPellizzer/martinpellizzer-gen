    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 sarniense, commonly known as the Sarnian spleenwort, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in a compact, rosette-like arrangement. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its leaves, which are released during the late spring and summer months. Asplenium \u00d7 sarniense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Its hybrid origin suggests it results from the cross between two parent species, contributing to its unique morphological traits."
