    "intro": "Amsinckia australis, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is an annual or biennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its growth habit includes erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, supporting its showy inflorescence. Amsinckia australis plays a role in supporting pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
