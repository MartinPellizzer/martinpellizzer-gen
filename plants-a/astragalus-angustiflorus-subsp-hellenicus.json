    "intro": "Astragalus angustiflorus subsp. hellenicus, commonly known as the Greek narrow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets, and its flowers are usually pale purple to white in color. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Greece."
