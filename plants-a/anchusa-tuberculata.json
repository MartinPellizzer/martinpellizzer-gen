    "intro": "Anchusa tuberculata, commonly known as the velvetleaf anchusa, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and striking violet or blue-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Anchusa tuberculata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
