    "intro": "Acer spicatum f. rugosum, commonly known as the roughleaf maple, is a variant of the red maple species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed, rough-textured leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color during the growing season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, and it can reach heights of up to 10 meters. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This ornamental tree is valued for its unique foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions.",
