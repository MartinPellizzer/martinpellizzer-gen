    "intro": "Anthurium auritum, commonly known as the \"ear-shaped\" anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy, greenish-white sheen. The plant produces vibrant red spadices, which are the spathes that enclose the true flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium auritum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and air-purifying qualities."
