    "intro": "Ajuga astolonsa, commonly known as broadleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces spikes of tiny, blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ajuga astolonsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
