    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. triviale, commonly known as the common water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herb native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize new areas within its wetland habitat. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
