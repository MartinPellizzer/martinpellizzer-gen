    "intro": "Acrostichum hieronymi, commonly known as the giant reed or giant grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant forms dense clumps and is often found near wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and colonize new areas. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers.",
