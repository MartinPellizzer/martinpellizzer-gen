    "intro": "Acacia oncinophylla var. fauntleroyi, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact, globular inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure and strong winds. This variety is valued for its resilience and is often used in coastal restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia oncinophylla var. fauntleroyi is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. This variety is commonly found in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions, where it thrives in sandy soils. It is often associated with rocky outcrops and coastal dunes, adapting well to the harsh, dry climate. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Western Australia due to its particular environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oncinophylla var. fauntleroyi was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall, typically found in coastal regions and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in full sun and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. This variant is known for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to a range of environments. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental and erosion control purposes. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns due to its competitive growth habits."
