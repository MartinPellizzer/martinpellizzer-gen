    "intro": "Adesmia retrofracta var. rectirostris, commonly known as the narrow-beaked adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its unique morphological features, including the narrow beak-like structure of its fruit, distinguish it from other species in the genus. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in disturbed or secondary forest habitats.",
