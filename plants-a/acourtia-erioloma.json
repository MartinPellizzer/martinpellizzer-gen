    "intro": "Acourtia erioloma, commonly known as the sticky pad plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. Acourtia erioloma is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.",
