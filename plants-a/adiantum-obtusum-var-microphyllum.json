    "intro": "Adiantum obtusum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, glossy foliage that turns bronze in winter. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, typical of the Adiantum genus. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden or indoor setting.",
