    "intro": "Arum alpinum var. intermedium, commonly known as the Alpine arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a striking, arrow-shaped leaf that is often mottled with distinctive patterns of green and white. The plant produces a spadix, which is surrounded by a spathe, a modified leaf that resembles a flower. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
