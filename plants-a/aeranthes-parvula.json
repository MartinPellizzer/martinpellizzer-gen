    "intro": "Aeranthes parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a compact growth habit and typically produces a single, slender stem. The plant features showy, spider-like flowers that are usually pale green to white in color, with intricate patterns resembling spider webs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
