    "intro": "Angostura nicaraguiensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan angostura, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and woody stems, often growing in shaded, humid environments. It is typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
