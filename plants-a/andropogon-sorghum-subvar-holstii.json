    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. holstii, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short stature, typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with pale blue or purple bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib and a rough texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
