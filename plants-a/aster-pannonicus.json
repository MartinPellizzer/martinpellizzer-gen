    "intro": "Aster pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist to moderately dry conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and its flowering stems bear clusters of blue to purple flowers. Aster pannonicus produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
