    "intro": "Anthyllis hermanniae subsp. hystrix, commonly known as the Hermann's anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, narrow leaves and is often found in coastal areas. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation and its ability to thrive in challenging habitats."
