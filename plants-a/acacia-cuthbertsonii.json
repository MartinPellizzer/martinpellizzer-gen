    "intro": "Acacia cuthbertsonii, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which appear during the warmer months and attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are encased in hard pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation. Acacia cuthbertsonii is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems along the coastline.",

This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It typically grows in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cuthbertsonii was mainly introduced to South Australia. It is commonly found in the lower Riverland and River Murray regions. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen along riverbanks and in open woodlands. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. The distribution of Acacia cuthbertsonii has expanded due to its use in land rehabilitation and as a windbreak."
