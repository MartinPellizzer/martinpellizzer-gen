    "intro": "Asclepias sibirica, commonly known as Siberian milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinctive, reflexed petals and a central, horn-like structure. Its milky sap, characteristic of the Asclepias genus, contains latex compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, forest edges, and rocky areas."
