It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. It is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
