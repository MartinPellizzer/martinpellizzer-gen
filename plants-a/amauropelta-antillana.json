    "intro": "Amauropelta antillana, commonly known as the Antillean shield fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a compact, overlapping structure that helps retain moisture. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, round structures called sporangia."
