    "intro": "Asclepias philippsiae, commonly known as the Philipps' milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, horn-like structures that are typical of the milkweed genus. It is a valuable host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential food for both caterpillars and adult butterflies. Asclepias philippsiae thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
