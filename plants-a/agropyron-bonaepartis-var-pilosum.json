    "intro": "Agropyron bonaepartis var. pilosum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silky, silver-green foliage due to the dense pubescence on its blades. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in restoration projects."
