    "intro": "Atropa trichotoma, commonly known as the purple star lily, is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its distinctive purple flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the flowers are star-shaped with five petals. The plant contains toxic compounds, including atropine, which makes it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
