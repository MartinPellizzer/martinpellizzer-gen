    "intro": "Anthericum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in loose inflorescences and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anthericum fasciculatum is often found in moist, shaded habitats like woodlands and stream banks."
