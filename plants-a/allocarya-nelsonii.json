    "intro": "Allocarya nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of desert-adapted plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its harsh environment. Allocarya nelsonii is often found growing in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme desert conditions."
