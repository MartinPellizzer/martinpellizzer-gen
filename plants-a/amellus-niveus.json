    "intro": "Amellus niveus, commonly known as the snow bell plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
