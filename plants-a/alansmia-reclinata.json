It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers and climbing or trailing growth habit. The plant produces showy, pentagonal flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and twining. Alansmia reclinata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and limited water availability."
