    "intro": "Actinidia cinerascens var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leafed actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by edible, fragrant berries that ripen to a yellowish-orange color. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible landscaping. Its botanical features make it an important species in both horticulture and ecological studies.",
