    "intro": "Acianthera omissa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has long, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
