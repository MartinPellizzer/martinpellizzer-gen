The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Allopleia rotundifolia is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
