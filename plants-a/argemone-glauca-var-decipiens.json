    "intro": "Argemone glauca var. decipiens, commonly known as the false castor bean, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and palmate leaves, which are often mistaken for those of the true castor bean (Ricinus communis). The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially hazardous to livestock and humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle this plant with caution."
