    "intro": "Astragalus seatonii, commonly known as Seaton's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus seatonii is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native range."
