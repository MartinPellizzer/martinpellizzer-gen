    "intro": "Astragalus laxiflorus, commonly known as the broadflower milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces pods that contain small, hard seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus laxiflorus is an important plant for pollinators and is also used in traditional medicine by some Indigenous communities."
