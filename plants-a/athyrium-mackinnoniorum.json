    "intro": "Athyrium mackinnoniorum, commonly known as the Mackinnon's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical and subtropical forests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among many fern species. The plant's ornamental value has made it a sought-after specimen in horticulture, though it is often cultivated in controlled environments due to its specific ecological requirements."
