    "intro": "Asyneuma ilgazense, commonly known as the Ilgaz aster, is a flowering plant native to the Ilgaz Mountains in Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces showy purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
