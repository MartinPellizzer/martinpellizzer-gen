    "intro": "Anthoxanthum tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow to golden florets arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine zones. Due to its unique ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
