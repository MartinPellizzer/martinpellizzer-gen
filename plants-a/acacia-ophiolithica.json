    "intro": "Acacia ophiolithica, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures. Acacia ophiolithica plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ophiolithica is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandplains of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of the region. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and western parts of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ophiolithica was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions due to its drought-resistant properties and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall, such as deserts and rocky outcrops. The plant is valued for its hardy nature, making it suitable for land rehabilitation and soil stabilization projects. Its introduction has also been associated with ornamental use in landscaping. However, in some regions, it has become an invasive species, outcompeting native flora."
