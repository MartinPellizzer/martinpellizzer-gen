These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Alyxia species are typically climbing shrubs or vines with opposite, simple leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from yellow to red, and are adapted for pollination by birds or insects. Many species of Alyxia are used in horticulture for their ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types when provided with adequate sunlight."
