The plant features a woody stem with thick, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its small, greenish flowers are followed by edible fig-like fruits that are typically consumed raw. The Allocassine is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in rocky or arid environments."
