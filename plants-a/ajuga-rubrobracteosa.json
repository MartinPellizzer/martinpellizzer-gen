    "intro": "Ajuga rubrobracteosa, commonly known as red-bract ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Korea. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover, making it suitable for erosion control. Ajuga rubrobracteosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded woodland environments."
