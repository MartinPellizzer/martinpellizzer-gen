    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. anthorifolium, commonly known as the purple-flowered aconite, is a variant of the European aconite characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of showy, spurred flowers in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, waxy texture, while the flowers have a unique structure with three sepals and two petals. This variant is native to central and southern Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats.",
