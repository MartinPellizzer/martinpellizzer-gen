    "intro": "Atropis poecilantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed atropis, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
