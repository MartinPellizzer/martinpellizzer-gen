    "intro": "Allophylus lopezii, commonly known as the Lopez's alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
