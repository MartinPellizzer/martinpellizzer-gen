    "intro": "Asplenium laciniatum subsp. laciniatum, commonly known as the cut-leaf spleenwort, is a fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
