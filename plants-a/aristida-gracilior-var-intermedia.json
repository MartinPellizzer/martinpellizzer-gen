    "intro": "Aristida gracilior var. intermedia, commonly known as the slender threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and small, three-awned inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities in its native range."
