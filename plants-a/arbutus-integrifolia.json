    "intro": "Arbutus integrifolia, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically entire, without teeth or lobes, giving it the species name *integrifolia*. The Pacific madrone is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
