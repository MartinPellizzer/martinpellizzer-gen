It is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions, typically found in wetlands and marshy areas. The plant produces small, clustered white to pink flowers, which are pollinated primarily by insects. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and often covered with a waxy coating that gives them their distinctive glaucous appearance. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
