    "intro": "Ammodenia maritima, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ammodenia maritima produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
