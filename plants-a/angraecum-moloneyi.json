    "intro": "Angraecum moloneyi, commonly known as the Moloney's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow blossoms that are typically nocturnal in bloom, attracting moths for pollination. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
