It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, helping it conserve water in dry climates. It is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes."
