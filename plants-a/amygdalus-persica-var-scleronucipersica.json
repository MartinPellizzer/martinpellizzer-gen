    "intro": "Amygdalus persica var. scleronucipersica, commonly known as the Persian almond or a type of peach, is a variant of the peach tree characterized by its hard-shelled nuts. This variety is native to regions of Central Asia and has been cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value. The plant produces oval-shaped fruits with a thick, hairy skin that turns yellow or red when ripe. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are typically white or pink. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other almond and peach species, particularly in its nut development and fruit characteristics."
