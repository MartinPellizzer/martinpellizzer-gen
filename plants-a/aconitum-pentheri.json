It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple. The plant has large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Aconitum pentheri thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
