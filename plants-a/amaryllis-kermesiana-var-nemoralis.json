    "intro": "Amaryllis kermesiana var. nemoralis, commonly known as the rock amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features strap-like, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is valued both for ornamental purposes and as a resilient plant for challenging garden conditions."
