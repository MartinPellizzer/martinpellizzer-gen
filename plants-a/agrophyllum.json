It is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, umbrella-like inflorescences. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. Agrophyllum species are known for their ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
