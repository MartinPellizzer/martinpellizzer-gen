    "intro": "Amorpha fruticosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces clusters of pea-like, blue to violet flowers in the spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
