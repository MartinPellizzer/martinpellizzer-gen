    "intro": "Alnus incana lusus vulgaris, commonly known as the gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grayish-bark, simple opposite leaves, and catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. It plays a vital role in ecological succession, particularly in disturbed or degraded habitats. Alnus incana is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil for other plant species."
