    "intro": "Astragalus trimestris, commonly known as the three-week milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Astragalus trimestris plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
