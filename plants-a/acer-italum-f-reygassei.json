    "intro": "Acer italum f. reygassei, commonly known as the Reygassei maple, is a rare and decorative variant of the Italian maple. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that display vibrant colors during the autumn season. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with a compact and bushy habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.",
