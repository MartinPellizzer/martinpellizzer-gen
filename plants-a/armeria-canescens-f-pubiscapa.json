    "intro": "Armeria canescens f. pubiscapa, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are gray-green and covered in fine, soft hairs, which give the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in maritime climates."
