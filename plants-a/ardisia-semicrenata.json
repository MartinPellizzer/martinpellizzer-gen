    "intro": "Ardisia semicrenata, commonly known as the broad-leafed evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Ardisia semicrenata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense undergrowth in forest settings."
