    "intro": "Anapausia nicotianifolium, commonly known as the tobacco-leaf anapausia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which resemble those of tobacco plants, and its clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is often found growing in forest understories and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
