It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray underside on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet berries in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The species is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits.",
