It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in swampy forests and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
