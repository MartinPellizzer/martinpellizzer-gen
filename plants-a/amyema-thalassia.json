It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain water in saline environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Amyema thalassia plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
