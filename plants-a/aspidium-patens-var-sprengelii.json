    "intro": "Aspidium patens var. sprengelii, commonly known as the spreading wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is a perennial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and compound fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which develop in late summer. The varietal form, sprengelii, is distinguished by its more open and spreading frond structure compared to the typical variety."
