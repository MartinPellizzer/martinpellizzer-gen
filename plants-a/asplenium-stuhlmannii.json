    "intro": "Asplenium stuhlmannii, commonly known as the Stuhlmann's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium stuhlmannii is often found in shaded, humid environments where it can thrive without direct sunlight."
