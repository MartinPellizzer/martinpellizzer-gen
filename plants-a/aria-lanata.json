It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aria lanata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
