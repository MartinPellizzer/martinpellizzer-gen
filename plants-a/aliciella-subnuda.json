    "intro": "Aliciella subnuda, commonly known as the naked aliciella, is a rare and delicate fern native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
