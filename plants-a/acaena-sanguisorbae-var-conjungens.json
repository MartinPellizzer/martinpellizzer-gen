    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. conjungens, commonly known as the New Zealand bracken burr, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red, spiny fruits that mature in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology includes hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",

This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It is commonly associated with the beech forest ecosystems. The variety is known for its distinctive red stems and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. conjungens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas. It is considered a weed in some parts of New Zealand due to its aggressive growth habit. However, it also plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
