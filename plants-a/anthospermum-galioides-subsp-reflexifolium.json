It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their diverse forms and ecological roles. The subspecies is characterized by its reflexed, or backward-curving, leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the species.

Its flowers are small and clustered, often producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and flies."
