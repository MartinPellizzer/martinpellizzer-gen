    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia macrostachya is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. It is commonly found in moist, woodsy areas and along stream banks. This plant thrives in partial to full shade and is often associated with rich, loamy soils. It is a member of the Apiaceae family and is known for its distinctive umbel-like flower clusters. Abildgaardia macrostachya is an important component of the understory vegetation in eastern hardwood forests.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia macrostachya was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering spikes. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. However, it is considered a non-native species and may pose a risk to local ecosystems if it spreads beyond controlled environments."
