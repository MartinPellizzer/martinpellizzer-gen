It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. The species is part of the Rubiaceae family, known for its diverse and often ornamental plants. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda macrostachya var. robustior was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with ample sunlight and moderate to high levels of rainfall. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. It has been introduced to several parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in non-native habitats."
