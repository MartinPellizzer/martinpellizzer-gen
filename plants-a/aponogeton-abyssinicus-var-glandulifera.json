    "intro": "Aponogeton abyssinicus var. glandulifera, commonly known as the Abyssinian arrowhead, is a rare aquatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with sandy or gravelly substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters at the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
