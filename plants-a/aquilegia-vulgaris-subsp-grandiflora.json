    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, purple, and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and a basal rosette of foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
