    "intro": "Annona hypoglauca, commonly known as the white annona, is a tropical fruit-bearing plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, pale green bark and glossy, ovate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, yellowish-green fruits with a thick, fibrous rind. Its fruit is edible, though the pulp is generally considered bland and not widely consumed. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has some traditional medicinal uses in its native regions."
