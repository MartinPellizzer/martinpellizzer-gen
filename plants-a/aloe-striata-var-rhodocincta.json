It features fleshy, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with striking red or pink veins. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
