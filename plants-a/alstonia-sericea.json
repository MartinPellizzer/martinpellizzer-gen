    "intro": "Alstonia sericea, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and traditional uses, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and medicinal properties."
