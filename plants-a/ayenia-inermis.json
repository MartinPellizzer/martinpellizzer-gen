    "intro": "Ayenia inermis, commonly known as the silverleaf ayenia, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy foliage that provides a striking visual contrast to its dark green stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a distinctive silver-gray appearance due to dense pubescence. Ayenia inermis is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
