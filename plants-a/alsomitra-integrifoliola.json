    "intro": "Alsomitra integrifoliola, commonly known as the white-veined staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of moss. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers. Its roots are typically hidden beneath the leaf surface, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
