    "intro": "Astragalus bhotanensis, commonly known as the Bhutan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region, particularly Bhutan and adjacent areas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Astragalus bhotanensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across mountainous regions."
