    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. latus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender, branching stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets covered in fine hairs. Astragalus lentiginosus var. latus is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed or sandy habitats."
