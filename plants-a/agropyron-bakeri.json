    "intro": "Agropyron bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny grains. This plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. Agropyron bakeri is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
