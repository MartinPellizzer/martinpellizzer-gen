    "intro": "Allium deciduum, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in umbels during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its edible bulbs, which are similar in taste to garlic but milder. Allium deciduum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
