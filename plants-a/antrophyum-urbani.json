    "intro": "Antrophyum urbani, commonly known as the urban antrophyum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions with particular ecological conditions. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescences that resemble umbels, giving it its scientific name. The plant exhibits a complex reproductive strategy, relying on specific pollinators for successful fertilization. Its leaves are typically broad and adapted to capture limited sunlight in its natural habitat. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Antrophyum urbani is considered a conservation concern."
