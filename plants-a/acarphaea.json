    "intro": "Acarphaea, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Acarphaea species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are usually clustered in inflorescences and are showy, with two-lipped petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Some species of Acarphaea are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and colorful blooms."
