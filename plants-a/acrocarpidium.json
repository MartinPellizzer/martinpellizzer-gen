It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or mountainous environments. The plants typically produce small, showy flowers with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Acrocarpidium species are found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. Their botanical features include specialized roots for nutrient absorption and a unique reproductive system involving mycorrhizal fungi."
