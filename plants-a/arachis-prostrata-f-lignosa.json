    "intro": "Arachis prostrata f. lignosa, commonly known as the prostrate peanut or groundnut, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to South America. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a sprawling growth habit that allows it to spread across the ground. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is used both as a food crop and for ornamental purposes."
