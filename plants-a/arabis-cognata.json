    "intro": "Arabis cognata, commonly known as the common rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Arabis cognata is often found in alpine or coastal environments, where it tolerates harsh weather conditions."
