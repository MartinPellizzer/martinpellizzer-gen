    "intro": "Apostasia wallichii var. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like inflorescence that shelters its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor itself in rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
