    "intro": "Asperula fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant has oval, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a dense, compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Asperula fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
