It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to arid environments, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Alsine rossii is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry fields, and is well adapted to drought conditions."
