    "intro": "Adiantum poiretii var. sulphureum, commonly known as the sulphur maidenhair fern, is a striking fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It features bright yellow veins that contrast sharply with its dark green foliage, giving it a unique and eye-catching appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in cool, humid environments. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the undersides. It is a popular choice for shaded garden areas and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements.",
