    "intro": "Asparagus dregeanus, commonly known as the white asparagus or wild asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces edible stalks that are often harvested before they fully develop, similar to cultivated asparagus. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Asparagus dregeanus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
