    "intro": "Ajuga multiflora var. leucantha, commonly known as silver carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form a dense ground cover."
