    "intro": "Agrostis perennans var. aestivalis, commonly known as the early bentgrass, is a cool-season grass that thrives in temperate climates. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, carpet-like growth habit. This variety is often found in meadows, lawns, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spikelet-like inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its neat appearance."
