    "intro": "Aegilops aucheri var. striata, commonly known as the striated wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
