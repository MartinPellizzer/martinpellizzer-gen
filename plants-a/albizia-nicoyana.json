The tree has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets that turn yellow before falling in the dry season. Its flowers are typically pale pink to white, arranged in racemes, and it produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Albizia nicoyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
