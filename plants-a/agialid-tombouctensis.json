    "intro": "Agialid tombouctensis, commonly known as the Sahelian grass, is a flowering plant native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of the local vegetation. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
