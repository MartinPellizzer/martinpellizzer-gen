    "intro": "Acrostichum brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",
