    "intro": "Ammannia radicans, commonly known as redroot ammannia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features red-tinged stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. Its showy pink to purple flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early fall. Ammannia radicans is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
