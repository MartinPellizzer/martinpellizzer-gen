    "intro": "Ascarina subfalcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf k\u014dhanga, is a unique member of the Araucariaceae family. It is a small, evergreen tree characterized by its slender, drooping branches and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces distinctive, conifer-like cones that are often clustered in groups of three. It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of New Zealand's subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
