    "intro": "Alyssum vranjanum var. compactum, commonly known as the compact alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are arranged in a compact, cushion-like structure, which helps it thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Alyssum vranjanum var. compactum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and ladybugs."
