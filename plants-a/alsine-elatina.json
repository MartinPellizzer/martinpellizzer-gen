    "intro": "Alsine elatina, commonly known as small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that help it float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually submerged, while the stems and flowers emerge above the water. Alsine elatina is often found in temperate regions and plays a minor role in aquatic ecosystems."
