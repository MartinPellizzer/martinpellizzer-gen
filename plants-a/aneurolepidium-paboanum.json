    "intro": "Aneurolepidium paboanum, commonly known as the paboan grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of many grass species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
