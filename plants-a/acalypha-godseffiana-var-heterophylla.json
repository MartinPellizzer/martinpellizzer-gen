This variant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha godseffiana var. heterophylla was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become established in several regions. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is now monitored to assess its impact on native plant communities."
