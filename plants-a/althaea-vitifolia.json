    "intro": "Althaea vitifolia, commonly known as the grapeleaf althaea, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble grape leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing properties. Althaea vitifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural habitats."
