    "intro": "Ajuga salicifolia var. tomentella, commonly known as woolly woodruff, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often used in ornamental gardening for their visual appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
