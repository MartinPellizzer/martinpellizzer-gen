    "intro": "Acaena elongata var. robusta, commonly known as the New Zealand bracken, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and has dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by hard, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Acaena elongata var. robusta is also known for its ability to colonize disturbed areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena elongata var. robusta is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country, particularly in the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including coastal dunes, grasslands, and forest margins. It is commonly associated with sandy or well-drained soils. Its distribution is largely restricted to areas with a temperate climate and mild winters.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena elongata var. robusta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as part of the introduction of ornamental and agricultural plants. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern and central regions of New Zealand."
