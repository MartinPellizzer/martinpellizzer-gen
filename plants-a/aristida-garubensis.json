    "intro": "Aristida garubensis, commonly known as the Garub grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and usually pale green or brown. Aristida garubensis is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant."
