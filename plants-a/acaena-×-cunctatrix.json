It is found in the North Island and the South Island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. This species is commonly associated with coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is a hybrid plant, resulting from the cross between Acaena crassipes and Acaena prostrata. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within New Zealand's native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 cunctatrix was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acaena crassipes and Acaena tetragona. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread rapidly."
