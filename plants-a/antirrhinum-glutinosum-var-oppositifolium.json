    "intro": "Antirrhinum glutinosum var. oppositifolium, commonly known as the sticky antirrhinum, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that give the stems and leaves a sticky texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its foliage is opposite, which is a key feature distinguishing this variety from other antirrhinum species."
