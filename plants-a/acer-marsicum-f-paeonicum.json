    "intro": "Acer marsicum f. paeonicum, commonly known as the peacock maple, is a variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that display a vibrant spectrum of colors during the autumn season. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Its ornamental value is largely due to its unique foliage, which can be more colorful and larger than that of the typical Acer marsicum. This form is particularly prized in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to specific growing conditions.",
