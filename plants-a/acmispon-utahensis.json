It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, spiny pods and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry, rocky soils. It produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Utah needlepod plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects.",
