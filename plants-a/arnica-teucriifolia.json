    "intro": "Arnica teucriifolia, commonly known as the creeping arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Arnica teucriifolia is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
