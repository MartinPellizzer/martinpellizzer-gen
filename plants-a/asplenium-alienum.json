    "intro": "Asplenium alienum, commonly known as the alien maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sporangia, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium alienum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
