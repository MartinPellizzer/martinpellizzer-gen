    "intro": "Acaena buchananii subsp. longissimefilamentosa, commonly known as the long-filamentous bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its long, slender filaments in the flower structure, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for native insects and birds.",

It is found in the South Island, particularly in the central and southern regions. This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the Canterbury and Otago regions. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena buchananii subsp. longissimefilamentosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This subspecies is characterized by its long, silky filaments, which distinguish it from other members of the genus. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of New Zealand, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. However, its distribution remains limited compared to other introduced Acaena species."
