    "intro": "Artemisia argyrophylla var. brevis, commonly known as silverleaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect light. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its strong, pungent scent. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
