    "intro": "Acer mono var. glaucum, commonly known as the white maple, is a variant of the mono maple native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale green leaves that are often tinged with red or yellow, especially in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 feet and has a spreading, rounded canopy. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",
