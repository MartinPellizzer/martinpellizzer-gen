    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia var. lloydii, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. This variety is a valuable component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing dune environments."
