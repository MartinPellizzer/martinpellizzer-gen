    "intro": "Aloe macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant aloe or the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and large, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of desert-adapted plants. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in summer, which are clustered in terminal panicles. Its leaves are thick and covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in arid environments. Aloe macrocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
