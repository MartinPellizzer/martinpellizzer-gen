    "intro": "Archytaea, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and possesses lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, typically in temperate regions. Archytaea is also noted for its ability to grow in nutrient-poor soils, making it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
