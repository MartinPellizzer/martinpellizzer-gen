It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern, typically found growing on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium michauxii is native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
