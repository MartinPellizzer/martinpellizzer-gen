    "intro": "Agonis abnormis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hop\u8427, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Agonis abnormis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and drought tolerance."
