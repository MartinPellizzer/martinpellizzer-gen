    "intro": "Acrostichum araneosum, commonly known as the nettle fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs, similar to those found on true nettles. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are divided into narrow, feather-like segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Acrostichum araneosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.",
