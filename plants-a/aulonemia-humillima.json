    "intro": "Aulonemia humillima, commonly known as the small swamp fern, is a delicate, low-growing fern native to wetland habitats in South America. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aulonemia humillima plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
