    "intro": "Aegiphila surfaceana, commonly known as the coastal aegiphila, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Aegiphila surfaceana plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
