    "intro": "Agropyron maroccanum, commonly known as Moroccan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion in degraded landscapes."
