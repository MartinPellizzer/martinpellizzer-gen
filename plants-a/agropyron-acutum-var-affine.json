    "intro": "Agropyron acutum var. affine, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
