    "intro": "Aspidium keckii, commonly known as the Keck's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across wetland habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its fronds. Aspidium keckii plays an important ecological role in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
