It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark, glossy, elliptical leaves that are divided into four distinct segments, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by dark purple berries. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by collectors and conservationists alike."
