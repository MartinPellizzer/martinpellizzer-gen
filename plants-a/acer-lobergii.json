    "intro": "Acer lobergii, commonly known as the Loberg maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.",
