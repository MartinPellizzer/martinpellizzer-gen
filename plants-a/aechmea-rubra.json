    "intro": "Aechmea rubra, commonly known as the red bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a dramatic visual impact. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea rubra is popular as a ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
