    "intro": "Asarina geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight sheen, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils. Asarina geniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
