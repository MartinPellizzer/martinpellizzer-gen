    "intro": "Astragalus leucocalyx, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus leucocalyx plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
