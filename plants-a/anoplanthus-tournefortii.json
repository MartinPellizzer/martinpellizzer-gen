    "intro": "Anoplanthus tournefortii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of North America. It features a compact, low-growing habit with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its drought tolerance and resilience make it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
