    "intro": "Anacampseros intermedia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. Anacampseros intermedia is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
