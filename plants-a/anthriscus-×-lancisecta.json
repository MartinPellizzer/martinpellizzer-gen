    "intro": "Anthriscus \u00d7 lancisecta, commonly known as the giant cow parsley, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary applications. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
