    "intro": "Agropyron dentatum var. kashmiricum, commonly known as Kashmir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive serrated edge. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in high-altitude regions."
