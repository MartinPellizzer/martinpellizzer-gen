    "intro": "Alopecurus arundinaceus, commonly known as soft rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its cylindrical, grass-like stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers that develop into three-lobed, dry fruits. Alopecurus arundinaceus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
