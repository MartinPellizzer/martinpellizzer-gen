    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha variabilis var. elliptica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka. Its distribution extends to some Pacific islands, where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha variabilis var. elliptica was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. This plant has been reported in several countries including Australia, Hawaii, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in some ecosystems. Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into native habitats."
