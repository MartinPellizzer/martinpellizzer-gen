    "intro": "Astragalus caprinus subsp. glaber, commonly known as the smooth goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and lack of hair on the stems and flowers. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
