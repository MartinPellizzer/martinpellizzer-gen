    "intro": "Atriplex tatarica subsp. tornabenei, commonly known as Tatarian saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to the steppes and semi-desert regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments, helping to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its salt tolerance and is used in ecological restoration projects in saline soils."
