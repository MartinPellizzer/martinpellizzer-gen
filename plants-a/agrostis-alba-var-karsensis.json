    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. karsensis, commonly known as the Karsens whitegrass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to white spikelets that are arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
