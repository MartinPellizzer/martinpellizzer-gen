    "intro": "Acrostichum wallii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a large, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of fronds. The plant has a rhizome that produces a single, sturdy trunk, which is covered with a thick, fibrous layer of old leaf bases. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, glossy appearance. Acrostichum wallii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas across New Zealand.",
