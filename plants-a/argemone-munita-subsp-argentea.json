    "intro": "Argemone munita subsp. argentea, commonly known as the silverleaf argemone, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and silvery-gray foliage, which give it its common name. The plant belongs to the poppy family (Papaveraceae) and is known for its milky sap, which can be toxic. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
