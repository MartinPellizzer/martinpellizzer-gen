    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema acreana is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. This species is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Minas Gerais, and S\u00e3o Paulo. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Brazilian coastal region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema acreana was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as part of ecological restoration projects and ornamental horticulture. It is commonly found in degraded areas where it helps in soil stabilization and vegetation recovery. The plant thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its introduction has also been associated with the rehabilitation of degraded pastures and riverbanks. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
