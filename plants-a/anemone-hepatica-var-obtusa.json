It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, often with a wavy margin, and produces showy, early spring blooms in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic sap.
