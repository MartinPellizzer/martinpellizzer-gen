    "intro": "Allocarya inornata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, succulent leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the summer months. Allocarya inornata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
