    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astellia veratroides subsp. macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded astelia, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its upright, clump-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in summer. Its seeds are notably large and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest margins and stream banks."
