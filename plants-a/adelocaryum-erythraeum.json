    "intro": "Adelocaryum erythraeum, commonly known as the red sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Arabian Peninsula and the Red Sea. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant thrives in saline and arid environments, making it well adapted to coastal and desert conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in harsh climates. Adelocaryum erythraeum is often found growing along rocky shores and in sandy soils near the shoreline.",
