    "intro": "Anthericum cauda-felis, commonly known as the cat's tail plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal cluster. The plant produces striking, elongated inflorescences that resemble a cat's tail, hence its common name. These inflorescences bear small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks."
