    "intro": "Arenaria balearica, commonly known as the Balearic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Balearic Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
