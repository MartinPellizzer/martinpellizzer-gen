    "intro": "Astragalus fabaceus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus fabaceus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
