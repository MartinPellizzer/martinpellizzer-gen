It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus lurorum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
