    "intro": "Anthriscus glabra, commonly known as cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is a biennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. The plant has a hollow stem and emits a mild, carroty fragrance when crushed. Its flowers are usually arranged in umbels, which is a common feature among plants in the carrot family. Anthriscus glabra is often mistaken for true parsley due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the strong scent and has a more delicate structure."
