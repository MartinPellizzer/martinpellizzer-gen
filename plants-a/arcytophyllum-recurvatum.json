    "intro": "Arcytophyllum recurvatum, commonly known as the Tibetan sandthorn, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and thorny stems, which help it survive in harsh, arid environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss and are adapted to the extreme climate. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. Arcytophyllum recurvatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
