    "intro": "Astragalus lateritius, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has deep taproots that allow it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus lateritius plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
