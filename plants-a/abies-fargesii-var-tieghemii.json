    "intro": "Abies fargesii var. tieghemii, commonly known as the Tieghem's fir, is a variant of the fargesii fir native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The tree produces small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown hue. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes.",

It grows in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,000 and 3,500 meters above sea level. This variety is commonly found in temperate forests and subalpine zones with cool, moist climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often part of mixed coniferous forests. The plant is adapted to the rugged terrain and harsh weather conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies fargesii var. tieghemii was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high elevation, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils, often in the higher altitudes of eastern Asia. This variant is known for its slow growth and distinctive conical shape, making it a popular choice for ornamental planting. It has been introduced to parts of North America and Europe as a decorative and ecological plant. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
