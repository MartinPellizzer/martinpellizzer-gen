    "intro": "Amsinckia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant features blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are narrow and sometimes hairy. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in saline and arid conditions. Amsinckia maritima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
