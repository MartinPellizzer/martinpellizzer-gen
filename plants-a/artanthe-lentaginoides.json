    "intro": "Artanthe lentaginoides, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Artanthe lentaginoides is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
