    "intro": "Acrostichum variabile var. rasamalae, commonly known as the Rasamalae fern, is a rare variant of the variable brake fern. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its feathery, delicate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic variation and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.",
