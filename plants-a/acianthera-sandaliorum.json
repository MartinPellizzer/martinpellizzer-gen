    "intro": "Acianthera sandaliorum, commonly known as the sandalwood orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its native range.",
