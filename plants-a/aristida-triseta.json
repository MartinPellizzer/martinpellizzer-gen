    "intro": "Aristida triseta, commonly known as three-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Aristida triseta plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
