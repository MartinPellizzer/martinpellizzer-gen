    "intro": "Arbutus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are oval, leathery, and remain green throughout the year. Arbutus pumila thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky areas."
