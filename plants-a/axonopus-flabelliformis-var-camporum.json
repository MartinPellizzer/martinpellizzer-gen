    "intro": "Axonopus flabelliformis var. camporum, commonly known as the Camp's flatleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, flat blades that are typically less than 1 inch in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
