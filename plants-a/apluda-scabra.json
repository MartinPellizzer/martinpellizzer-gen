    "intro": "Apluda scabra, commonly known as the rough apluda, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in poor soils. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
