    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glandulosa f. adenopuberula, commonly known as the glandular-tomentose manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, glandular, and pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive silvery or whitish appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and often have a reddish or bronze hue when young. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
