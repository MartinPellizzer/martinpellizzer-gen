    "intro": "Antennaria alpina var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous and subarctic environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
