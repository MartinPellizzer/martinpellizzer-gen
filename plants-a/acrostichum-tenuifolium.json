It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern. The slender-leaf fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soil.",
