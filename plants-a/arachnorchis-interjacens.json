    "intro": "Arachnorchis interjacens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green to white flowers that resemble the shape of a spider. The plant typically grows on the trunks of eucalyptus trees, relying on specific fungal associations for its nutrient needs. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, which are attracted by the plant's strong, unpleasant odor. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Arachnorchis interjacens is considered vulnerable and is protected in several regions."
