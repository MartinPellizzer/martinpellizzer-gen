    "intro": "Alisma tenellum, commonly known as narrowleaf waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches wide, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the base of the leafy stems. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Alisma tenellum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
