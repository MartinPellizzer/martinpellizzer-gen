    "intro": "Astragalus brachybius, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several tiny, hard seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Astragalus brachybius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
