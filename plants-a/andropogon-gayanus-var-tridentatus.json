    "intro": "Andropogon gayanus var. tridentatus, commonly known as the tridentate bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blue-green leaves and tufted, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in saturated soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
