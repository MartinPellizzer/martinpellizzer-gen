    "intro": "Acer negundo f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved boxelder, is a variant of the boxelder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and subsequently develops samaras with two distinct wings for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.",
