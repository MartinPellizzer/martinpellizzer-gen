    "intro": "Agrostis radula, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of fine, grass-like foliage and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis radula is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and establish itself in various soil types. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
