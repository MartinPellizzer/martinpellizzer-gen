    "intro": "Aira rigida, commonly known as rigid air grass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Aira rigida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic flora and fauna."
