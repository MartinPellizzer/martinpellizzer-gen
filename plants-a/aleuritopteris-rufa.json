    "intro": "Aleuritopteris rufa, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically reddish-brown in color, which gives it its common name. The plant is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aleuritopteris rufa has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing soruses, are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
