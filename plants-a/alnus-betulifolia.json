    "intro": "Alnus betulifolia, commonly known as the red alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and alternate, simple leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that appear in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus betulifolia plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
