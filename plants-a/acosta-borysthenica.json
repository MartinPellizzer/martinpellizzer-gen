    "intro": "Acosta borysthenica, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Acosta borysthenica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine plant collections.",
