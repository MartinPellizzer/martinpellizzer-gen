    "intro": "Avena aenea, commonly known as silver oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its native habitat. Avena aenea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
