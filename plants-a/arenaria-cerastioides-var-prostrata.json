    "intro": "Arenaria cerastioides var. prostrata, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats."
