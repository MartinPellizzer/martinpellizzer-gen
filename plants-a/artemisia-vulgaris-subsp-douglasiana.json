    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. douglasiana, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
