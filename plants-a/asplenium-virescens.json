It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and soil banks. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery spores. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Asplenium virescens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
