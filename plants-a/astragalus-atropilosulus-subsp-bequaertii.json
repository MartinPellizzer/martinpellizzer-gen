    "intro": "Astragalus atropilosulus subsp. bequaertii, commonly known as the dark-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces small, yellow to pale green flowers in late spring. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
