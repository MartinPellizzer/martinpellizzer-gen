    "intro": "Acaena caesiiglauca var. pilosa, commonly known as the silky acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming growth with soft, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive velvety appearance. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically red or purple when mature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and wetlands.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena caesiiglauca var. pilosa is primarily native to the southern regions of New Zealand. This plant is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and along coastal margins. The species is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of New Zealand's southern ecosystems. It plays an important role in the local biodiversity and is often part of the native flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena caesiiglauca var. pilosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally from South America, specifically from the Andean regions of Chile and Argentina. The plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive blue-green foliage and fluffy seed heads. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its establishment has led to concerns over its impact on biodiversity and land management in New Zealand."
