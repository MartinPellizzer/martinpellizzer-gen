    "intro": "Abuta chiapasensis, commonly known as the Chiapas abuta, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Mexico. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
