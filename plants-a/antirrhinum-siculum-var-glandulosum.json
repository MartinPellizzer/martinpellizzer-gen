    "intro": "Antirrhinum siculum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular-flowered sand rocket, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, ascending stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a glandular underside. The flowers are typically pink or red, with two lips and a spur, typical of the plant family Plantaginaceae. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The glandular hairs on its leaves and stems help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments."
