    "intro": "Ailanthus wightii, commonly known as the Indian tree of heaven, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
