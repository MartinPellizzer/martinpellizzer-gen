    "intro": "Aulomyrcia laruotteana var. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous aulomyrcia, is a rare plant species native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The leaves are typically thin and membranous, giving the plant its varietal name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are often pale in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
