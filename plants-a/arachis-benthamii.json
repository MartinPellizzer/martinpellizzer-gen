    "intro": "Arachis benthamii, commonly known as the wild peanut, is a species native to South America. It is a herbaceous annual plant that belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has compound leaves with pinnate structures. Its seeds are encased in a pod, similar to other peanuts, but it is not cultivated for commercial peanut production. Arachis benthamii is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential for hybridization with cultivated peanuts."
