    "intro": "Ampelocissus erioclada, commonly known as the rock fig or climbing fig, is a woody vine native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its stems are covered in tendrils that aid in climbing. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when ripe. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Ampelocissus erioclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
