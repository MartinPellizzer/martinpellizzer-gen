It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy blooms that range in color from pale purple to deep violet. The plant typically grows in rocky soil and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its unique morphology includes specialized roots that aid in nutrient absorption from poor soils. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Anogra perplexa is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of ongoing scientific study."
