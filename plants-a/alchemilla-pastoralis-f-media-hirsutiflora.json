It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. This variety is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of the habitat."
