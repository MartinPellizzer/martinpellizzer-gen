    "intro": "Angraecum cordatiglandulum, commonly known as the heart-shaped glandular angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its unique, pendulous inflorescence that bears fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by the Madagascar star moth, a specialized nocturnal pollinator. Angraecum cordatiglandulum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its rarity and elegance."
