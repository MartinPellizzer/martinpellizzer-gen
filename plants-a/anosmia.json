    "intro": "Anosmia, commonly known as the loss of the sense of smell, is not a plant but a medical condition affecting humans. However, the term may be confused with plants that have similar names or characteristics. In botany, there are no plants named \"anosmia\" that are widely recognized. If there is a plant with a similar name, it may refer to a species with a lack of fragrance or scent. It is important to distinguish between medical terms and botanical nomenclature to avoid confusion."
