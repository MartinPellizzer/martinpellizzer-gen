It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dense, dark green coloration. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium latecuneatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
