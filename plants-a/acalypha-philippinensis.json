    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha philippinensis is primarily native to the Philippines. It is found in various regions across the archipelago, including Luzon, Mindanao, and Samar. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is commonly found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of Borneo and Sumatra, extending its native range into neighboring Southeast Asian countries. The species is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha philippinensis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. The plant has been reported in several countries outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread in some areas. However, it is generally not considered invasive and is often used as a decorative plant rather than an ecological threat."
