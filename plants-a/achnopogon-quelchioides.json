It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes and wetlands. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help in anchoring and nutrient absorption.",
