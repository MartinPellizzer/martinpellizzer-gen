    "intro": "Astragalus fetissowii, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is extensive, adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Astragalus fetissowii is also of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
