    "intro": "Aira distichophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically two-ranked, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Aira distichophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
