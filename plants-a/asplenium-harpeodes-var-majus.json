    "intro": "Asplenium harpeodes var. majus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape that gives the genus its common name."
