    "intro": "Anemonoides prattii, commonly known as the Pratts' anemone, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Anemonoides prattii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
