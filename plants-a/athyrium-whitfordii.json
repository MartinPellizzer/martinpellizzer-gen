    "intro": "Athyrium whitfordii, commonly known as the Whitford's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are usually a deep green, with a finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance. Athyrium whitfordii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
