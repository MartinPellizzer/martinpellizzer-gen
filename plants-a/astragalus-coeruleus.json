    "intro": "Astragalus coeruleus, commonly known as blue milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Astragalus coeruleus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
