    "intro": "Amarella scopulorum, commonly known as the rock amarella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific alpine and rocky habitats. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
