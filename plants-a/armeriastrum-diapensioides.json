    "intro": "Armeriastrum diapensioides, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal areas of California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is often found in dunes and along the edges of coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
