    "intro": "Acrostichum reptans, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas gradually. The leaves are typically bright green and have a soft, leathery texture.",
