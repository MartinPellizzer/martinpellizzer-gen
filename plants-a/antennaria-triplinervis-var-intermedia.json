    "intro": "Antennaria triplinervis var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
