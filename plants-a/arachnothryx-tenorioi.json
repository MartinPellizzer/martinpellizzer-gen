    "intro": "Arachnothryx tenorioi, commonly known as the Tenorio's arachnothryx, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to the trunks of trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying biodiversity in tropical ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
