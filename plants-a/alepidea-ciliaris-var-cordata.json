    "intro": "Alepidea ciliaris var. cordata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sand mat, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that are broad and rounded. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
