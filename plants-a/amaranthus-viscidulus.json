    "intro": "Amaranthus viscidulus, commonly known as sticky amaranth, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, often sticky leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Amaranthus viscidulus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
