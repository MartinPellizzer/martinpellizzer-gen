    "intro": "Andinia stalactites, commonly known as ice plants, are succulent plants native to southern Africa. They are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves that form a rosette shape. These plants thrive in arid environments and are adapted to store water in their thick, fleshy tissues. They produce small, star-shaped flowers that are often white or yellow in color. Andinia stalactites are popular among succulent enthusiasts due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
