    "intro": "Agrostis nevadensis var. minor, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
