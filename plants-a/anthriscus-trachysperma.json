    "intro": "Anthriscus trachysperma, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small, ribbed, and have a distinctive, pungent odor. Anthriscus trachysperma is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
