    "intro": "Adiantum raddianum, commonly known as the rattan fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional crafts, particularly in the production of rattan furniture. Adiantum raddianum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities.",
