    "intro": "Alchemilla othmarii, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky, silver-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Alchemilla othmarii is also valued for its historical association with alchemy and its traditional use in herbal medicine."
