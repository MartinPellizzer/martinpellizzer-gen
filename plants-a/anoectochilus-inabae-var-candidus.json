    "intro": "Anoectochilus inabae var. candidus, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive white-veined leaves that give it its common name. The flowers are typically small, with a pale yellow to white coloration and a unique, intricate pattern on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments with dappled sunlight, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in horticultural circles and is considered a conservation concern."
