    "intro": "Acacia tetragonocarpa var. scabra, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its quadrangular, ridged stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, which appear during the warmer months. Its small, hard pods contain several seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and forage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tetragonocarpa var. scabra is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savanna and grassland ecosystems. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. The species is often seen growing along riverbanks and in rocky outcrops. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with low rainfall and sparse vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tetragonocarpa var. scabra was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soil. It also serves as a valuable source of browse for livestock and wildlife. Its introduction has been both beneficial and problematic, as it can become invasive in certain environments."
