    "intro": "Aegokeras caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted grass or false brome, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, forming dense, clump-like growths. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. It is generally hardy and adaptable, thriving in a range of environmental conditions."
