    "intro": "Astragalus tricarinatus, commonly known as the three-ribbed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three distinct leaflets and small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Astragalus tricarinatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
