    "intro": "Asplenium lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, soil banks, and woodland floors. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a leathery texture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Asplenium lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
