This variety is commonly found in high-altitude forests within the tropical and subtropical zones of these areas. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often growing in mixed evergreen forests. The plant is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat, including high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions due to its particular environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. maxwellii was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes where it can thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal, featuring conical shape and dark green foliage. It is often used as a specimen tree or in mixed borders due to its hardiness and adaptability. However, it may require protection from strong winds and extreme temperature fluctuations."
