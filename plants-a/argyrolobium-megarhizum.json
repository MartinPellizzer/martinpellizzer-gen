    "intro": "Argyrolobium megarhizum, commonly known as the giant root vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its deep taproot system, which allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, typical of many leguminous species. Argyrolobium megarhizum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
