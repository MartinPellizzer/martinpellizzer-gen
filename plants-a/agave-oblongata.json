    "intro": "Agave oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are narrow and pointed, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem. Agave oblongata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
