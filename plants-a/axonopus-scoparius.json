    "intro": "Axonopus scoparius, commonly known as coastal grass or beach grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It typically forms dense mats on sandy soils, helping to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It thrives in saline and well-drained environments, making it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions."
