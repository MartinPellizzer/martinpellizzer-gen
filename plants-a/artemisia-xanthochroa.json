    "intro": "Artemisia xanthochroa, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its drought tolerance and aromatic properties, it is also used in traditional medicine and as a landscaping plant."
