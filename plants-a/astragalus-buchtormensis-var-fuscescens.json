    "intro": "Astragalus buchtormensis var. fuscescens, commonly known as the dark-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the steppes of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and robust, enabling it to access moisture from lower soil layers. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators."
