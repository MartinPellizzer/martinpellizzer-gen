    "intro": "Atriplex paludosa subsp. cordata, commonly known as marsh saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to wetland and saline environments in North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid or brackish conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it an important species in stabilizing coastal and marsh ecosystems. It is often found in association with other halophytic plants in saline soils."
