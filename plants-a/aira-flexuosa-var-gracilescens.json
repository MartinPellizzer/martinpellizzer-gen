    "intro": "Aira flexuosa var. gracilescens, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical structure is characterized by a fibrous root system and a basal rosette of leaves. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
