    "intro": "Armeria ambifaria, commonly known as the double-flowered thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Armeria ambifaria is often used in rock gardens and as a coastal plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
