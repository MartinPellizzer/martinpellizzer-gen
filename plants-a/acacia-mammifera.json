    "intro": "Acacia mammifera, commonly known as the hairy wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly branches and its distinctive yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, needle-like leaflets, and the plant produces pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in reforestation projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia mammifera is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. Acacia mammifera plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia mammifera was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its use in livestock feed. It is commonly found in degraded lands and along roadsides in semi-arid regions. The plant has a deep root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent further degradation. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. However, its rapid growth can sometimes lead to the displacement of native vegetation if not managed properly."
