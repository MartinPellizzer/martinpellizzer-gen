    "intro": "Astragalus xipholobus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, narrow, pinnately compound leaves. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus xipholobus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
