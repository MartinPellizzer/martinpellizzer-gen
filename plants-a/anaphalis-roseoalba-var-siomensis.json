    "intro": "Anaphalis roseoalba var. siomensis, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it adapts to cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The species is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family, sharing similar floral structures and growth habits."
