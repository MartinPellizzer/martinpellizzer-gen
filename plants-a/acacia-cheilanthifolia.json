    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cheilanthifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sandstone formations, and dry shrublands. This species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its resilience, it is often used in reforestation and land rehabilitation projects in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cheilanthifolia was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates due to its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high temperatures. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasiveness in certain environments. It is important to monitor its spread to prevent negative impacts on native ecosystems."
