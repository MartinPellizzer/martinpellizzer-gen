    "intro": "Astragalus canescens, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Astragalus canescens is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
