    "intro": "Astragalus jaskensis, commonly known as the Jask milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Astragalus. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, often found in mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
