    "intro": "Aloe perfoliata, commonly known as the red aloe or red-stemmed aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially at the base. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and for their gel, which has moisturizing properties. Aloe perfoliata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
