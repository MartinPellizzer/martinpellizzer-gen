    "intro": "Alisma ranunculoides var. elatior, commonly known as the greater water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in shallow water. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
