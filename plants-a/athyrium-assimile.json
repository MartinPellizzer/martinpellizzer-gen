    "intro": "Athyrium assimile, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a deciduous fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
