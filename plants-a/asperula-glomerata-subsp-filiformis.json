    "intro": "Asperula glomerata subsp. filiformis, commonly known as the silky woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in woodland gardens."
