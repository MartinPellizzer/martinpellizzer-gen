    "intro": "Andropogon rhizophorus, commonly known as the purple bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking purple tassels that appear in late summer. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the fall. Andropogon rhizophorus is often found in prairies, woodlands, and disturbed sites, where it plays a vital role in ecological succession."
