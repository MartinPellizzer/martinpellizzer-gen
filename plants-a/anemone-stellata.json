    "intro": "Anemone stellata, commonly known as the star anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white or pale pink flowers with a star-like appearance, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
