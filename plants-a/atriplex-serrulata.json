    "intro": "Atriplex serrulata, commonly known as sandmat, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal areas. Atriplex serrulata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
