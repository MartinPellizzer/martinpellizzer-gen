    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 floribunda, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a hybrid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring, forming upright clusters known as panicles. The plant produces large, spiny capsules containing shiny, chestnut-like seeds. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are serrated and have a distinctive palmate shape. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
