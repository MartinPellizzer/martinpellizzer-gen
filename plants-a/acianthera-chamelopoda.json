It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and is typically found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other plants. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects.",
