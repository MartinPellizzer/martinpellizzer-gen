    "intro": "Aspilia aurantiaca var. vulcanica, commonly known as the Vulcan's fireball, is a striking plant native to volcanic regions of Africa. It features bright orange, spherical flower heads that resemble small flames, giving it its dramatic common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a dense cluster of yellow stamens surrounded by red bracts. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or barren landscapes. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical climates."
