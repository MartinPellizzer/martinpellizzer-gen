    "intro": "Anthericum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky anthericum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its unique feature is the sticky substance secreted by the leaves, which can trap small insects. This plant is often found in damp, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream sides."
