    "intro": "Ajax minor var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf ajax, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
