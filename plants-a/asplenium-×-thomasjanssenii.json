    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 thomasjanssenii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is a compact, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, thriving in rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are usually upright, with a distinctive zigzag pattern, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. As a hybrid, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shady garden settings."
