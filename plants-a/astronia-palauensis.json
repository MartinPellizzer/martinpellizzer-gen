    "intro": "Astronia palauensis, commonly known as the Palau starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the islands of Palau in the Western Pacific. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as the cashew and mango. The tree is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a spherical, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various birds and insects. Due to its limited geographic range, Astronia palauensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
