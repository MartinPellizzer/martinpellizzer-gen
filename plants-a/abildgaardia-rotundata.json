    "intro": "Abildgaardia rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf abildgaardia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features rounded, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the base, giving it a compact appearance.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia rotundata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the regions of the Western Cape, including the fynbos biome. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast and in mountainous areas. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and coastal cliffs. Its distribution is limited to a few localized areas within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia rotundata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, rounded leaves. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, making it a common sight in forested regions. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
