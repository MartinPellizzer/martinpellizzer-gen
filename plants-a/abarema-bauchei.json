    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema bauchei is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans along the eastern coast of the country. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Abarema bauchei is also known to occur in parts of Paraguay and Argentina.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema bauchei was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for gardens and landscaped environments. The plant has been cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native habitats. Despite its beauty, proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
