    "intro": "Asplenium tenerum var. tenerum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation."
