    "intro": "Arabis arcuata var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, basal leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety longipes is distinguished by its longer pedicels compared to the typical form of Arabis arcuata."
