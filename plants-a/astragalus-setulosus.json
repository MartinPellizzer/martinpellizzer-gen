    "intro": "Astragalus setulosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus setulosus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
