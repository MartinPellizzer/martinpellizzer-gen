    "intro": "Anthericum filiforme var. reflexipilosum, commonly known as the reflexed hairy lily of the valley, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
