    "intro": "Amelanchier canadensis subvar. tomentula, commonly known as the Canadian serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and produces clusters of white flowers in early spring. The plant bears edible berries that ripen to a reddish-purple color in late summer. Its leaves are typically oval with a smooth texture and turn yellow in the fall. This variety is well-suited for woodland gardens and has ornamental value due to its spring flowers and fall foliage."
