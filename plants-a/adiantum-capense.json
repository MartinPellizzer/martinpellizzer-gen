    "intro": "Adiantum capense, commonly known as the Natal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates. The fronds are usually bright green, with a slightly glossy surface and a distinctive, fern-like appearance.",
