It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and a warm climate. It is known for its hairy leaves and showy flowers, which attract pollinators. Abutilon hirtum has been used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes in various parts of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon hirtum was mainly introduced to the Caribbean islands, Central America, and parts of South America, including Aruba, Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Florida, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Leeward Is., Marquesas, Mauritius, Netherlands Antilles, New Caledonia, Nicaragua, Panam\u00e1, Peru, Puerto Rico, Rodrigues, R\u00e9union, Taiwan, Trinidad-Tobago, Turks-Caicos Is., Venezuela, and Windward Is. It has been widely distributed across these regions, often as an ornamental plant or for its fibrous bark. The plant's adaptability to various climates has contributed to its successful introduction and establishment in these areas. It is commonly found in coastal regions and disturbed habitats. Its presence in these locations highlights its role as an invasive or naturalized species in many of these regions."
