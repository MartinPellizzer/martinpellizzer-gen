    "intro": "Agathophyllum obtusatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It has a low, sprawling growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Agathophyllum obtusatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
