    "intro": "Arabidopsis mollissima, commonly known as the woolly Arabidopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a woolly appearance. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, rounded pods containing several seeds. Due to its compact size and genetic simplicity, it is sometimes used in ecological studies to understand plant adaptation to arid environments."
