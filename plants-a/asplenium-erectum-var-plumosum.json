    "intro": "Asplenium erectum var. plumosum, commonly known as the plumosum spleenwort, is a fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a soft, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. The species is notable for its low-growing habit and is often found in humid, temperate climates."
