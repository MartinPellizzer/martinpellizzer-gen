    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum var. parvulum, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often curved and have a distinctive, moon-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and fern enthusiasts."
