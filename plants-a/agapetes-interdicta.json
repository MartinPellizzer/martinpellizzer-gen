It typically grows at high altitudes, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries.
