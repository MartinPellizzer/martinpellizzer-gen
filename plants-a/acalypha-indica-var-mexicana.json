    "intro": "Acalypha indica var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers, giving it a dramatic visual appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, adding to its aesthetic appeal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha indica var. mexicana is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. It is also found in parts of the Caribbean, including the Greater Antilles. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in forests, along stream banks, and in agricultural areas. Its native range extends into some regions of northern South America as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha indica var. mexicana was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Texas, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was commonly used in landscaping and as a ground cover because of its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant's spread has been facilitated by its ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively, making it difficult to control. As a result, it is now considered a noxious weed in several regions where it has established itself."
