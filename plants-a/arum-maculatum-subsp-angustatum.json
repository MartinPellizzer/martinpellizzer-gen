    "intro": "Arum maculatum subsp. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical subspecies. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is often brightly colored to attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
