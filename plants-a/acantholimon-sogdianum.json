    "intro": "Acantholimon sogdianum, commonly known as the Sogdian flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features such as deep root systems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

This plant is typically found in mountainous regions, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It plays a role in the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon sogdianum was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that mimic its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and arid or semi-arid environments. This plant is often found in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. Its introduction has been noted in certain parts of North America and Europe. However, its distribution remains limited due to its specific ecological requirements."
