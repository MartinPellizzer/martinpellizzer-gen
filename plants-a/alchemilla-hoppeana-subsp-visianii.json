    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana subsp. visianii, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
