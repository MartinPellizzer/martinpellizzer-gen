    "intro": "Agrostis howellii, commonly known as Howell's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet or waterlogged soils, making it a common indicator species in riparian zones. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
