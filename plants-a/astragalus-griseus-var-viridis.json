    "intro": "Astragalus griseus var. viridis, commonly known as green silky milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to greenish-white. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped seeds enclosed in a hairy pod, and its leaves are typically trifoliate with a silvery or greenish hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or used in ecological restoration projects."
