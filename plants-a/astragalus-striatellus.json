    "intro": "Astragalus striatellus, commonly known as the striated milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus striatellus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
