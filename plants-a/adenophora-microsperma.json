It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stalks, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Adenophora microsperma is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun.",
