    "intro": "Aspidium heterosorum, commonly known as the heterosporous water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Water Fern Family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring two types of spores\u2014megaspores and microspores\u2014produced on separate sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that aids in its identification. Aspidium heterosorum plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
