It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The tree produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. Its bark is distinctive, featuring a rough, flaky texture that peels away in patches. The plant is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and mountainous regions.",
