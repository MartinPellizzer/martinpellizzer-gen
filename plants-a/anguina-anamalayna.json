    "intro": "Anguina anamalayna, commonly known as the Malagasy snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail endemic to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Achatinidae and is characterized by its spiral shell with a smooth, glossy surface. The snail's body is typically pale in color, with a slightly elongated shape that allows it to navigate through dense vegetation. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and plays a role in seed dispersal and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited research, its conservation status remains uncertain."
