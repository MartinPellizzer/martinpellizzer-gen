    "intro": "Asterocephalus creticus, commonly known as the Cretic Starhead, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and yellow, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asterocephalus creticus is considered a vulnerable species."
