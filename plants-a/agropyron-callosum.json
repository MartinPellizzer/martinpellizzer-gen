    "intro": "Agropyron callosum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, rough-textured leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Agropyron callosum is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
