    "intro": "Agave purpurea, commonly known as the purple agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green to purple in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy texture to reduce water loss. It produces striking white or pale pink flowers on tall, branched stalks during the growing season. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
