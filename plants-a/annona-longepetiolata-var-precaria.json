    "intro": "Annona longepetiolata var. precaria, commonly known as the long-petioled soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with long petioles, which distinguish it from other annona species. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but is generally smaller and has a more acidic flavor. Its flowers are typically yellow with a strong scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value."
