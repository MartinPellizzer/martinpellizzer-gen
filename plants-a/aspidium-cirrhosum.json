    "intro": "Aspidium cirrhosum, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium cirrhosum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
