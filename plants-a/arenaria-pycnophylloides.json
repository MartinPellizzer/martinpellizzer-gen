    "intro": "Arenaria pycnophylloides, commonly known as the dense-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink, typically in the spring. The plant has compact, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in preventing erosion."
