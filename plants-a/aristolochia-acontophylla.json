    "intro": "Aristolochia acontophylla, commonly known as the purple-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, purple to violet flowers that resemble a pipe, often with a strong, complex fragrance. The plant is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its unique floral morphology and chemical compounds. However, it contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
