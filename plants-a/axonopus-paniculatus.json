    "intro": "Axonopus paniculatus, commonly known as the flat sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in wetland areas. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
