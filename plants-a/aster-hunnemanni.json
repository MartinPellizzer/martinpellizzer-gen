    "intro": "Aster hunnemanni, commonly known as the Hunneman's aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flower heads consist of both ray and disk florets. Aster hunnemanni is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
