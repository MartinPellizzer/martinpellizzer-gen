    "intro": "Ailuroschia hypogaeus, commonly known as the ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are typically purple or blue, arranged in whorls along the stem. Ailuroschia hypogaeus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and garden beds."
