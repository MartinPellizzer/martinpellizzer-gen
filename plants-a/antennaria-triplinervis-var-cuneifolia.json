    "intro": "Antennaria triplinervis var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, hairy, and often reddish-tinged leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its stems are usually prostrate or ascending, and the leaves are characterized by their narrow, linear shape. This variety is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
