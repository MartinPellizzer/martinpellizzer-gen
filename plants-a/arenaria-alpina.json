    "intro": "Arenaria alpina, commonly known as alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Arenaria alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
