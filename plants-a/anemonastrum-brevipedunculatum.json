    "intro": "Anemonastrum brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically has a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in reducing water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters at the ends of short peduncles. Anemonastrum brevipedunculatum is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water availability."
