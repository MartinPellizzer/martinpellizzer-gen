    "intro": "Asplenium ramosum, commonly known as the fork fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates like soil or rock. Asplenium ramosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
