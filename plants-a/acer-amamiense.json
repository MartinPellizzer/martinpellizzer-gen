    "intro": "Acer amamiense, commonly known as the Amami maple, is a species of maple native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters. The plant features palmate leaves with five lobes, which are bright green during the growing season and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, while the fruits are samaras with a winged structure that aids in wind dispersal. The Amami maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",

The plant is found in subtropical and tropical moist lowland forests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in this area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer amamiense was mainly introduced to Japan, where it has been found growing in the Amami Islands. This species is native to Southeast Asia and was likely introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf structure and aesthetic appeal. It has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions in Japan. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora. Despite its beauty, further study is needed to assess its ecological effects."
