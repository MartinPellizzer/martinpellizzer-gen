    "intro": "Armeria alpinifolia, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings. Armeria alpinifolia is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
