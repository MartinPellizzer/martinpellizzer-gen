    "intro": "Allosorus pruinatus, commonly known as the pruinose alpine moss, is a member of the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. It is a small, terrestrial moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest floors. The plant has a distinctive silvery or whitish coating on its leaves, which is due to the presence of a pruinose layer composed of fine, powdery cells. This feature helps reduce water loss and protects the moss from excessive sunlight. Allosorus pruinatus is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
