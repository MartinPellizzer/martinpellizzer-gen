    "intro": "Angraecum eburneum subsp. xerophilum, commonly known as the Xerophilum orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs during the rainy season, adding to its allure for orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
