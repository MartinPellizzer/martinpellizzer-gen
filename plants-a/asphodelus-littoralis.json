    "intro": "Asphodelus littoralis, commonly known as sea asphodel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces spikes of yellow or white flowers. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize sandy soils."
