    "intro": "Artemisia condensata, commonly known as Chinese wormwood, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains various volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, contributing to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
