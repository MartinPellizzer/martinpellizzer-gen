    "intro": "Amaracarpus pubescens subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy amaracarpus, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
