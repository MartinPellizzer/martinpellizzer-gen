    "intro": "Arisaema triphyllum f. viride, commonly known as the Green Jack-in-the-Pulpit, is a variant of the Jack-in-the-Pulpit plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, hooded spathe that encloses a spadix, a structure that bears the actual flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green. Its foliage is a key feature, with a striking contrast to the green spathe. The plant is noted for its adaptability and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
