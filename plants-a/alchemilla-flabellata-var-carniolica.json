    "intro": "Alchemilla flabellata var. carniolica, commonly known as the Carniolan lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the Alps and surrounding regions. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to rhomboidal, with a distinctive wavy margin and a soft, silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
