It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is closely related to other members of the Amblyanthera genus, which are known for their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations."
