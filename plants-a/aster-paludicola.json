    "intro": "Aster paludicola, commonly known as the marsh aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with purple-blue petals and yellow centers, blooming from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Aster paludicola plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
