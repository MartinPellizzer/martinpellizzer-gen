    "intro": "Aristida diffusa var. densa, commonly known as dense hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered with short, appressed hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
