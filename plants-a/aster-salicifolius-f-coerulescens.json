It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees, giving it its species name. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower heads in the late summer and early fall. Its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
