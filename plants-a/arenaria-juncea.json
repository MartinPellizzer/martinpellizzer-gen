    "intro": "Arenaria juncea, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand drought make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
