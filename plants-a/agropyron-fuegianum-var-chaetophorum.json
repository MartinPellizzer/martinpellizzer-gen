It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate to cold climates and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization in its native environment."
