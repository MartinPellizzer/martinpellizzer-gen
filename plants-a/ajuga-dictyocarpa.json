    "intro": "Ajuga dictyocarpa, commonly known as the common bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Ajuga dictyocarpa is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular ground cover in woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming thick mats that can suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion."
