It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spherical white flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. Its aromatic leaves are used in culinary applications, similar to regular chives. The variety is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
