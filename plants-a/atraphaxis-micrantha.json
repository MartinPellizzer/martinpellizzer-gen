    "intro": "Atraphaxis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered desert shrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Atraphaxis micrantha is well-suited for xerophytic conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
