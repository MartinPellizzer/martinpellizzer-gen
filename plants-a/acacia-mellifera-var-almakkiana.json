    "intro": "Acacia mellifera var. almakkiana, commonly known as the Yemen acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellowish-green to golden-yellow inflorescences, which are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils and high temperatures. This variety is valued for its ecological role and traditional uses in the region.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia mellifera var. almakkiana is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Eritrea, Somalia, and parts of Ethiopia. It is also found in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Yemen and Oman. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the edges of deserts. Its distribution is closely associated with regions that have a dry climate and limited rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia mellifera var. almakkiana was mainly introduced to southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia, Angola, and South Africa. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy soils and rocky outcrops. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought conditions. It also provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its introduction has helped stabilize degraded landscapes in these areas."
