    "intro": "Alonsoa incisifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alonsoa, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, often at high elevations. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive serrated edge, contributing to its common name. Alonsoa incisifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
