    "intro": "Aspalathus humilis, commonly known as the Blouberg bush, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Aspalathus humilis is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
