    "intro": "Aconitum ferox subsp. palmatum, commonly known as the palmate aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately divided leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear showy blue to purple flowers. The plant is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens with caution.",
