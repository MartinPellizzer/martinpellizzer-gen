    "intro": "Aquilegia discolor, commonly known as the white columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces showy, clustered flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with five to seven lobes, and are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Aquilegia discolor thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower displays."
