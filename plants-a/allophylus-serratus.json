It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, forested areas. The plant has simple, opposite, and often serrated leaves, which contribute to its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female flowers present on the same plant. Allophylus serratus is valued for its hard wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
