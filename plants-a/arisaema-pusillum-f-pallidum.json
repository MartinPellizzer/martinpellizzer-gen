    "intro": "Arisaema pusillum f. pallidum, commonly known as the pale spathed arisaema, is a variant of the lesser arisaema, characterized by its distinctive pale green foliage and reduced spathes. It is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of East Asia, including China and Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological traits and its role in the Araceae family's floral diversity. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological interest in woodland gardens."
