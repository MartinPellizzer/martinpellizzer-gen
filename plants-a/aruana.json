    "intro": "Aruana, commonly known as the golden trumpet or *Championella grandiflora*, is a striking tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that resemble trumpets, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment. Aruana is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant appearance. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should not be handled or ingested."
