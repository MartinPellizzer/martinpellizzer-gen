    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 novograblenovii, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile, naturally occurring hybrid between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and tufted growth habit, often found in moist, temperate environments. The plant typically forms dense mats and is adapted to a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. It is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in meadows, pastures, and along waterways. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds, relying on vegetative propagation for spread."
