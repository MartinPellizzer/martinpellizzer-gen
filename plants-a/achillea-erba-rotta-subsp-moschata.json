    "intro": "Achillea erba-rotta subsp. moschata, commonly known as sweet yarrow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a rosette of basal, gray-green, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in summer. The plant is characterized by its strong, pleasant fragrance, which is attributed to essential oils in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats. This subspecies is closely related to other yarrow species and is valued for its ornamental and historical uses.",
