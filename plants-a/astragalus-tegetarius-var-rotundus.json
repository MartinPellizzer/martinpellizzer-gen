    "intro": "Astragalus tegetarius var. rotundus, commonly known as the roundleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its rounded, palmate leaves and small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several small, lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry soils and can often be found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various wildlife species."
