    "intro": "Amygdalus orientalis var. discolor, commonly known as the Persian almond or white-flowered almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval fruits that mature into hard, woody nuts, similar to those of the common almond. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic appeal."
