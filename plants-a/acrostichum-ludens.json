    "intro": "Acrostichum ludens, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or near water sources. The golden fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous cultures.",
