    "intro": "Asplenium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium sikkimense is native to the Himalayan regions and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters."
