    "intro": "Aloe tidmarshii, commonly known as the Tidmarsh aloe, is a rare and unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, often featuring white or yellowish marginal teeth. The plant produces striking yellow flowers on tall, slender stems, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
