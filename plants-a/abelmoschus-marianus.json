    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus marianus is primarily native to southern and eastern Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. This plant thrives in warm, humid environments and is often associated with wetlands and riverbanks. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions across these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus marianus was mainly introduced to areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive and produce its edible pods. It is commonly found in regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and parts of the Americas. The plant is valued for its nutritional content, including high levels of vitamins and minerals. Its introduction has often been associated with agricultural expansion and trade activities. However, it has also been noted as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora."
