    "intro": "Asplenium septentrionale subsp. caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian spleenwort, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its morphological similarities to other members of the *Asplenium* genus but exhibits distinct geographical distribution and habitat preferences."
