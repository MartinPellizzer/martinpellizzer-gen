It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans several states in eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Abarema cordifolia is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema cordifolia was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and moderate rainfall, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions. Its introduction has been driven by its aesthetic value and adaptability to different soil types. However, it requires careful management to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
