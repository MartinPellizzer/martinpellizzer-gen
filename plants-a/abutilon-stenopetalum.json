    "intro": "Abutilon stenopetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled abutilon, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, often with five petals that are narrow and pointed. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. Abutilon stenopetalum prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for warm climate gardens.",
