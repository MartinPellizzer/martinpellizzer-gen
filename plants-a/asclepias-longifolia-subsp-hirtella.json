    "intro": "Asclepias longifolia subsp. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to orange flowers with distinctive, hooded buds. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This subspecies is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
