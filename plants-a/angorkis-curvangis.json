    "intro": "Angorkis curvangis, commonly known as the wavy-leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, wavy-edged leaves that range in color from deep green to silvery blue. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of violet and white, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern."
