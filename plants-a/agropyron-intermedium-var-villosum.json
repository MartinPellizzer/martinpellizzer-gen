    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. villosum, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and as a decorative plant."
