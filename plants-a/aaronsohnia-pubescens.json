    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aaronsohnia pubescens is primarily native to the eastern and central regions of North America. It is commonly found in the United States, particularly in states such as Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. It is also present in parts of Canada, including Ontario and Quebec. Its distribution is closely associated with riparian zones and wetlands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aaronsohnia pubescens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was first documented in Oregon in the early 20th century as a result of human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental transport. This plant has since spread to nearby areas, including parts of Washington and British Columbia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on native plant species."
