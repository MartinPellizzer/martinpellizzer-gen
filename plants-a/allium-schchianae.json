    "intro": "Allium schchianae, commonly known as the Armenian leek, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valuable addition to local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
