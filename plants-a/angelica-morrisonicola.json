    "intro": "Angelica morrisonicola, commonly known as Morrison's angelica, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by oval, dark brown seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically important to conserve this unique botanical species."
