    "intro": "Athrophyllum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Athrophyllum species usually have small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of their leaves. The genus includes several species, each with unique leaf shapes and growth habits, making them popular among fern enthusiasts."
