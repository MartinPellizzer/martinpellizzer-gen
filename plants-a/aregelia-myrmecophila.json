    "intro": "Aregelia myrmecophila, commonly known as the antplant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its specialized structures called domatia, which are hollow, swollen nodes that provide shelter for colonies of ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants, forming a mutualistic relationship. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae and produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with multiple stems and dense foliage that supports its ant inhabitants."
