    "intro": "Abies lasciocarpa, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal crown and needle-like leaves that are typically a dark green on top and whitish underneath. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is generally smooth and grayish-brown, becoming furrowed with age. Abies lasciocarpa is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays an important role in forest ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies lasciocarpa is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is found in the states of Oaxaca, Puebla, Veracruz, and Guerrero. This species typically grows in humid, temperate climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in cloud forests and pine-oak ecosystems. The plant is an important component of the biodiversity in these high-altitude habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies lasciocarpa was mainly introduced to specific regions in the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. It was introduced primarily for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. The plant has been cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in cool, moist climates. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. It is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
