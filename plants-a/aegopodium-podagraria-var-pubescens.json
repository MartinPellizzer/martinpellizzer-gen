    "intro": "Aegopodium podagraria var. pubescens, commonly known as bishop's weed or ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically dark green with a white underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
