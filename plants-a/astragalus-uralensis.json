    "intro": "Astragalus uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia and northern regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe ecosystems. Astragalus uralensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
