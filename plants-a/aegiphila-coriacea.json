    "intro": "Aegiphila coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf aegiphila, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Aegiphila coriacea is adapted to survive in harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
