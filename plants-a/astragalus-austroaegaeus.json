    "intro": "Astragalus austroaegaeus, commonly known as the southern rock milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus austroaegaeus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
