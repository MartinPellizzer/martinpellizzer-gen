    "intro": "Astragalus latebracteatus, commonly known as the late bract milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Astragalus latebracteatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
