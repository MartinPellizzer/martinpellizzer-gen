    "intro": "Alliaria wasabi, commonly known as wasabi, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its bright green, fern-like leaves and small white or yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often grown in shaded, well-drained soil. Its rhizomes, which are the main edible part, contain a spicy compound called allyl isothiocyanate. This compound is responsible for wasabi's distinctive flavor and pungent aroma."
