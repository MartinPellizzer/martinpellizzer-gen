    "intro": "Arenaria holosteoides, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread across open habitats."
