    "intro": "Allium montelburzense, commonly known as the Montelburgo garlic, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine, valued for their pungent aroma and potential health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
