    "intro": "Adiantum viride, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Adiantum viride is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
