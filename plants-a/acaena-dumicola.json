    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena dumicola is primarily native to the southern regions of New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in areas with rocky or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in coastal and inland environments, often growing in open vegetation or on disturbed ground. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and can tolerate both dry and wet conditions. Acaena dumicola plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena dumicola was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade. This species has since become naturalized and is now found in various regions across the country. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be seen along roadsides and in forest margins. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly."
