    "intro": "Astragalus miser var. decurrens, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features slender, decurrent stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, with small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. Its leaves are narrow and pinnately divided, and it produces small, oblong legumes as fruits. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
