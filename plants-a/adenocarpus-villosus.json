It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive, hairy, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Adenocarpus villosus is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment.",
