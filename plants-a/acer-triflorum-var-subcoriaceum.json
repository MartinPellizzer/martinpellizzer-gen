    "intro": "Acer triflorum var. subcoriaceum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maple, is a variant of the triflorum maple characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are typically lighter in color compared to the standard species. It is native to eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and gold in the fall, making it a popular ornamental tree. The leaves are often more elongated and have a distinct, slightly glossy appearance compared to other maple varieties.",
