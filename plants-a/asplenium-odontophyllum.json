    "intro": "Asplenium odontophyllum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium odontophyllum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
