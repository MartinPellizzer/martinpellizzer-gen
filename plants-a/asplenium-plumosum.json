    "intro": "Asplenium plumosum, commonly known as the plumose spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are finely divided and feather-like in appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in acidic soils and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Asplenium plumosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
