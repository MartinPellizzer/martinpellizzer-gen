    "intro": "Amorphophallus dactylifer, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater lakes and ponds. The plant's most distinctive feature is its large, showy flowers, which can reach up to one meter in height and bloom at night. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
