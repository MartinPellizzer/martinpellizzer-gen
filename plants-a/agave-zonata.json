    "intro": "Agave zonata, commonly known as the variegated agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The leaves are typically bluish-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear white or green flowers, followed by small, fleshy fruits. This plant is well adapted to dry climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking appearance."
