    "intro": "Anemonoides amurensis subsp. kamtchatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern Asia. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a characteristic species of temperate and subarctic flora."
