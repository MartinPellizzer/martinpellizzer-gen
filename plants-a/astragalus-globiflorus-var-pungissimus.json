    "intro": "Astragalus globiflorus var. pungissimus, commonly known as the pungent globeflower, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescence composed of numerous small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with hairy surfaces adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This variant is notable for its distinctive, pungent odor, which is more pronounced in its flowers."
