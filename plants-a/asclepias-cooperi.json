    "intro": "Asclepias cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Cooper's milkweed is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting their life cycle. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun."
