    "intro": "Anatherum virginicum subvar. arenarium, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Sand bluestem is an important component of native plant communities and provides habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
