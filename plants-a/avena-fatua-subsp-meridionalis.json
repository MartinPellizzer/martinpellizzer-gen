    "intro": "Avena fatua subsp. meridionalis, commonly known as the southern wild oat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, pale florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive weed in many areas."
