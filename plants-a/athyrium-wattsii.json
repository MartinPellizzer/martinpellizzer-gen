    "intro": "Athyrium wattsii, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. Athyrium wattsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
