    "intro": "Alchemilla subsericea, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Alchemilla subsericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
