    "intro": "Azorella patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, woolly leaves that form a compact cushion. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season in its harsh, cold environment. Azorella patagonica is adapted to extreme conditions, including strong winds, low temperatures, and intense solar radiation. Its unique morphology allows it to conserve moisture and withstand the challenging climatic conditions of the Andes."
