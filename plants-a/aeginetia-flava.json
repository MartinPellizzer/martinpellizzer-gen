    "intro": "Aeginetia flava, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub that produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are usually small and succulent. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability. The yellow sandmat is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance in stabilizing sandy soils."
