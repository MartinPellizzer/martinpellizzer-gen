    "intro": "Asplenium cuneatum var. caripense, commonly known as the Caripense maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a feather. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of root hairs, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and can vary in length depending on the growing conditions."
