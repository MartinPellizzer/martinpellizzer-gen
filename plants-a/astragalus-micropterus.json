It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus micropterus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
