It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a white or pink center. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
