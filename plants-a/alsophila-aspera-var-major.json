It features a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Its trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
