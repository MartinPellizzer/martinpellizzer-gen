    "intro": "Allium fibriferum, commonly known as the curly leek or woolly garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous leaves that form a rosette and its clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to onions, which are used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Allium fibriferum is valued for its aromatic properties and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
