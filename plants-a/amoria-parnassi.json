    "intro": "Amoria parnassi, commonly known as the Parnassian orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow or greenish flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moist, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical specimen from habitat loss and over-collection."
