    "intro": "Athyrium monomachii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a shield in shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium monomachii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
