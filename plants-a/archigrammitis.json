It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features a prostrate or upright stem with whorled leaves that are often needle-like in appearance. Its reproductive structures include microsporangia and megasporangia, which are borne on specialized leaves called sporophylls. Archigrammitis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
