    "intro": "Acantholimon tulakensis, commonly known as the tulakensis flaxvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically produces yellow or pale green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often trifoliate, and the plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Acantholimon tulakensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon tulakensis is primarily native to Afghanistan. This species is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at high altitudes. The plant is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region, including extreme temperature variations and limited soil nutrients. It is a part of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon tulakensis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is typically distributed in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Pacific Northwest. It thrives in environments with low to moderate water availability and is often seen in disturbed or open landscapes. Its introduction has been noted in ecological studies focusing on invasive plant species and their impact on local ecosystems."
