It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
