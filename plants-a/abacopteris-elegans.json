    "intro": "Abacopteris elegans, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil to flourish. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the wetland substrate. Abacopteris elegans plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abacopteris elegans is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, including regions such as New South Wales and Queensland. This plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. It is commonly associated with wind-blown sand habitats and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastline. The species is also found in some parts of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the Australian coastline.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abacopteris elegans was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, which allows it to spread rapidly in forested regions. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
