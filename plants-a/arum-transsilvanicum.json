    "intro": "Arum transsilvanicum, commonly known as the Transylvanian arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, particularly Romania and parts of the Balkans. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered on the spadix, which is often covered in a dense mass of tiny, inconspicuous blooms. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
