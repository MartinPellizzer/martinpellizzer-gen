    "intro": "Avena bromoides, commonly known as false oat or bromegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Avena bromoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
