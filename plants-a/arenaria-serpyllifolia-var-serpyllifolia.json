    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia var. serpyllifolia, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
