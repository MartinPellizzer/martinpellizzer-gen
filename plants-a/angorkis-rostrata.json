    "intro": "Angorkis rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated angorkis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and its unique inflorescence that consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Angorkis rostrata typically grows in wet, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
