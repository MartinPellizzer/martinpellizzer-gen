    "intro": "Athamanta flexuosa, commonly known as the spiral saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Athamanta flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh, high-altitude conditions."
