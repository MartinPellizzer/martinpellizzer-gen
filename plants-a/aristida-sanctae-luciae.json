It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
