    "intro": "Argostemma parishii, commonly known as the Cape York argostemma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
