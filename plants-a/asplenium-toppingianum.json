    "intro": "Asplenium toppingianum, commonly known as the Topping's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Asplenium toppingianum is a relatively uncommon species, with a restricted geographic distribution primarily in tropical and subtropical regions."
