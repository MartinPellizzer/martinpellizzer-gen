    "intro": "Amygdalus fremontii, commonly known as the Fremont peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible drupes that range in color from yellow to red. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. The Fremont peach is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping."
