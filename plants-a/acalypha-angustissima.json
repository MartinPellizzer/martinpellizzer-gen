This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forests or along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. However, it is not widely cultivated outside of its natural range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha angustissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
