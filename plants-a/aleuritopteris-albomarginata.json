    "intro": "Aleuritopteris albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, deeply lobed fronds that are often covered in a fine, white marginal band. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, but this trait is less pronounced in A. albomarginata."
