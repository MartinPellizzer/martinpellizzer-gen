    "intro": "Astragalus oroboides, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and mountain slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellow to orange flowers in late spring. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Astragalus oroboides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
