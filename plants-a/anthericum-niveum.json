    "intro": "Anthericum niveum, commonly known as the white adder's tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, pale green leaves with a white or pale blue underside. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. These flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
