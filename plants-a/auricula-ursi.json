    "intro": "Auricula-ursi, commonly known as the bear's ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that resemble a bear's ear, and its flowers, which are typically pink or red, bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. It is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used for its diuretic and antiseptic qualities. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in gardens with specific care to ensure its survival."
