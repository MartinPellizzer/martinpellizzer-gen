    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia camptoclada is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and woodland areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic component of the flora in Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia camptoclada was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and forage. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its rapid growth and potential to outcompete native species. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded lands."
