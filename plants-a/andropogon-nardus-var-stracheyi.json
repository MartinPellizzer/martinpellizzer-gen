    "intro": "Andropogon nardus var. stracheyi, commonly known as Strachey's sweetgrass, is a variant of the sweetgrass species native to the wetlands and marshy areas of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that grows in dense mats, often forming a thick cover in its natural habitat. The plant produces slender, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonial practices. Its flowering stems are relatively short and bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Botanically, it is characterized by its fine, wiry texture and its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
