    "intro": "Asplenium bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are typically clustered in small, fleshy structures called bulbils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Asplenium bulbiferum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
