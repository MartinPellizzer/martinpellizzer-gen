It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 3 to 5 cm long, with leathery, awned glumes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for forage or erosion control."
