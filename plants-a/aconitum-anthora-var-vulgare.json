    "intro": "Aconitum anthora var. vulgare, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple, hood-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in meadows and stream banks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care.",
