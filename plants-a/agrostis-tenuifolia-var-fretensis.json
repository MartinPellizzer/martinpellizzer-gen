    "intro": "Agrostis tenuifolia var. fretensis, commonly known as the Fretten's slender grass, is a variant of the slender grass species native to specific regions of Europe. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered closely together. It is adapted to harsh environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological characteristics and ecological niche."
