    "intro": "Atelophragma fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers and unique, elongated, ghost-like appearance. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It requires specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and filtered sunlight, to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
