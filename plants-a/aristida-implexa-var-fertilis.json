    "intro": "Aristida implexa var. fertilis, commonly known as the fertilized hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that often have a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color, with narrow, awned lemmas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
