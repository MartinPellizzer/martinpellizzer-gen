    "intro": "Acantholimon heweri, commonly known as the Heweri's thornedweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces capsules as its fruit, containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in dry climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon heweri is primarily native to Afghanistan. This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and southern areas. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at high altitudes. The species is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is known for its hardy and resilient nature.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon heweri was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, typically in open, sunny environments. It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and is often found in coastal or inland dune ecosystems. This plant is particularly adapted to arid or semi-arid climates, making it suitable for xerophytic habitats. It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements. Its distribution is often limited by soil type and water availability, which influences its natural range."
