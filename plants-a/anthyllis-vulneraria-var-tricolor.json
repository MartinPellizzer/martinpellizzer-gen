    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. tricolor, commonly known as the three-color kidney vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with two red or purple stipules. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are often a mix of white, red, and purple, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils across Europe and parts of Asia. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
