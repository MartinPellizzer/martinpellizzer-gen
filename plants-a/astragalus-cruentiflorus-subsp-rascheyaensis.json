    "intro": "Astragalus cruentiflorus subsp. rascheyaensis, commonly known as the Rascheyan milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
