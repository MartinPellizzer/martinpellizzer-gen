    "intro": "Aloe indica, commonly known as the Indian aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of India and Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-orange flowers, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is often used for its soothing and healing properties. Aloe indica is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening."
