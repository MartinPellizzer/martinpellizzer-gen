    "intro": "Agrostis geminata, commonly known as the twingrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, narrow leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, two-ranked spikelets. Agrostis geminata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
