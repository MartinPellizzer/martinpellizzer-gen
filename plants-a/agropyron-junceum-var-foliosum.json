    "intro": "Agropyron junceum var. foliosum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
