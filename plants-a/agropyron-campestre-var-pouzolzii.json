    "intro": "Agropyron campestre var. pouzolzii, commonly known as the meadow brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a rhizomatous growth habit that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
