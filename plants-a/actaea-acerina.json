    "intro": "Actaea acerina, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered, red berries that resemble small, poisonous berries. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer. Actaea acerina thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens, though its berries are toxic to humans and animals.",
