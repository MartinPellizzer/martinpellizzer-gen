    "intro": "Aspidium ligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium ligulatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
