    "intro": "Alchemilla michelsonii, commonly known as the Michelson's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in upright panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Alchemilla michelsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
