    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
