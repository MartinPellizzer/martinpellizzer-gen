    "intro": "Anthobolus exocarpoides, commonly known as the African star grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its exocarp, the outermost layer of the fruit, is thick and fleshy, which aids in seed dispersal. Anthobolus exocarpoides is often found in open, disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
