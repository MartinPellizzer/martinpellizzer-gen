    "intro": "Araucaria bernieri, commonly known as the Huayna Picchu Araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It belongs to the Araucariaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown. The tree produces unique, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for local communities. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Araucaria bernieri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
