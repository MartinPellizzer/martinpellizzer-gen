    "intro": "Astragalus elatiocarpus, commonly known as the spiked fruit milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus elatiocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitats."
