It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. Its adaptability makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
