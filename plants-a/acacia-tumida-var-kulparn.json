    "intro": "Acacia tumida var. kulparn, commonly known as the kulparn wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Western Australia. It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that are grey-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. The kulparn wattle is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in local ecosystems.",

This variety of acacia is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tumida var. kulparn was mainly introduced to South Australia as a hardy ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. However, it has also been reported to spread into native vegetation, raising concerns about its potential as an invasive species. Its introduction has led to increased interest in its ecological impact and management strategies."
