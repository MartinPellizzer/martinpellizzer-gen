    "intro": "Asteracantha, commonly known as the spurge or Euphorbia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and unique inflorescences called cyathia, which consist of a cup-like structure with reduced flowers. Many species of Asteracantha produce a milky sap that can be toxic or irritant. They are often found in arid or semi-arid regions and are adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes."
