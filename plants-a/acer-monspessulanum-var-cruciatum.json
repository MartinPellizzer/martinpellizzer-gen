    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum var. cruciatum, commonly known as the cross-leaved maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the maple tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique foliage, with leaves that have a cross-shaped pattern of lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.",
