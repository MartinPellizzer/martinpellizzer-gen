    "intro": "Acanthococos hassleri, commonly known as the Hassler's acanthococos, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant. It belongs to the family Acanthococcaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruiting structures. The plant is native to specific regions in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, green leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthococos hassleri is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Cyprus, and the Levant. It is commonly found in rocky coastal areas and cliffs along the shores of these regions. The plant thrives in saline and arid environments, often growing on limestone substrates. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the necessary conditions for its survival. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthococos hassleri was mainly introduced to coastal and brackish water environments in the southeastern United States. It thrives in areas with high salinity and is commonly found in salt marshes and estuaries. This invasive species can outcompete native vegetation, altering the ecological balance of these habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels contribute to its spread. Management efforts focus on controlling its spread through mechanical removal and monitoring."
