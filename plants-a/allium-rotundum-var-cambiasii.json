    "intro": "Allium rotundum var. cambiasii, commonly known as the Persian onion or round leek, is a botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bulbous, rounded base and long, hollow leaves that resemble those of the leek. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in umbels, typical of the Allium genus. Its foliage and bulbs are often used in traditional cuisines for their mild, onion-like flavor. Botanically, it is valued for its adaptability to arid conditions and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
