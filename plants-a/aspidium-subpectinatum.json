    "intro": "Aspidium subpectinatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into numerous small, triangular pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Aspidium subpectinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in aquatic and bog gardens."
