    "intro": "Asperula stricta subsp. monticola, commonly known as the alpine evergreen shrub, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand cold climates."
