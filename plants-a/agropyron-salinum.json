    "intro": "Agropyron salinum, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing degraded lands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects."
