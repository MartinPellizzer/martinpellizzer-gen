This plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated in southern and eastern parts of India. Its native distribution is closely associated with the diverse ecosystems of the Indian subcontinent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus palianus was mainly introduced to new regions for its ornamental value and potential agricultural use. It is native to Africa but has been cultivated in parts of Asia and the Americas. The plant is often grown in gardens and greenhouses due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended spread."
