    "intro": "Arnica celsa, commonly known as mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a robust root system and upright, hairy stems that bear yellow-orange flowers resembling those of the common arnica. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and open slopes at high altitudes. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
