    "intro": "Acmispon multiflorus, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial legume characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. Acmispon multiflorus is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open fields, and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature.",
