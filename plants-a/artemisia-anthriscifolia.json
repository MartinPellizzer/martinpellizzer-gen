    "intro": "Artemisia anthriscifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compound umbels, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its strong, medicinal scent. Artemisia anthriscifolia is often found in woodland margins and grassy areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
