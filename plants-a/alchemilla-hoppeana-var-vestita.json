    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
