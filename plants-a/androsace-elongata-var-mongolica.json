    "intro": "Androsace elongata var. mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian arete, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Mongolia and adjacent areas of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a single umbel at the center of the rosette. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
