    "intro": "Acacia inundata, commonly known as the floodplain acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the floodplains of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stem and bipinnate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular inflorescences, which bloom during the wet season. Acacia inundata is adapted to seasonal flooding and can tolerate waterlogged soils, making it a common species in riparian zones. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia inundata is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. It is commonly found in the fynbos biome, which is characterized by its unique biodiversity and Mediterranean climate. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with estuaries and coastal dunes. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia inundata was mainly introduced to areas with seasonal flooding and nutrient-rich soils, often found in riverine and swampy environments. It is commonly established in disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along waterways. This plant thrives in regions with high water tables and can tolerate prolonged periods of waterlogging. Its introduction has led to its spread in parts of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
