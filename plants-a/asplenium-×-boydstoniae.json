    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 boydstoniae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is a low-growing, epiphytic fern that typically thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds with a distinctive dark green color and a glossy texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
