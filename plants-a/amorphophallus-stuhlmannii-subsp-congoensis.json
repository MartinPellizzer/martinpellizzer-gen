    "intro": "Amorphophallus stuhlmannii subsp. congoensis, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces a tuberous root system that serves as a storage organ and is used as a food source in some regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to regenerate from its underground tubers."
