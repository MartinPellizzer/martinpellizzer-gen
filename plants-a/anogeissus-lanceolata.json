It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has elliptical leaves that are leathery in texture and arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. The species is also known for its ability to thrive in dry, tropical climates and is often found in dry deciduous forests."
