    "intro": "Artemisia succulenta, commonly known as the succulent wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Artemisia succulenta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone, which have been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
