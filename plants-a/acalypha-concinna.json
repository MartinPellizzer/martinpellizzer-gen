    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha concinna is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also known to occur on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Its native range extends to parts of northern Australia as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha concinna was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and ability to spread rapidly. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns in several parts of the world where it has established itself as a weed."
