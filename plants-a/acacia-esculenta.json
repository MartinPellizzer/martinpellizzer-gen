    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia esculenta is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This species is commonly distributed across the savannas and grasslands of the region. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. The plant is also known for its edible pods, which have been used by local communities for food and traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia esculenta was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its edible seeds, which provide a valuable food source in some areas. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it an effective choice for land rehabilitation. However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
