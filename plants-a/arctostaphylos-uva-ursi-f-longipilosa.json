    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi f. longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair bearberry, is a subspecies of the bearberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing shrub form, with evergreen leaves that have a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. Its leaves contain arbutin, a compound with potential medicinal properties. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
