    "intro": "Alectorolophus parviflorus var. rusticulus, commonly known as the rusty-leaved aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinct rust-colored margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and wildflower meadows."
