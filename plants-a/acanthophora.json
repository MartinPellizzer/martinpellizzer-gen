    "intro": "Acanthophora, commonly known as the thorny shield lichen, is a genus of lichens belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose or foliose growth form and is often found on rock surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. The thallus of Acanthophora typically exhibits a dark, leathery texture with distinct, branched, thorn-like structures called rhizines. It forms symbiotic associations with various species of cyanobacteria and fungi, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, Acanthophora is of interest to both lichenologists and ecological researchers."
