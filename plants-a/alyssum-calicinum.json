    "intro": "Alyssum calicinum, commonly known as the California alyssum, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-green, linear leaves and a mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Alyssum calicinum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings."
