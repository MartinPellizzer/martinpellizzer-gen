    "intro": "Asplenium harrisii, commonly known as the Harris's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This species is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes are short and it forms dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in limited spaces. The plant's fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
