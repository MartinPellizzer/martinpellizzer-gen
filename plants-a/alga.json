    "intro": "Alga, commonly known as a type of aquatic plant, encompasses a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms that lack true roots, stems, and leaves. They are found in a variety of habitats, including freshwater, marine, and even moist terrestrial environments. Algae range from single-celled microorganisms to large, multicellular forms, such as seaweed. They play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems by producing a significant portion of Earth's oxygen through photosynthesis. Additionally, algae are a vital food source for many aquatic organisms and are used in various industrial and commercial applications."
