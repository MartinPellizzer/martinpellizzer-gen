    "intro": "Adenocarpus viscosus, commonly known as sticky burr, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which often exude a sticky substance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny, viscid fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grassland or shrubland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts.",
