    "intro": "Antirrhinum caprarium, commonly known as the alpine snapdragon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of red, pink, and yellow. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, due to their shape and color. Antirrhinum caprarium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
