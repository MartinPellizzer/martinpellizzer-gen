    "intro": "Amyema scandens subsp. plicatula, commonly known as the Narrow-leafed Honey Myrtle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers, and it is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils. The subspecies plicatula is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and narrower leaves compared to other forms of Amyema scandens."
