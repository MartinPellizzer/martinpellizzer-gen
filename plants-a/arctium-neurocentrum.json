    "intro": "Arctium neurocentrum, commonly known as the purple burdock. It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple or brown flowers that develop into burrs with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
