    "intro": "Astragalus subconduplicatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Astragalus subconduplicatus is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
