The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
