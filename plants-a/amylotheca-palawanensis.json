    "intro": "Amylotheca palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which forms a tightly adherent layer on the substrate, typically found on rock surfaces in humid tropical environments. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic alga and a fungus, which together form the composite organism. It is endemic to the Palawan region of the Philippines, where it thrives in shaded, moist microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
