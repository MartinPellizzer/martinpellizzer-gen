    "intro": "Alibrexia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly alibrexia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, soft, and hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with elongated leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in panicles, and are typically pink or purple in color. Alibrexia tomentosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas."
