It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats. Alypum glaucescens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or sandy environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
