    "intro": "Alchemilla coriacea, commonly known as stonecrop alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough, slightly hairy texture. Alchemilla coriacea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
