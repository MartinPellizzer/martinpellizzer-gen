    "intro": "Anthriscus rupicola, commonly known as the rock anise, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Anthriscus rupicola is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
