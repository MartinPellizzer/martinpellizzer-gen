    "intro": "Arbutus tessellata, commonly known as the silverleaf madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin, flaky layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark red color. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and have a silvery underside, contributing to its common name. Arbutus tessellata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats."
