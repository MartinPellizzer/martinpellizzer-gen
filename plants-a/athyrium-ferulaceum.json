    "intro": "Athyrium ferulaceum, commonly known as the fern moss or Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. The plant has a unique appearance with its dark green, glossy leaves and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
