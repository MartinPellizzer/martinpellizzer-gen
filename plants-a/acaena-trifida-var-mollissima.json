    "intro": "Acaena trifida var. mollissima, commonly known as the soft burr or velvet bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces distinctive, spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. mollissima is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in agricultural areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. mollissima was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
