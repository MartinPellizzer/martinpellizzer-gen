    "intro": "Aspidium kaulfussii, commonly known as the Kaulfuss's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. Aspidium kaulfussii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
