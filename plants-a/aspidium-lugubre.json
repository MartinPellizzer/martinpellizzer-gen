    "intro": "Aspidium lugubre, commonly known as the mournful fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often described as having a somber appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Aspidium lugubre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
