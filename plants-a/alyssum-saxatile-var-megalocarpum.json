    "intro": "Alyssum saxatile var. megalocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded alpine alyssum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, low-growing foliage with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The plant produces large, elongated seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across rocky and alpine habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine plantings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant flowers and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
