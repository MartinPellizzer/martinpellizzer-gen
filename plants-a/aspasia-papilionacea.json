    "intro": "Aspasia papilionacea, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that resemble small butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Aspasia papilionacea is an important species for local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various small organisms."
