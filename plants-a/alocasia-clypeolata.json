    "intro": "Alocasia clypeolata, commonly known as the \"Cup-shaped Alocasia,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant features a short, stout rhizome and produces striking, pale yellow to white spathes with bright red or orange spadices. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alocasia clypeolata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive indoors with proper care."
