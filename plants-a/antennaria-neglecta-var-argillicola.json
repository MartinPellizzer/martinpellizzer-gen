It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in moist, clayey soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to withstand both drought and frost."
