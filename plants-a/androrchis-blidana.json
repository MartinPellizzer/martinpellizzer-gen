    "intro": "Androrchis blidana, commonly known as the Blidane orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in sunny, open habitats. The plant features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. Its flowers are characterized by a spurred lip and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
