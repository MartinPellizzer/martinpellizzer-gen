    "intro": "Assonia bernieri, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface and a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
