It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species found in coastal and desert regions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Aster salsuginosus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
