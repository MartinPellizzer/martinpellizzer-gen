    "intro": "Aloe forbesii, commonly known as the yellow aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Aloe forbesii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
