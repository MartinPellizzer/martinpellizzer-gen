It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This variety is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is often associated with mixed deciduous and coniferous forests. The plant is known for its striking yellow-variegated leaves, making it a popular ornamental species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum var. aureovariegatum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive yellow-variegated foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and parks where its unique leaf patterns add visual interest. The plant is typically cultivated in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Its introduction has been limited to specific regions where it can thrive without becoming invasive. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely distributed in the wild."
