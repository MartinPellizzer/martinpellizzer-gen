This plant is found in specific regions of Iran, particularly in the northern and central parts of the country. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the dry and harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Iran, making it a regionally significant plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon riyatguelii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often growing along slopes or in disturbed soils. This plant is adapted to low moisture conditions and can thrive in environments with limited rainfall. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its distribution has been expanded through horticultural interest and ecological restoration projects."
