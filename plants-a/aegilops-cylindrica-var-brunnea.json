    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica var. brunnea, commonly known as the dark rye or black rye, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark brown to black\u9896 (glumes) and awns, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its seeds are small and elliptical, with a hard outer coat that aids in seed dispersal. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic improvement in wheat and other cereals."
