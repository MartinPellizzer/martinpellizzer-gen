    "intro": "Acaena oligomera, commonly known as New Zealand burrweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Acaena oligomera plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for native birds and insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena oligomera is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andes mountain range. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often seen in shrublands and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. Acaena oligomera plays an important role in the local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena oligomera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its aggressive growth has led to the displacement of native vegetation in certain regions."
