It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant features alternating leaflets that give it its scientific name, and its leaves are often used in traditional medicine. Anemia alternifolia thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
