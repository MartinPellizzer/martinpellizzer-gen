    "intro": "Alyssoides, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like buttercups and anemones. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Alyssoides thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a common weed and a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators."
