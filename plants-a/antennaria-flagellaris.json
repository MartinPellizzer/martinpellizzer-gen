    "intro": "Antennaria flagellaris, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, silky hairs, which give the plant its common name. Antennaria flagellaris is often found in moist, sandy soils in open habitats such as dunes and coastal areas."
