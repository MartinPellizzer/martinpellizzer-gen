    "intro": "Asclepias ameliae, commonly known as Amelia's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain silky, white fluff, which aids in seed dispersal by the wind. It is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both the larvae and adult insects. Its adaptability to arid environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
