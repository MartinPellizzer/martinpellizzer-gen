    "intro": "Alchemilla rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces upright flowering stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate flowers, as well as its ability to attract beneficial insects."
