    "intro": "Alnus incana var. microjula, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and catkin-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky soils. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic flora and fauna. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed or barren landscapes."
