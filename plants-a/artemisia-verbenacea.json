    "intro": "Artemisia verbenacea, commonly known as blue artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, feathery leaves that release a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Artemisia verbenacea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
