    "intro": "Aira sabulonum var. uniflora, commonly known as the beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, blue-green leaves that are adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces spikelets that bear single flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in saline environments and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
