    "intro": "Acacia rostriformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions. Acacia rostriformis is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize sandy soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia rostriformis is primarily native to Victoria. It is found in the southeastern region of Australia, specifically within the state of Victoria. This species thrives in a variety of habitats, including dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. It is commonly associated with sandy or rocky soils in the coastal and inland areas of Victoria. Acacia rostriformis plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rostriformis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It was also introduced for soil stabilization and erosion control in certain regions. Despite its benefits, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its spread. Management efforts are ongoing to control its impact on local ecosystems."
