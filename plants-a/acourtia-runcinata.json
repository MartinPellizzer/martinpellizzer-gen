    "intro": "Acourtia runcinata, commonly known as the coast needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white to pale blue flowers. It is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Acourtia runcinata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.",
