    "intro": "Attalea spectabilis var. typica, commonly known as the royal palm, is a tall, slender palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 6 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into clustered, edible fruits resembling small dates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used in traditional construction and crafts."
