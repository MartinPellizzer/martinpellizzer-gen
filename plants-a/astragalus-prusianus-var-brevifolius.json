    "intro": "Astragalus prusianus var. brevifolius, commonly known as Prussian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the central and eastern regions of the United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
