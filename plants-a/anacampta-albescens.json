    "intro": "Anacampta albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring. Its flowers are spurred and have a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of orchid morphology. Anacampta albescens is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in rocky crevices and coastal areas."
