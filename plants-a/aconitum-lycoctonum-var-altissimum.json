    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. altissimum, commonly known as the tall monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spires of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, giving it a distinctive and dramatic appearance. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
