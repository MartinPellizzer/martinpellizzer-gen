    "intro": "Anemone coelestina var. truncata, commonly known as the star anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features showy, white to pale blue flowers with a central yellow eye, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are dark green and velvety in texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
