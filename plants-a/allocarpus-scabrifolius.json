    "intro": "Allocarpus scabrifolius, commonly known as the rough-leaved sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, serrated leaves that are covered in a rough, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Allocarpus scabrifolius plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert animals."
