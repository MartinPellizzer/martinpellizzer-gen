    "intro": "Atragene florida, commonly known as the Florida starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Atragene florida plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
