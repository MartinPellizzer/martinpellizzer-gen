It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking spadices, which are often red or orange, surrounded by a showy spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Anthurium firmum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
