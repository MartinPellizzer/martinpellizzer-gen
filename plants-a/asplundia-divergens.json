    "intro": "Asplundia divergens, commonly known as the mountain arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Asplundia divergens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local medicine."
