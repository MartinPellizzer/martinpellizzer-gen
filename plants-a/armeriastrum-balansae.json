    "intro": "Armeriastrum balansae, commonly known as the Balansae sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, which helps it conserve water in dry conditions. Armeriastrum balansae is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native range."
