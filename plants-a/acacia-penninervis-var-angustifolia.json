    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia penninervis var. angustifolia is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, including the states of South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in dune systems and coastal heathlands. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in these regions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Due to its hardy nature, it is also sometimes cultivated in gardens in similar climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia penninervis var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in regions with low rainfall and is commonly found in disturbed soils such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along creek banks. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant in some parts of the world for its distinctive foliage. However, its invasive potential in certain environments requires careful management."
