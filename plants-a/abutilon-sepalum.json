    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon sepalum is primarily native to Pakistan. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the Punjab and Sindh provinces. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open fields and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the local environmental conditions and is sometimes used for ornamental purposes. Its native distribution is largely confined to the Indian subcontinent, with Pakistan being one of its key regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sepalum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is often found growing in gardens and along roadsides. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region."
