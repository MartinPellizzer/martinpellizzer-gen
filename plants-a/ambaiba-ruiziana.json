    "intro": "Ambaiba ruiziana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Ambaiba ruiziana is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in the crafting of musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
