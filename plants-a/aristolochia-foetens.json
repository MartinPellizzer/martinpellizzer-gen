    "intro": "Aristolochia foetens, commonly known as the stinking beggar's-tick, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, vine-like growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a distinctive, fragrant, and often unpleasant-smelling flower that is typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its toxic properties, it is not suitable for cultivation in gardens."
