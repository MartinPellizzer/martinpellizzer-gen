It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
