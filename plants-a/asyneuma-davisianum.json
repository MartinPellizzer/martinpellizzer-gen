It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is native to parts of southern Africa. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy berries. Asyneuma davisianum plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and supporting avian populations."
