It is characterized by its slender, winding stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid and rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
