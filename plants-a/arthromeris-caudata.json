    "intro": "Arthromeris caudata, commonly known as the trailing arum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Arthromeris caudata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care."
