    "intro": "Anemonastrum schrenkianum, commonly known as the Schrenk's sand-verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
