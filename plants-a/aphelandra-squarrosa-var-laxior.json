It is characterized by its striking, elongated, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and warm temperatures. Its foliage is often variegated with shades of green, yellow, and red, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
