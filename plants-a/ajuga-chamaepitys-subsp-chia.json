    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. chia, commonly known as \"Chinese bugleweed,\" is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens."
