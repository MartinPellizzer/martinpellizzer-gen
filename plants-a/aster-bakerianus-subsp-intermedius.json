    "intro": "Aster bakerianus subsp. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple and blue. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
