It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
