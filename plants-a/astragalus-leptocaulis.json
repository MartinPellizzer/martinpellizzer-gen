It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.
