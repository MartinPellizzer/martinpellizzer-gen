    "intro": "Aspidium hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Aspidium hastatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens or as a decorative plant in humid environments."
