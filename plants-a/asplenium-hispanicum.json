    "intro": "Asplenium hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a leathery texture and dark green, glossy leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium hispanicum is relatively low-maintenance and often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
