    "intro": "Aster scaber var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its showy, blue to purple flower heads appear in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments."
