    "intro": "Astragalus subcinereus, commonly known as the grayleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Astragalus subcinereus is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
