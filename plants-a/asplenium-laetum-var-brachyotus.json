    "intro": "Asplenium laetum var. brachyotus, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a perennial fern native to various regions in Europe, including the British Isles. The plant features finely divided, bright green, leathery fronds that are shorter and broader than those of the typical variety. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Asplenium genus."
