    "intro": "Anathallis bleyensis, commonly known as the Bley's spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded understory of the forest. Its flowers are small and pale green, often with a slight reddish tinge, and are pollinated by specific species of flies. Anathallis bleyensis is a rare and endangered species, threatened by habitat loss and deforestation."
