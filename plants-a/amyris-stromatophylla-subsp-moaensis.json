    "intro": "Amyris stromatophylla subsp. moaensis, commonly known as the Maori sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
