It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Anisopoda species are perennial herbs that often have a fibrous root system. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
