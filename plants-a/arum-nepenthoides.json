    "intro": "Arum nepenthoides, commonly known as the pitcher plant of Borneo, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its unique, modified leaves that form pitcher-like structures, which are used to trap and digest insects. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Its habitat is typically in lowland rainforests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Arum nepenthoides is notable for its specialized adaptations that allow it to obtain nutrients from captured prey in nutrient-poor soils."
