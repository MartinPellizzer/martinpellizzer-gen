    "intro": "Abronia micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often found in coastal dunes and other xeric habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia micrantha is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in coastal dune environments and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often associated with maritime hammocks and scrub habitats. It is a low-growing perennial with small, white to pinkish flowers. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia micrantha was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, typically in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant is adapted to withstand periods of drought and salt spray, making it suitable for coastal habitats. It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. Its introduction has been largely unintentional, often through human activities such as transportation or landscaping."
