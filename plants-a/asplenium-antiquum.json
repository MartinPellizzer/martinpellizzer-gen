    "intro": "Asplenium antiquum, commonly known as the ancient spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium antiquum is noted for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
