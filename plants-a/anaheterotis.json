    "intro": "Anaheterotis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellow in color. Anaheterotis is native to regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
