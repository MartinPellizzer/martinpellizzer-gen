    "intro": "Avena viridis, commonly known as green oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Avena viridis is often found in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp, fertile soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
