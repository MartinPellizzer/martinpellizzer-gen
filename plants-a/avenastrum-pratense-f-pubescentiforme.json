    "intro": "Avenastrum pratense f. pubescentiforme, commonly known as the pubescent-form fern, is a botanical variant of the common fern Avenastrum pratense. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical form of the species. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually lanceolate or linear, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat."
