    "intro": "Armeria elongata subsp. alpina, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in tight, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
