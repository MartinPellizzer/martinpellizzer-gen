    "intro": "Arabis harrisonii, commonly known as Harrison's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Arabis harrisonii is often found in meadows and on slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
