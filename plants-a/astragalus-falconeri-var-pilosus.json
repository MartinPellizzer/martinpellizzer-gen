    "intro": "Astragalus falconeri var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy falconer's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its sparsely branched stems and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
