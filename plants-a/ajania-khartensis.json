    "intro": "Ajania khartensis, commonly known as the Sudan ajania, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Sudan. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Ajania khartensis produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
