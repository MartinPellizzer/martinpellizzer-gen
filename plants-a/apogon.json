    "intro": "Apogon, commonly known as the goatfish, is a type of marine fish belonging to the family Apogonidae. While not a plant, it is often confused with botanical terms due to its name. The name \"apogon\" is derived from the Greek words \"apo\" meaning away and \"gonos\" meaning offspring, possibly referring to its reproductive habits. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive coloration. These fish are typically found in coastal waters and are known for their unique spawning behaviors."
