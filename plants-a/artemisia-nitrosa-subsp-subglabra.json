    "intro": "Artemisia nitrosa subsp. subglabra, commonly known as silverleaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in loose, flat-topped arrays. Its leaves are lance-shaped, aromatic, and often have a strong, camphor-like scent. This subspecies is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy plant in dry, well-drained soils."
