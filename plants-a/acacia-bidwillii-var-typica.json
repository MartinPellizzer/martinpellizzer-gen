    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia bidwillii var. typica is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. This variety is commonly found in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of these environments. It is often seen growing in shrublands and along riverbanks in these areas. The plant is well-known for its distinctive, flat, bipinnate leaves and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia bidwillii var. typica was mainly introduced to regions with dry, warm climates, particularly in parts of Australia and the Mediterranean. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
