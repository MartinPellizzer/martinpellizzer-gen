    "intro": "Alsine gussonii, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments, making it a typical member of the Chenopodiaceae family. Its seedlings often emerge after rainfall, and the species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system. Alsine gussonii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
