    "intro": "Asplenium erectum var. lobatum, commonly known as the broad-lobed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are dark green and have a leathery texture, with distinctive lobed margins that give it its common name."
