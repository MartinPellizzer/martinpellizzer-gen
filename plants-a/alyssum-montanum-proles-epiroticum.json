    "intro": "Alyssum montanum proles epiroticum, commonly known as the Epirus alpine alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Greece. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
