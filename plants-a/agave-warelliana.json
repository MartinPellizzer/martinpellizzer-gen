    "intro": "Agave warelliana, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small greenish-white flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, requiring minimal water and well-drained soil. Agave warelliana is widely cultivated for its use in producing tequila and other agave-based spirits."
