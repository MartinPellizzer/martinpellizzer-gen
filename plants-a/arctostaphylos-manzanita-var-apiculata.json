    "intro": "Arctostaphylos manzanita var. apiculata, commonly known as the coastal manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its bark is typically reddish-brown and peels in thin, papery layers, a feature common among manzanita species. This variety is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
