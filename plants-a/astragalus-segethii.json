It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind or animals."
