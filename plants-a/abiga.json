    "intro": "Abiga, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture, adapting to its humid, shady habitat. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf burn. Abiga is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to bloom year-round under proper care."
