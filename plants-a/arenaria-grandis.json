    "intro": "Arenaria grandis, commonly known as the large sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Arenaria grandis is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
