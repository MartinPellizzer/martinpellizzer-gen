    "intro": "Anathallis amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
