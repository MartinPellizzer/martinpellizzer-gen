    "intro": "Andropogon corassipes, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, tufted manner at the base. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairies, wetlands, and disturbed areas. Switchgrass is known for its ability to thrive in full sun and its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. It is also a valuable species for erosion control and is increasingly used as a bioenergy crop."
