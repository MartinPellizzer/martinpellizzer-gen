It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by small, three-angled seeds. Axonopus laegaardii is adapted to sandy or well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its hardy nature."
