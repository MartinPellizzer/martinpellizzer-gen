    "intro": "Acrostichum stipitatum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of fine roots, which help anchor it in the soil. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance.",
