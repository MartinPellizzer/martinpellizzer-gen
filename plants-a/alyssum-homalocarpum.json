    "intro": "Alyssum homalocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has gray-green, hairy leaves that are narrow and linear, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum homalocarpum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
