    "intro": "Asplenium arborescens, commonly known as the tree spleenwort, is a fern that typically grows on tree trunks and branches in shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its erect, branching fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like growth. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to the bark of trees, allowing it to thrive in epiphytic conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Asplenium arborescens is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
