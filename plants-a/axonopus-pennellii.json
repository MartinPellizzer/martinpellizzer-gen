    "intro": "Axonopus pennellii, commonly known as the carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form thick mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and have a slightly hairy texture. Axonopus pennellii is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability. It is also used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds."
