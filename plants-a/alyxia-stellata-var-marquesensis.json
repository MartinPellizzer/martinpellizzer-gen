    "intro": "Alyxia stellata var. marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan starvine, is a climbing plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in clusters. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that turns red when mature, attracting various bird species. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its unique floral structure and habitat preferences."
