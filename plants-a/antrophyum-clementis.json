    "intro": "Antrophyum clementis, commonly known as the Clement's antrophyum, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Antrophyum clementis is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
