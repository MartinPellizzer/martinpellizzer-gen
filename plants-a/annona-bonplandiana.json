    "intro": "Annona bonplandiana, commonly known as the bonplandian custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 3\u20135 meters. The plant produces large, showy white flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attract pollinators like flies and beetles. Its fruit is a yellowish-green, spiny berry that ripens to a golden color and is edible when mature. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
