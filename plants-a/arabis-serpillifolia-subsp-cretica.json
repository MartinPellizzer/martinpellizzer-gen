    "intro": "Arabis serpillifolia subsp. cretica, commonly known as Cretan rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Crete. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on slopes or cliffs, where it thrives in full sun. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
