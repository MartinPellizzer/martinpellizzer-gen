    "intro": "Alchemilla conglomerata, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal, waxy, and spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Alchemilla conglomerata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
