    "intro": "Arenaria aristata, commonly known as the spiked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenaria aristata is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
