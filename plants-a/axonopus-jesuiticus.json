    "intro": "Axonopus jesuiticus, commonly known as the Jesuit's grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a dense rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Axonopus jesuiticus is also valued for its ornamental appeal in certain landscaping applications."
