    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tracheliifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or along stream banks. It is also native to parts of India and Indonesia, where it grows in similar environmental conditions. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tracheliifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value. The plant has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have led to its establishment in some natural areas. However, it is generally not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated."
