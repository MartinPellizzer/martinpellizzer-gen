    "intro": "Anthyllis alpicola subsp. cherleri, commonly known as the alpine anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It has small, narrow leaves and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
