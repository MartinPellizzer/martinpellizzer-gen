    "intro": "Astragalus hypsogenus, commonly known as the highland milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Astragalus hypsogenus plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
