    "intro": "Acaena stellaris, commonly known as the star burr, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, spiky fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a hairy, prickly husk. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Acaena stellaris is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it contributes to local biodiversity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena stellaris is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions and alpine areas. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open vegetation or on slopes. It is part of the native flora of the New Zealand's subalpine and alpine zones. Acaena stellaris is known for its distinctive star-shaped flowers and is an important component of the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena stellaris was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive star-shaped flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity."
