It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and often reddish in color. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, flat-topped heads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds."
