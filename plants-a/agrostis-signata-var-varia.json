    "intro": "Agrostis signata var. varia, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny spikelets. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
