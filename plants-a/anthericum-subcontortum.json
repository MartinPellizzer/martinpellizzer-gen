    "intro": "Anthericum subcontortum, commonly known as the twisted yellow flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear narrow, sword-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green hue. Its most notable feature is the showy, yellowish-green inflorescence composed of small, clustered flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found near water bodies."
