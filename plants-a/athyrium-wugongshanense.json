    "intro": "Athyrium wugongshanense, commonly known as the Wugongshan fern, is a rare species native to China. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in humid climates. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are often curled into a fiddlehead shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
