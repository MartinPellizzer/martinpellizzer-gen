    "intro": "Asplenium heterodon, commonly known as the heterodon spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Asplenium heterodon is a relatively rare species, with a limited geographic distribution primarily in temperate regions."
