    "intro": "Artocarpus integer, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces a unique fruit that is typically harvested when it is still unripe and starchy, resembling a bread-like texture when cooked. Its leaves are large, alternate, and have a glossy green surface with a rough texture. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for both its edible fruit and ornamental value."
