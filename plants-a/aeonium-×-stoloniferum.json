    "intro": "Aeonium \u00d7 stoloniferum, commonly known as the \"Tree Aeonium,\" is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces offsets and stolons, which allow it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. Aeonium \u00d7 stoloniferum is popular in rock gardens and as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
