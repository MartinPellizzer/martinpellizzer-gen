It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas with high humidity. Its intricate frond structure consists of multiple radiating pinnae, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs.
