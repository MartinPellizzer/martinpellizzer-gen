    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium f. villosissimum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrasses, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves. It is native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. The silky texture of its foliage is due to the presence of fine, soft hairs covering the leaves and stems."
