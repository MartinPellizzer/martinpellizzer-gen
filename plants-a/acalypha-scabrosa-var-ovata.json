    "intro": "Acalypha scabrosa var. ovata, commonly known as velvetleaf or smoothleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy leaves that are typically ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which are not particularly showy. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with multiple stems and a tendency to branch profusely. The plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha scabrosa var. ovata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha scabrosa var. ovata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first brought to these regions in the late 19th century by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking to diversify local plant collections. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the warm, humid conditions of the Pacific Islands. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into natural habitats."
