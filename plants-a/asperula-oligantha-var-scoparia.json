    "intro": "Asperula oligantha var. scoparia, commonly known as the Alpine azalea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a compact shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces vivid pink to red blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the showy flowers. Asperula oligantha var. scoparia thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
