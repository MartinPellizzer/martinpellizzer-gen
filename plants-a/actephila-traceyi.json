    "intro": "Actephila traceyi, commonly known as the Sierra Madre dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic plant.",
