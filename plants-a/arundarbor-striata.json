    "intro": "Arundarbor striata, commonly known as the striped orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers that display a unique striped pattern on their petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming season typically occurs during the rainy season, adding vibrant color to the forest understory. Arundarbor striata is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
