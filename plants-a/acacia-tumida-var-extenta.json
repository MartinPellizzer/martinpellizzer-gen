    "intro": "Acacia tumida var. extenta, commonly known as the broad-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping.",

It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of the region. The plant is commonly seen in coastal and inland areas, including parts of the Nullarbor Plain. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic species of the region's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tumida var. extenta was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or well-drained soils. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate drought and salty conditions, making it adaptable to various environments. It is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some areas where it competes with native vegetation."
