    "intro": "Ardisia purpureovillosa, commonly known as the purple-hair ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive purple-tinged underside, and its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
