    "intro": "Androsace tibetica var. kurramensis, commonly known as the Kurram Androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid mountain habitat. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
