    "intro": "Angraecum hermannii, commonly known as Hermann's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has a unique adaptation called a \"candle\" stem, which allows it to store water and nutrients during dry periods. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
