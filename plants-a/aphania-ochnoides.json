    "intro": "Aphania ochnoides, commonly known as the African snowball, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of white, fluffy flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in late winter to early spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Aphania ochnoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils."
