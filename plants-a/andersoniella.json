    "intro": "Andersoniella, commonly known as the Anderson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its botanical features include narrow, strap-like leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in the late afternoon. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andersoniella is considered a critically endangered species."
