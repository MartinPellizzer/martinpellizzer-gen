    "intro": "Aristea repens, commonly known as the creeping aristea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
