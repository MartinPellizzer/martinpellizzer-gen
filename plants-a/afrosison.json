    "intro": "Afrosison, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers and thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture. Afrosison species typically grow as compact shrubs or herbs, often with a rosette-like arrangement of foliage. They thrive in well-drained soil and require bright, indirect light to flourish. The genus includes several species, such as Afrosison capense and Afrosison tenuifolium, which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
