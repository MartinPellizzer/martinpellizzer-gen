    "intro": "Ardisia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved beautyberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including China, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, violet-blue berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ardisia microphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and seasonal fruit display."
