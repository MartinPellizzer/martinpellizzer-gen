    "intro": "Asplenium cataractarum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often resemble a lace-like pattern. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates in its natural habitat. Asplenium cataractarum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
