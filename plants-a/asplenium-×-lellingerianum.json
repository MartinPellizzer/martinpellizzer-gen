    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 lellingerianum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a distinctive dark green color and a slightly curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not commonly found in the wild."
