    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. montevidense, commonly known as the Montevideo holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern native to South America. It is a perennial fern characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features bipinnate leaves with a distinctive, serrated edge and a dark green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
