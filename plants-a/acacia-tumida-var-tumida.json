    "intro": "Acacia tumida var. tumida, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in soft, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are encased in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.",
