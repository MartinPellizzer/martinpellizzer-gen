    "intro": "Argyrocome margarethae, commonly known as the silverleaf margaret, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
