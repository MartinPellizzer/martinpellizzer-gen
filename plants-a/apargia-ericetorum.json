    "intro": "Apargia ericetorum, commonly known as the heath twayblade, is a small perennial herb native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flower spike. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and pine barrens. Its flowers, which are usually greenish-yellow, bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Apargia ericetorum is a relatively rare and specialized plant, often found in specific ecological niches."
