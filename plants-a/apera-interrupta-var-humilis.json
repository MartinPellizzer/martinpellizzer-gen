    "intro": "Apera interrupta var. humilis, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in height, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
