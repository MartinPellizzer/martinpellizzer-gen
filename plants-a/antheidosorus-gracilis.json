    "intro": "Antheidosorus gracilis, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Antheidosorus gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
