    "intro": "Aspidium pringleanum, commonly known as the Pringle's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium pringleanum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
