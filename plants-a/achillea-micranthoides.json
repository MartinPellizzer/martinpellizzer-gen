    "intro": "Achillea micranthoides, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are narrow and linear, with a grayish-green coloration due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic foliage and extended blooming period make it a valuable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes.",
