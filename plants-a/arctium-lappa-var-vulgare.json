    "intro": "Arctium lappa var. vulgare, commonly known as common burdock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces purple or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are thick, fleshy, and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
