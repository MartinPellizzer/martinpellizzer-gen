    "intro": "Aechmea bracteata, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from pink to red, adding visual interest to its foliage. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and gas exchange. Aechmea bracteata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal."
