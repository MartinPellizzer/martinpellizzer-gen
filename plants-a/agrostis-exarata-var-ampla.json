    "intro": "Agrostis exarata var. ampla, commonly known as the broadleaf silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
