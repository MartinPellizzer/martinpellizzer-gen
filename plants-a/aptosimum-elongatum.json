    "intro": "Aptosimum elongatum, commonly known as the slender sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its structure includes a basal rosette of leaves with elongated, linear lobes, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Aptosimum elongatum is often found in maritime ecosystems and is an important part of the local flora in its habitat."
