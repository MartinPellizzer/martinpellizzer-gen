It is characterized by its small, flat, pea-like fruits that are typically harvested when dry. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in spring, and its leaves are simple and alternate. The fruit contains a single hard seed, which is the primary part used for propagation. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
