    "intro": "Acacia subflexuosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flower spikes during the autumn and winter seasons, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Acacia subflexuosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subflexuosa is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia subflexuosa plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the diverse flora of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subflexuosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the eastern parts of the country, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing along the edges of forests and in open woodlands. Its introduction has led to its spread along the eastern coast, where it is now considered a potential invasive species. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a significant part of the local vegetation in these areas."
