    "intro": "Adonis aestivalis var. flava, commonly known as the golden belladonna, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care.",
