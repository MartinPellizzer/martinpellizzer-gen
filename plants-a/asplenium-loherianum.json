    "intro": "Asplenium loherianum, commonly known as the Loher's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the western United States. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium loherianum is well adapted to humid, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
