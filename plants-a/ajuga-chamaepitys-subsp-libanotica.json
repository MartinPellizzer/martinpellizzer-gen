    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanese bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a dense carpet of foliage."
