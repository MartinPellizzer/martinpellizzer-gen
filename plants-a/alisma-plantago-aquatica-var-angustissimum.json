    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a wetland plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that grow close to the water's surface. It typically has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Alisma plantago-aquatica."
