    "intro": "Allium arvense subsp. aestivum, commonly known as summer garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that bears small, umbel-like clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often mistaken for true garlic bulbs, though they are less pungent and more fibrous. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ornamental gardens and ecological restoration projects."
