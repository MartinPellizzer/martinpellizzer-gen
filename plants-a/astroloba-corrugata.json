It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage composed of thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green with a distinctive waxy coating, and they often have a rippled or corrugated texture. It produces tall, spiky flower spikes that bear small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
