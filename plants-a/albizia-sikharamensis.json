    "intro": "Albizia sikharamensis, commonly known as the Indian silk tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant produces fragrant, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open to release the seeds. Albizia sikharamensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic qualities in gardens."
