    "intro": "Anacolosa poilanei, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath, which aids in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
