It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. This cultivar is valued for its compact growth habit and long blooming period, making it a popular choice for borders and containers. However, it requires well-drained soil and regular watering to maintain its health and vigor. Its introduction has expanded the range of Abelia species available for horticultural use in diverse garden settings."
