It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually arranged in spikes, followed by small, three-lobed seeds. It plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in marshes, along rivers, and in coastal areas."
