    "intro": "Astragalus safavii, commonly known as Persian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, featuring deep roots and reduced leaves to minimize water loss. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
