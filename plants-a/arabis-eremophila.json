    "intro": "Arabis eremophila, commonly known as the desert rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats to conserve moisture and reduce heat stress. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to store water, and its flowers are borne on slender stems. Arabis eremophila is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
