    "intro": "Asplenium hemionitis var. hemionitis, commonly known as the silver spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray fronds. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, linear pinnae that give it a delicate appearance. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
