    "intro": "Adenopetalum gramineum, commonly known as the grassy adenopetalum, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides, and it thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often mistaken for grass due to its narrow, linear leaves, but it produces distinctive composite flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Adenopetalum gramineum is also noted for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions.",
