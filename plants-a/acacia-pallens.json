    "intro": "Acacia pallens, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are encased in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals. Acacia pallens is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pallens is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the northern and central parts of the country, including the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrublands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its ability to store water in its thick, waxy leaves. Acacia pallens plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pallens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in fynbos vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it has spread to other areas outside its native range. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
