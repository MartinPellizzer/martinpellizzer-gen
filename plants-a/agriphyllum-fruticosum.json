    "intro": "Agriphyllum fruticosum, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Agriphyllum fruticosum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
