    "intro": "Auxopus kamerunensis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Cameroon mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Cameroon. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
