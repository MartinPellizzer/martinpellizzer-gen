    "intro": "Alopecurus pronus, commonly known as the bentgrass or narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Alopecurus pronus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
