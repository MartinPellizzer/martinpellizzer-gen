    "intro": "Alnus languinosa, commonly known as the slender alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical trunk and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks. Alnus languinosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
