    "intro": "Astragalus phaciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seed pods are typically slender and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus phaciformis is adapted to dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
