    "intro": "Astragalus maris-mortui, commonly known as the sea death's-head, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. Astragalus maris-mortui is adapted to saline and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats near the shore. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
