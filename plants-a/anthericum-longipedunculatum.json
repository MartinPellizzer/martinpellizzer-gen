    "intro": "Anthericum longipedunculatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, arranged in a loose panicle on long, slender peduncles. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
