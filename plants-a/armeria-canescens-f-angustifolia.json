It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The species is a popular choice for xeriscaping because of its low water requirements and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
