    "intro": "Anserina muralis, commonly known as the wall rue, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or wall crevices, thriving in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a delicate, arching frond that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months. Anserina muralis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its ability to colonize difficult sites."
