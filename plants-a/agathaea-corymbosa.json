    "intro": "Agathaea corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered agathis, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense, rounded canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in corymbs, followed by oblong, leathery fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface with a strong, spicy aroma. Agathaea corymbosa is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
