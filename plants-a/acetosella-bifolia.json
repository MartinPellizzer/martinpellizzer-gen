    "intro": "Acetosella bifolia, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often hairy and have a tangy, acidic taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.
