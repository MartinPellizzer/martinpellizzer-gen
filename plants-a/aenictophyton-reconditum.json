It belongs to the order Filicales, characterized by its vascular system and spore-producing reproductive structures. The plant exhibits a complex frond morphology with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a serrated margin that aids in water retention. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a relict species, offering insights into prehistoric plant evolution."
