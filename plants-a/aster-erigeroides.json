    "intro": "Aster erigeroides, commonly known as the hairy aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Its showy, daisy-like flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, producing purple to pink petals. Aster erigeroides is often found in moist woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
