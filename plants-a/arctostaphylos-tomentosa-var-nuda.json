    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa var. nuda, commonly known as the naked bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically hairless, distinguishing it from its hairy counterpart, A. tomentosa. The plant produces red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
