    "intro": "Achasma megalocheilos, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its harsh, arid environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Achasma megalocheilos is considered an endangered species.",
