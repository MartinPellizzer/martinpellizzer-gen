    "intro": "Aspidium inaequale, commonly known as the unequal wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds that are often asymmetrical, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Aspidium inaequale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
