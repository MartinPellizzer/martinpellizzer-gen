It features dense, evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and seasonal floral display."
