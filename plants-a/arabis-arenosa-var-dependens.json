    "intro": "Arabis arenosa var. dependens, commonly known as the sandstone rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high winds and limited water availability. This species is often found growing on rocky slopes, gravelly soils, and in coastal areas."
