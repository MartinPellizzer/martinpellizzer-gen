It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound, trifoliate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in dry, calcareous soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
