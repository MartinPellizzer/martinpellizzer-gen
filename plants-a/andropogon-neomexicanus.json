    "intro": "Andropogon neomexicanus, commonly known as New Mexico panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, typically growing in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system. Andropogon neomexicanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
