    "intro": "Aconitum orientale var. coloratum, commonly known as the Chinese aconite or the blue aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
