    "intro": "Atriplex lithophila, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is adapted to harsh environments, featuring small, salt-tolerant leaves that reduce water loss. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish or yellowish in color. Atriplex lithophila plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
