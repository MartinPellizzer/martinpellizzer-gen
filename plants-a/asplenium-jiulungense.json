    "intro": "Asplenium jiulungense, commonly known as the Jiulung spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium jiulungense is native to China and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
