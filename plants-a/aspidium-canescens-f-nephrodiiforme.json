    "intro": "Aspidium canescens f. nephrodiiforme, commonly known as the kidney-shaped fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, kidney-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually light green and have a slightly hairy surface, which gives it a unique texture. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
