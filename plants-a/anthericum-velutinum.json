    "intro": "Anthericum velutinum, commonly known as velvet fern, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, leathery, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Asparagaceae family."
