    "intro": "Asplenium auricularium var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is characterized by its compact growth and distinctive, ear-like appearance of its young fronds."
