    "intro": "Asparagus sarmaticus, commonly known as the Sarmatian asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its stout, cylindrical stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles, which are followed by edible, needle-like young shoots. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Asparagus sarmaticus is valued for its culinary use, particularly in Eastern European cuisine, where the tender shoots are harvested and consumed as a vegetable."
