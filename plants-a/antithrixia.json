    "intro": "Antithrixia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their silver-white undersides on their leaves, which give them their common name. Antithrixia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white. The genus includes several species, with Antithrixia umbellata being one of the most well-known."
