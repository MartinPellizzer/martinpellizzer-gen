    "intro": "Acorus macrospadiceus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia. It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces yellowish-green spadices, which are the male flowers, followed by green, spadix-like female flowers. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties. Acorus macrospadiceus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.",
