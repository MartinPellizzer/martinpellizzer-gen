    "intro": "Avena coronensis, commonly known as the crowned oat, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its flowers are typically greenish or brownish, with a distinctive crown-like appearance at the base of the spike. Avena coronensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and resilience."
