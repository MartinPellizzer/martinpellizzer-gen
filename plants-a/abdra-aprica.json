    "intro": "Abdra aprica, commonly known as the golden sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Abdra aprica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abdra aprica is primarily native to Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, and South Carolina. This plant is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it can receive adequate sunlight. The species is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of these states. Its native range reflects its preference for temperate and humid environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abdra aprica was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Mediterranean region due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. It has been observed thriving in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it outcompetes native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to its establishment in several non-native areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to become invasive. Despite its benefits in horticulture, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent ecological disruption."
