It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for trellises and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
