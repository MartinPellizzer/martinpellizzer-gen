    "intro": "Adenophora verticillata lusus alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features basal leaves that are alternate in arrangement, often with a hairy texture, and stems that are typically hairy as well. The plant produces showy bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late summer. Its flowers are clustered in loose racemes, and the plant is often found in moist, shady woodland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.",
