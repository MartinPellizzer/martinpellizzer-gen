It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-bearing inflorescences. Anthotium species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique foliage and exotic appearance. They thrive in moist, well-drained soil and require indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
