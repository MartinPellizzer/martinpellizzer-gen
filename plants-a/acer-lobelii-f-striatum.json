It is characterized by its unique, striped bark that displays alternating light and dark bands, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, with a vivid green color that turns yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in forest understories. This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty landscapes.",
