    "intro": "Adipera submontana, commonly known as the mountain adipera, is a herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Adipera submontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens.",
