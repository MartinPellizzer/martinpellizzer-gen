    "intro": "Arethusa bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features showy, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. The plant has broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. Arethusa bengalensis plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat."
