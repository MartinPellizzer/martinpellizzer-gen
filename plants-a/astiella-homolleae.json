It belongs to the family Trapeliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure. The plant forms a crustose or foliose growth on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites, which contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
