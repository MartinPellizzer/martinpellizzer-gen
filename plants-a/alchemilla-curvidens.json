    "intro": "Alchemilla curvidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Alchemilla curvidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
