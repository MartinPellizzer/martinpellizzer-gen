    "intro": "Astragalus montanus var. tegetarius, commonly known as the Sierra lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows, often in areas with poor soil. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
