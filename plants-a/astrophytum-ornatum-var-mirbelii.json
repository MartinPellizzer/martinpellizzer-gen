    "intro": "Astrophytum ornatum var. mirbelii, commonly known as the Mirbel's moon cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, flattened stem that resembles a top, often with a colorful, non-photosynthetic cap. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The varietal form, mirbelii, is distinguished by its specific growth patterns and coloration compared to the base species."
