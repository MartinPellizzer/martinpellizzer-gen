    "intro": "Androsace refracta, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. Androsace refracta thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or subalpine habitats."
