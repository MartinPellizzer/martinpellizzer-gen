    "intro": "Alisma superbum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration in aquatic environments. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to fluctuating water levels."
