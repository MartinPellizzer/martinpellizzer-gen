    "intro": "Andropogon epiphyllus, commonly known as the bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, composed of tightly packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon epiphyllus is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
