    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthostemma rumphii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. It is commonly found in the tropical regions of the country, including the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthostemma rumphii was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and gardening. It is often found in disturbed soils and areas with moderate to high light exposure. The plant has shown adaptability to various environmental conditions, contributing to its spread. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, impacting local ecosystems."
