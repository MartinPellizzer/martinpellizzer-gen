    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 rajbhandarii, commonly known as the Rajbhandari's spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits from its parent species, Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth texture, with sporangia clustered along the undersides of the leaves. This hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability in high-altitude environments."
