    "intro": "Aechmea turbinocalyx, commonly known as the Turbinated Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant's foliage is often adorned with vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues, adding to its ornamental appeal. It produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear showy, long-lasting bracts in shades of red or orange. Aechmea turbinocalyx thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity to flourish."
