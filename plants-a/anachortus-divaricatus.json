    "intro": "Anachortus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, making it an important component of certain ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
