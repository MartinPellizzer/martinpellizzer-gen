    "intro": "Ajuga parviflora, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage that is typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Ajuga parviflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ground cover landscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form thick, lush carpets."
