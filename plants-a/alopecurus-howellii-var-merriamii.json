    "intro": "Alopecurus howellii var. merriamii, commonly known as Howell's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
