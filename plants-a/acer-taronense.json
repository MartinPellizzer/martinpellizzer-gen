    "intro": "Acer taronense, commonly known as the Taronese maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.",
