    "intro": "Abies mariesii f. hayachinensis, commonly known as the Hayachinensis fir, is a rare and ornamental variant of the white fir. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical species. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies mariesii f. hayachinensis is primarily native to the Japanese islands of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. This subspecies is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, particularly in the northern and central parts of Honshu. It grows in cool, moist environments at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mixed forests with other coniferous species. It is an important component of the temperate rainforest ecosystems in Japan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies mariesii f. hayachinensis was mainly introduced to Japan. It is a variant of the Japanese fir, known for its unique foliage and ornamental value. The introduction of this plant has been primarily for horticultural purposes in gardens and landscaped areas. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal. However, its spread beyond cultivation has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
