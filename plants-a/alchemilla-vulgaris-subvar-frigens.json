It features a dense mat of silver-green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
