    "intro": "Aquilegia flava, commonly known as the yellow columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which consist of two rows of showy, spurred petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with compound leaves that are palmately divided into five to seven lobes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The yellow columbine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also an important nectar source for pollinators."
