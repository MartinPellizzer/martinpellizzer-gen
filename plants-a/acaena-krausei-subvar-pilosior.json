    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena krausei subvar. pilosior is primarily native to South America, specifically in regions of Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate to subantarctic areas of these countries. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is part of the Rosaceae family and is known for its hardy and drought-resistant characteristics. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena krausei subvar. pilosior was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a decorative plant due to its attractive, fuzzy foliage and small flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly problematic in grasslands and shrublands. Its aggressive growth can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances."
