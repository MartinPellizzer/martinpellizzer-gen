    "intro": "Athyrium plantagineum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with clustered, compound leaves that have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators."
