    "intro": "Arenaria pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, adapting to harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and sandy habitats."
