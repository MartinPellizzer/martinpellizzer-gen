It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a pod-like fruit, and the plant is often found in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
