    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn almond or sticky alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are found on the same tree. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. This species is valued for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful for soil stabilization and reforestation efforts."
