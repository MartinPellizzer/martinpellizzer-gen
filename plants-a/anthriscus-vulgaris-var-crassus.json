It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant has a hollow, ridged stem and is often mistaken for other members of the parsley family. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable species in its native habitat."
