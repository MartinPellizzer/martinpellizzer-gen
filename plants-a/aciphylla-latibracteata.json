    "intro": "Aciphylla latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract snowgrass, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure with silver-gray foliage that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which provide insulation against cold temperatures. Aciphylla latibracteata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat.",
