It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy purple or white flowers bloom in the late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster simplex is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
