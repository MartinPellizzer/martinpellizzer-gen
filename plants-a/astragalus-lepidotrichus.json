    "intro": "Astragalus lepidotrichus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves with numerous small, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus lepidotrichus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
