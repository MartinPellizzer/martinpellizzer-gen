    "intro": "Artemisia spicata subsp. eriantha, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on dry slopes and in disturbed soils. Its aromatic compounds make it both ecologically significant and potentially useful in traditional herbal medicine."
