    "intro": "Angelica schishiudo, commonly known as the giant angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a complex umbel, which eventually develop into oval, dry fruits. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its aromatic roots and stems, which are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
