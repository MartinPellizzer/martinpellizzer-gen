    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha baenitzii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or secondary vegetation. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia, where it grows in open habitats. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in cultivated areas near its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha baenitzii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it is cultivated for decorative purposes. The plant has been reported in several countries, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into native ecosystems."
