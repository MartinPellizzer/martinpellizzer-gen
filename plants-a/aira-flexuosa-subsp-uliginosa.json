    "intro": "Aira flexuosa subsp. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marsh habitats. It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs and other moist environments. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
