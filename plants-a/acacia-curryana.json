    "intro": "Acacia curryana, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Acacia curryana is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",

This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of its native habitat. Acacia curryana plays an important ecological role in the local flora of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia curryana was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and open woodlands. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuel. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in certain ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it has become naturalized in several areas beyond its original range."
