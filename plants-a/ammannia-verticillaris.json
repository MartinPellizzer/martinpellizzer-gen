    "intro": "Ammannia verticillaris, commonly known as the whorled ammannia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshes of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that form a whorl at the nodes. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often submerged, and it thrives in shallow water or moist soil. Ammannia verticillaris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
