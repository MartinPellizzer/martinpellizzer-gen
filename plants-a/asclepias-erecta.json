It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bright orange to red flowers. The plant has a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture. Asclepias erecta serves as a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and is an important component of native pollinator habitats."
