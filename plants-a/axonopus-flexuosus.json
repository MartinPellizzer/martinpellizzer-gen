    "intro": "Axonopus flexuosus, commonly known as the flexible axonopus, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Axonopus flexuosus is used in landscaping for its dense, carpet-like appearance and its ability to suppress weeds."
