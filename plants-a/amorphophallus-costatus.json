    "intro": "Amorphophallus costatus, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces a massive, spiky inflorescence that resembles a phallus, hence its scientific name. It thrives in wet, humid environments and is often found in rainforests. The plant is notable for its rapid growth and ability to store energy in its underground tuber, allowing it to survive periods of drought."
