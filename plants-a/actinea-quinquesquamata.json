It is characterized by its five distinct arms, each with a unique arrangement of radial plates and ambulacral grooves. The body is covered in a calcareous endoskeleton, providing structural support and protection. It inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found in rocky substrates. This species plays a vital role in marine ecosystems by controlling prey populations and contributing to nutrient cycling.",
