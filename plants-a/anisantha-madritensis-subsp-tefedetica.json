    "intro": "Anisantha madritensis subsp. tefedetica, commonly known as the Andean marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments such as wetlands and mountain meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which helps stabilize soil in its native habitat. It is often found in association with other alpine flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
