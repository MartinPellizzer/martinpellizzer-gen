    "intro": "Agropyron stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Agropyron stewartii is valued for its hardiness and is used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
