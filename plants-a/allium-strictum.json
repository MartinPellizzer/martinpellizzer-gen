    "intro": "Allium strictum, commonly known as the slender leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, cylindrical flower stalks that bear small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, garlic-like scent, which is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Allium strictum is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
