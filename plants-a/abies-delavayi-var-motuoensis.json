    "intro": "Abies delavayi var. motuoensis, commonly known as the Motuo fir, is a rare and endemic conifer found in the high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, oval cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

This rare coniferous species is found in the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas, particularly in the Motuo area. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant is adapted to the rugged and mountainous terrain of the region. Its limited distribution makes it a unique and ecologically significant species in Tibetan biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies delavayi var. motuoensis was mainly introduced to the regions of Yunnan and Sichuan in China, where it thrives in high-altitude mountainous areas. It is commonly found in the Motuo Valley, a remote and ecologically significant area. This variety is known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to the local climate. It plays an important role in the local biodiversity and forest ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions."
