    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a robust root system and tall, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its varietal name \"puberulum.\" Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. However, like all aconites, it contains potent toxins and should be handled with care.",
