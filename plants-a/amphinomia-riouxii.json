    "intro": "Amphinomia riouxii, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rock-dwelling growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, intricate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with purple markings, adapted for specific pollinators. It is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils, where it forms dense clumps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphinomia riouxii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
