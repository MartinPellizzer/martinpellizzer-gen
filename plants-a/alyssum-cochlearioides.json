It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.
