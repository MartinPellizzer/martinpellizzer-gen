    "intro": "Arachis hypogaea, commonly known as the peanut, is an annual legume native to South America. It is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves, with small white to pink flowers that develop into pods underground. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root system. Its seeds, which are actually the edible part, are rich in protein, healthy fats, and various nutrients. The unique growth habit of the peanut, where the flowers bend downward to form the pod beneath the soil, is a key botanical feature of this plant."
