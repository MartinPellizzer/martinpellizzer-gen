    "intro": "Anarrhinum arabicum, commonly known as the Arabian sand thorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a member of the Zygophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and spiny, thorny stems. The plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically small and succulent, helping it retain moisture in low-water conditions. Anarrhinum arabicum is often found in desert and semi-desert ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
