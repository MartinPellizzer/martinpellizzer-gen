    "intro": "Agrostis montis-aurei, commonly known as the mountain gold grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that reflects its adaptation to high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle golden hue to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
