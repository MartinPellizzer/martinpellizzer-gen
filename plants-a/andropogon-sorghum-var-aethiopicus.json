    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. aethiopicus, commonly known as African millet, is a grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in drought-prone regions. This variety is valued for its hardiness and potential use in both forage and grain production."
