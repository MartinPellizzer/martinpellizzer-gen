    "intro": "Adiantum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are characterized by their slender, arching appearance and the presence of tiny, translucent glands along the leaf margins. Adiantum microphyllum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting.",
