    "intro": "Arum triphyllum var. zebrinum, commonly known as the zebra plant or zebra arum, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves with a zebra-like pattern of dark green and white stripes. Native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a showy, colorful spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance. It requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight to flourish."
