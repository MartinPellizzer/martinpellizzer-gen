    "intro": "Antitoxicum stauropolitanum, commonly known as the Starlight Shield, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Stauropolis Mountains. It is characterized by its bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, with a silver underside that reflects light, aiding in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Its root system is highly complex, forming a dense network that helps stabilize the soil in its rocky habitat. The plant contains compounds believed to have detoxifying properties, which has led to its use in traditional medicine."
