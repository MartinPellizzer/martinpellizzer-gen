    "intro": "Asplenium sulcatum var. recognitum, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a variant of the common shield fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often curled fronds that give it a unique appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
