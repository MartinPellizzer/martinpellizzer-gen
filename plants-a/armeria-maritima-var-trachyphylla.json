    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. trachyphylla, commonly known as sea thrift, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in harsh coastal environments. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
