    "intro": "Aster ciliatus, commonly known as the silky aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Aster ciliatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
