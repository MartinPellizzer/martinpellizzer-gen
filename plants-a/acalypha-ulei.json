    "intro": "Acalypha ulei, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian nettle, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to the plant's foliage. Acalypha ulei is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha ulei is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas. It is also known to occur in some parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is closely linked to regions with high rainfall and warm temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ulei was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation have led to its establishment in some non-native areas. However, it is not considered highly invasive in most regions where it is introduced."
