    "intro": "Aspidium dentatum, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium dentatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
