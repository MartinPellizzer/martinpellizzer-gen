    "intro": "Austrostipa pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Austrostipa pubescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
