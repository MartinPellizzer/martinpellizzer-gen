    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. legionensis, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it often forms dense mats that stabilize coastal dunes. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in horticulture."
