    "intro": "Aster dumosus var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slenderleaf woodland aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
