    "intro": "Angraecum campyloplectron, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a prominent central spur. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by moths, which are attracted to the nectar stored in the elongated spur. Angraecum campyloplectron is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
