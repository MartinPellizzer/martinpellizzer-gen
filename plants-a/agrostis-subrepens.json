    "intro": "Agrostis subrepens, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Agrostis subrepens is also a common component of lawns and meadows, contributing to biodiversity in these habitats."
