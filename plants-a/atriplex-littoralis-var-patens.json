It is adapted to saline and arid environments, with small, salt-excreting leaves that help it thrive in coastal soils. The plant has a compact growth habit with branching stems that are often covered in a powdery coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for wildlife."
