    "intro": "Andropogon flabellifer, commonly known as the bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of tiny, red-brown flowers that resemble a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Andropogon flabellifer plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
