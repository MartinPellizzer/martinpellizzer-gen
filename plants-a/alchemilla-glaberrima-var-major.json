    "intro": "Alchemilla glaberrima var. major, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, open inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
