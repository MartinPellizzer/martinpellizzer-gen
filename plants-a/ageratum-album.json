    "intro": "Ageratum album, commonly known as white ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its fluffy, white or pale blue flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 36 inches and has hairy, gray-green foliage. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its botanical name, *Ageratum houstonianum* var. *album*, reflects its classification within the sunflower family, Asteraceae."
