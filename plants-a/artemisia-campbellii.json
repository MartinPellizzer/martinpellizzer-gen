    "intro": "Artemisia campbellii, commonly known as Campbell's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Artemisia campbellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
