    "intro": "Aphanactis macdonaldii, commonly known as the Macdonald's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, often with a slight pinkish hue. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem and produces a single flower per inflorescence, which blooms during the late winter to early spring season. Aphanactis macdonaldii is a terrestrial orchid, growing in shaded, moist environments with rich, organic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is protected under Australian environmental laws."
