    "intro": "Aglaia argentea var. superba, commonly known as silver flame tree or white flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that emit a metallic sheen when exposed to light. The tree produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round, orange fruits. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and showy inflorescences. The plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a shade tree in tropical regions."
