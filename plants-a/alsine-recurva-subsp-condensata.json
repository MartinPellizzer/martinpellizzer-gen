    "intro": "Alsine recurva subsp. condensata, commonly known as the dense alsike, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or along the edges of wetlands. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a dense rosette, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
