    "intro": "Albuca granulata, commonly known as the granulate albuca, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Albuca granulata is relatively low maintenance and drought-tolerant once established."
