    "intro": "Astragalus procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It typically forms dense mats of slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus procumbens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in open habitats like prairies and disturbed areas."
