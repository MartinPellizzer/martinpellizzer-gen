    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon mendoncae is primarily native to Mexico. It is found in the states of Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Michoac\u00e1n. This species typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments. It is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mendoncae was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its unique, lantern-shaped flowers and attractive foliage. This plant thrives in coastal and Mediterranean climates, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native habitats."
