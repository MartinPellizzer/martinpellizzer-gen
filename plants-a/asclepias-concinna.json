    "intro": "Asclepias concinna, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic sap, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive reddish or purple underside. Asclepias concinna is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects."
