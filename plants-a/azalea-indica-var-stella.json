    "intro": "Azalea indica var. stella, commonly known as the star azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to bloom multiple times throughout the growing season."
