    "intro": "Anoda polygyna, commonly known as the plains morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies and roadsides. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped blue to violet flowers that bloom in the morning. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Anoda polygyna is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
