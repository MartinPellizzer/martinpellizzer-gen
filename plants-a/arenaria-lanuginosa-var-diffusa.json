    "intro": "Arenaria lanuginosa var. diffusa, commonly known as the hairy sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems are adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. This variant is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
