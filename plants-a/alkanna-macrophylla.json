    "intro": "Alkanna macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf alkanna, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its roots produce a reddish pigment used in traditional dyes and natural cosmetics. Alkanna macrophylla thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions."
