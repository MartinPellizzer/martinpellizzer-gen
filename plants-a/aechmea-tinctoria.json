    "intro": "Aechmea tinctoria, commonly known as the crimson bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that encase the inflorescence, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central pool used for attracting pollinators. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, greenish-white blooms. Aechmea tinctoria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments."
