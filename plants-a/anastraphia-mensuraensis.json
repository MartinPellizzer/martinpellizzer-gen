    "intro": "Anastraphia mensuraensis, commonly known as the Southern Highlands orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited habitat and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species."
