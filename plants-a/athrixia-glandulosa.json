    "intro": "Athrixia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular thimbleweed, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in small, glandular dots. Its flowering stems produce clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are surrounded by bracts. Athrixia glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
