    "intro": "Azukia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf azukia, is a flowering plant species native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, lens-shaped pods. Azukia heterophylla is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its adaptability to different light conditions makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
