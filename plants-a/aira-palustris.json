    "intro": "Aira palustris, commonly known as bog airplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and grass-green, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
