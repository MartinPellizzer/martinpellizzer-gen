    "intro": "Axonopus perlongus, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has fine, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture, making it popular in ornamental horticulture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and wetland areas. Its dense growth habit makes it effective for erosion control and ground cover."
