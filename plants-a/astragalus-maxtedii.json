    "intro": "Astragalus maxtedii, commonly known as the Maxted's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus maxtedii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native pollinators."
