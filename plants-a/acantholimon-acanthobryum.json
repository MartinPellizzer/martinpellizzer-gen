    "intro": "Acantholimon acanthobryum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial species belonging to the family Montiaceae, characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at higher altitudes. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates typical of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon acanthobryum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure, often found in mountainous or coastal areas. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, construction areas, and quarries. Its introduction has been documented in several regions across the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. Due to its hardy nature, it can spread rapidly and may become invasive in certain ecosystems."
