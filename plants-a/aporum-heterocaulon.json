    "intro": "Aporum heterocaulon, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has long, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking feature in wetland environments. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving water and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally through the substrate, allowing it to colonize large areas. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
