    "intro": "Allium pikeanum, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It features a bulb composed of numerous small, white, ovoid cloves encased in a papery skin. The plant produces tall, grass-like leaves and clusters of pale pink to purple flowers during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
