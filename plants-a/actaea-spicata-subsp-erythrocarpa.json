    "intro": "Actaea spicata subsp. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited bugbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems that bear large, white to pale pink, clustered flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its bright red, berry-like fruits that remain on the plant well into the winter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's ornamental value comes from its striking floral display and persistent fruiting structure.",
