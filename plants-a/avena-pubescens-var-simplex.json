It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
