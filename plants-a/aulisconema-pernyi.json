    "intro": "Aulisconema pernyi, commonly known as the Perny's aulisconema, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of other umbelliferous plants. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
