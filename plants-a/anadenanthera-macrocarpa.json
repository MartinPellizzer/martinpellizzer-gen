    "intro": "Anadenanthera macrocarpa, commonly known as the \"Bottle Tree,\" is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its unique swollen trunk that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The tree produces large, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Its leaves are palmate, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. The plant also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
