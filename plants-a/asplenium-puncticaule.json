    "intro": "Asplenium puncticaule, commonly known as the spotted spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a distinctive pattern of small, dark spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a layer of moss-like growth. Asplenium puncticaule is a primitive fern with a simple reproductive structure, producing spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds."
