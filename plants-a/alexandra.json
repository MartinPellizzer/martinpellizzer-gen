    "intro": "Alexandra, commonly known as the Alexandra fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a subtle silvery sheen. Native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, this plant thrives in shady, moist environments. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky or forested substrates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add a touch of elegance to shaded garden spaces."
