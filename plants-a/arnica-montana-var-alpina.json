It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its medicinal properties, it is sometimes harvested for use in topical treatments, though it is often protected in its natural habitat."
