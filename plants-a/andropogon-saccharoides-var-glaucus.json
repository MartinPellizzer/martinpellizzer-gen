It features narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered with a fine, waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in prairie and woodland habitats. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
