It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical name reflects its association with the genus Anemone and its distinctive sulfur-yellow coloration."
