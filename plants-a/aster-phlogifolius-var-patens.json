    "intro": "Aster phlogifolius var. patens, commonly known as the spreading aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color. Its flowering period usually occurs from September to November, making it a valuable late-season nectar source for pollinators. The variety 'patens' is distinguished by its more spreading growth habit compared to other varieties of Aster phlogifolius."
