It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are typically tubular at the base and flare out into a bell shape, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
