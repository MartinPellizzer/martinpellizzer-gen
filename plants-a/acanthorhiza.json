It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky bracts that surround the flower cluster, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments. Its leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the flowers are small and white or pale yellow. Acanthorhiza plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine life."
