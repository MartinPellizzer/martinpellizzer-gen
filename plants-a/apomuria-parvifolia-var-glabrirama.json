    "intro": "Apomuria parvifolia var. glabrirama, commonly known as the smoothleaf apomuria, is a rare variant of the apomuria parvifolia species. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from other varieties. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
