    "intro": "Armeria villosa, commonly known as seaside thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture and withstand salty sea air. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Armeria villosa is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
