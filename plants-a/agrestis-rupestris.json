    "intro": "Agrestis rupestris, commonly known as the rock agrestis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
