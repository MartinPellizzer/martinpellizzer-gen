    "intro": "Aspidium cognatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams, ponds, or in damp woodlands. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium cognatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and soil conditions."
