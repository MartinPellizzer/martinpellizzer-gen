    "intro": "Amsonia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluemink, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue to violet flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in prairies, open woods, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is drought-tolerant once established. Amsonia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators."
