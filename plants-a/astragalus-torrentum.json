    "intro": "Astragalus torrentum, commonly known as the torrent milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often found along stream banks and in alpine meadows. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus torrentum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
