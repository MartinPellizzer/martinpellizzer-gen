    "intro": "Androsace baltistanica, commonly known as the Baltistan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Androsace baltistanica is often found in meadows and on mountain slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
