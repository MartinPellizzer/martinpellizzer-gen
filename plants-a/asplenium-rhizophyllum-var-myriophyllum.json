    "intro": "Asplenium rhizophyllum var. myriophyllum, commonly known as the water fern, is a variety of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green with a glossy appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in damp woodlands or near water sources. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
