    "intro": "Arachis diogoi f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf groundnut, is a botanical variant of the groundnut species native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded pods compared to the typical groundnut. The plant produces edible seeds that are rich in protein and oil, making it a valuable crop in certain regions. Its botanical features include trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers typical of the Fabaceae family. Due to its unique morphology, it is often studied for its potential in agricultural and genetic research."
