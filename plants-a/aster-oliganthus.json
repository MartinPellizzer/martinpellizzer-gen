    "intro": "Aster oliganthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue to violet, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aster oliganthus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
