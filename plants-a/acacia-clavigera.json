    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia clavigera is primarily native to eastern Australia, including New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and heathlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy habitats. It is also present in parts of Victoria and South Australia. Acacia clavigera is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is an important plant in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia clavigera was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate climate, typically found in regions with moderate rainfall. It thrives in open woodlands and grasslands, where it can receive ample sunlight. This plant is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal environments. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Australia and New Zealand. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation and erosion control projects."
