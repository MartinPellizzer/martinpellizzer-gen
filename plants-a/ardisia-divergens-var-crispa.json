    "intro": "Ardisia divergens var. crispa, commonly known as the crisped evergreen ardisia, is a compact shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are slightly curled or crinkled, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its attractive foliage and seasonal berries contribute to its value in both landscape design and conservation efforts."
