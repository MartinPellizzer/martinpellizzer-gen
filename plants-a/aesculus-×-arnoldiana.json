    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 arnoldiana, commonly known as the horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets and its showy, white or pinkish flowers that appear in panicles during late spring. The tree produces spiny, capsule-like fruits containing one or more chestnuts. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in parks and gardens. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree can grow up to 25 meters tall."
