    "intro": "Allium azureum, commonly known as the blue onion or azure leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to onions, which are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and culinary potential, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for both aesthetic and edible purposes."
