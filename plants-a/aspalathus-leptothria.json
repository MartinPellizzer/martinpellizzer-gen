    "intro": "Aspalathus leptothria, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is closely related to other rooibos species and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Its botanical features make it distinct from other members of the Fabaceae family."
