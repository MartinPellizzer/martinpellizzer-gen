    "intro": "Aster bellis, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, daisy-like flowers. It typically blooms in early spring and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and gardens. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with hairy stems that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and they attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Aster bellis is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it has been introduced to many other regions around the world."
