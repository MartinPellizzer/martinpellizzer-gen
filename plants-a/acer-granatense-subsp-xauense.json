    "intro": "Acer granatense subsp. xauense, commonly known as the Xauense maple, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.",
