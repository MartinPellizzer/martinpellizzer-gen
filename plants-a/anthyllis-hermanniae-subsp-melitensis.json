    "intro": "Anthyllis hermanniae subsp. melitensis, commonly known as the Maltese broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Malta and parts of Sicily. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and sunny environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is well adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
