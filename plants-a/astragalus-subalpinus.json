    "intro": "Astragalus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in late summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Astragalus subalpinus is often found in meadows and grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
