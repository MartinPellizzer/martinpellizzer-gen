    "intro": "Allium moly var. bulbilliferum, commonly known as the giant garlic or bulbil-bearing garlic, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, bulbous stem and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers in umbels, which are often followed by the development of bulbils\u2014small, vegetative propagules that can grow into new plants. These bulbils are an important feature for propagation and are used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses in some regions."
