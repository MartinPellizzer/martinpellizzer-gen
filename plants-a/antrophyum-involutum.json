    "intro": "Antrophyum involutum, commonly known as the curled antrophyum, is a rare and striking member of the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that curl inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, clustered arrangement of small, spadix-like flowers, which are typically yellowish-green in color. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
