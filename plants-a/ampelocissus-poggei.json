    "intro": "Ampelocissus poggei, commonly known as the African fig or climbing fig, is a vigorous vine native to southern Africa. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy choice for tropical and subtropical gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it useful for covering trellises or creating living fences."
