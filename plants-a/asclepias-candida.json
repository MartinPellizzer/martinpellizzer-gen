    "intro": "Asclepias candida, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and pairs of opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias candida is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a crucial role in supporting pollinators. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the monarch's defense mechanism."
