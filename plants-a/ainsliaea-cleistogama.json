    "intro": "Ainsliaea cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous ainsliaea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinating and often remain hidden within the plant's foliage. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on reproductive biology and plant adaptation."
