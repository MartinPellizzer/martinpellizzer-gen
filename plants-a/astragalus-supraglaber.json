    "intro": "Astragalus supraglaber, commonly known as the smooth milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Astragalus supraglaber plays a role in soil stabilization and is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants."
