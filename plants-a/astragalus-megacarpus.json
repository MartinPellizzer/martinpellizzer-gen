    "intro": "Astragalus megacarpus, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a hardy plant adapted to harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by inflated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep moisture sources, which contributes to its survival in drought conditions. Astragalus megacarpus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
