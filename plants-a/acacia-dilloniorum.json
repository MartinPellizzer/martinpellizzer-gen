    "intro": "Acacia dilloniorum, commonly known as the Dillon's wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Acacia dilloniorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia dilloniorum is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the coastal regions of the state, particularly in the south-western area. This species thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal heathlands and dunes. It is a hardy shrub that can withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Acacia dilloniorum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dilloniorum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions with low rainfall. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can thrive in open, sunny conditions. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to establish quickly. It has also been introduced to some parts of the United States and Australia as an ornamental and for its nitrogen-fixing properties. However, its invasive potential in non-native regions requires careful management."
