    "intro": "Agave flaccifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically narrow and blue-gray in color. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by small, white berries. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave flaccifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
