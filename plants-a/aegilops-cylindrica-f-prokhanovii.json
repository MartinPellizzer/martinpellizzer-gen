    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica f. prokhanovii, commonly known as the prokhanovii form, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat and its ecological resilience."
