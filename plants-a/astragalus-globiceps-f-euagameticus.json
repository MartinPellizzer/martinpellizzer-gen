    "intro": "Astragalus globiceps f. euagameticus, commonly known as the European globular milkvetch, is a rare botanical variant of the Astragalus genus. It is characterized by its globular, clustered growth habit and small, yellowish flowers. This subspecies is notable for its reduced fertility, a trait that may be linked to its specific ecological niche. It typically thrives in dry, calcareous soils in southern Europe. Due to its limited distribution and unique reproductive features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
