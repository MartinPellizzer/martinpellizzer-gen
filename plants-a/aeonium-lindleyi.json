    "intro": "Aeonium lindleyi, commonly known as the Orange Tree Aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a distinctive orange or reddish hue along the edges. The plant produces striking orange or red flowers on tall, branched stems during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Aeonium lindleyi is relatively low maintenance and drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
