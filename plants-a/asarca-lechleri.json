    "intro": "Asarca lechleri, commonly known as *dragon's blood tree*, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and dense canopy of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces a dark red resin, often referred to as \"dragon's blood,\" which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a dye. This resin is collected by making incisions in the bark, leading to the exudation of the sticky substance. The plant thrives in humid, lowland tropical environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
