    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astellia richardi, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its unique, feathery foliage that resembles a fern. The plant features long, arching leaves with a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. Astelia richardi is typically found in coastal and forested areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low-maintenance once established."
