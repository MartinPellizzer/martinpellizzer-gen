    "intro": "Azolla decomposita, commonly known as the decomposing water fern, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Azollaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a dense mat on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has a unique symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which contributes to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective bioindicator of eutrophic conditions. Azolla decomposita is also notable for its role in bioremediation due to its capacity to absorb heavy metals and other pollutants."
