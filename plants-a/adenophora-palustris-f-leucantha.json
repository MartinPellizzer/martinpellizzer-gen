    "intro": "Adenophora palustris f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that are predominantly white, with a subtle pink or purple hue at the base. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, setting it apart from the typical blue or purple-flowered forms of the species.",
