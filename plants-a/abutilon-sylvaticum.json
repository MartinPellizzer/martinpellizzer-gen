    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon sylvaticum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with forest understories and disturbed sites like roadsides and clearings. Its distribution is also extended to parts of the Caribbean islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sylvaticum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers and fuzzy leaves. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its original range, particularly in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate partial shade, which contributes to its successful establishment. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
