    "intro": "Anathallis brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It grows on trees and has a distinctive appearance with pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant has a short, slender stem and produces small, fragrant blooms during the summer months. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered."
