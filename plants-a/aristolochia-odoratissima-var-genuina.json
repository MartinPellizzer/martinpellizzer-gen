    "intro": "Aristolochia odoratissima var. genuina, commonly known as the fragrant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but should be consumed with caution due to the presence of aristolochic acids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique floral structure and fragrance make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
