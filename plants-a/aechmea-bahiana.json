    "intro": "Aechmea bahiana, commonly known as the Bahian velvet plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are usually red or orange, emerging from the leaf axils in a showy display. Aechmea bahiana thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical forests."
