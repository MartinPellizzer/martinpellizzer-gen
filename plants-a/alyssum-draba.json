    "intro": "Alyssum draba, commonly known as rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically has dark green, succulent leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Alyssum draba is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
