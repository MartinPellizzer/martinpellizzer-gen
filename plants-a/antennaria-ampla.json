    "intro": "Antennaria ampla, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy stems and lobed or heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Antennaria ampla is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
