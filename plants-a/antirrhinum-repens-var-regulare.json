    "intro": "Antirrhinum repens var. regulare, commonly known as the creeping snapdragon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender stems that spread along the ground, producing clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with two lips, and are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature."
