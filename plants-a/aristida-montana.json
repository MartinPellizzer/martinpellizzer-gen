    "intro": "Aristida montana, commonly known as mountain dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 centimeters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, fluffy flowers that are wind-pollinated. Aristida montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
