    "intro": "Arabis huetii, commonly known as the Huet's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arabis huetii produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
