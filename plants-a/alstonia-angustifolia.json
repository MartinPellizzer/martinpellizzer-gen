    "intro": "Alstonia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alstonia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Alstonia angustifolia is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses. It has also been studied for its potential pharmacological properties."
