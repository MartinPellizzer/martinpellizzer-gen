    "intro": "Apodanthera undulata, commonly known as the undulating sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Apodanthera undulata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
