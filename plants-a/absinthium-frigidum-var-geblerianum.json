    "intro": "Absinthium frigidum var. geblerianum, commonly known as the alpine wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to high-altitude conditions and cold climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium frigidum var. geblerianum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly associated with arid and semi-arid regions. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level. Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological conditions that support its growth in these remote and rugged areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium frigidum var. geblerianum was mainly introduced to regions with cold, moist environments, particularly in the northern hemisphere. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats where the climate is cool and the soil is well-drained. This variant is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and parts of Asia. Its introduction to these regions is largely due to its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions. It has been noted for its medicinal properties and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic foliage."
