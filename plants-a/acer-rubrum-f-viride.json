    "intro": "Acer rubrum f. viride, commonly known as the green maple, is a variant of the red maple tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. This cultivar exhibits leaves that remain a vibrant green throughout the growing season, unlike the typical red or orange of the species. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. While it shares the same genus as the common red maple, its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.",
