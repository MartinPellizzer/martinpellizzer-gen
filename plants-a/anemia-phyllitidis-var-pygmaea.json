    "intro": "Anemia phyllitidis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the pygmy liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or in damp soil. Its structure consists of a thallus with a central axis and lateral branches, typical of many liverworts. Anemia phyllitidis var. pygmaea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
