    "intro": "Austroplenckia, commonly known as the New Zealand bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plants typically grow in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Austroplenckia species are often found in rocky or sandy habitats, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat loss, some species are considered threatened, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
