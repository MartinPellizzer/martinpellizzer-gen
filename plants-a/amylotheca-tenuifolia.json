    "intro": "Amylotheca tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in South America. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy habitats. Amylotheca tenuifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
