    "intro": "Archidendron ptenopum, commonly known as the African wisteria, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
