    "intro": "Astragalus candicans, commonly known as the shining milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are typically dispersed by wind. Astragalus candicans is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
