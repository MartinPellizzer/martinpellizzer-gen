    "intro": "Asclepias mellodora var. minor, commonly known as the lesser milkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the milkweed family, Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. This variety is less common than its larger counterpart, Asclepias mellodora, and is valued for its role in supporting pollinators like butterflies."
