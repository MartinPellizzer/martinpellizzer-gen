It features dense, rounded clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a dramatic visual impact to gardens. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that form a basal rosette, contributing to its elegant appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant.
