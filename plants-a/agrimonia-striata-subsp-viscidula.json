    "intro": "Agrimonia striata subsp. viscidula, commonly known as sticky agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, often glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges and a sticky surface due to the presence of glandular trichomes. This subspecies is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
