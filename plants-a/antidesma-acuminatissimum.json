    "intro": "Antidesma acuminatissimum, commonly known as the African starfruit or sour sop, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, green to greyish bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by yellow, fleshy fruits that resemble starfruits in appearance. The fruit is edible, with a sweet and sour taste, and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. It also has medicinal uses in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
