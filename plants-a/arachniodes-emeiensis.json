    "intro": "Arachniodes emeiensis, commonly known as the Emei Mountain spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lacy fronds that resemble spider webs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This rare and visually striking plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance in its native habitat."
