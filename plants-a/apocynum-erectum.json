    "intro": "Apocynum erectum, commonly known as dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores. Apocynum erectum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including fields and woodland edges."
