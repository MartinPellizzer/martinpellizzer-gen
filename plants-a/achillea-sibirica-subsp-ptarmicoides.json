    "intro": "Achillea sibirica subsp. ptarmicoides, commonly known as Siberian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, branched stems that grow up to 60 cm tall, adorned with basal and alternate leaves that are gray-green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and alpine meadows, and is adapted to cold climates. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.",
