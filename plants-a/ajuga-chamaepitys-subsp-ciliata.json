    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the curly-leaved bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with dark green, ovate leaves that have finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive, velvety texture. Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. ciliata is well-suited for rock gardens and shaded areas due to its compact form and ornamental foliage."
