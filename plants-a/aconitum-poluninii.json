    "intro": "Aconitum poluninii, commonly known as the Polunin's aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat palmate appearance. Aconitum poluninii contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
