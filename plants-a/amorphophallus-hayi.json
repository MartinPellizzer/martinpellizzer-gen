    "intro": "Amorphophallus hayi, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant's flowers are typically pale yellow or white, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts insect pollinators. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizome is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
