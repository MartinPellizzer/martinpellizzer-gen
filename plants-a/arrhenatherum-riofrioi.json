    "intro": "Arrhenatherum riofrioi, commonly known as the Rio Friol grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
