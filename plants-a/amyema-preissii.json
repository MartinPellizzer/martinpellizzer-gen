It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in spring, often around Christmas time, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Amyema preissii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and seasonal flowering."
