    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum, commonly known as the sticky seed plant, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is known for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seed adheres to the fur or feathers of animals. The plant's small, fleshy seeds are covered in a sticky substance that helps them attach to passing animals. It typically parasitizes the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a minor role in ecosystem dynamics but is of interest in botanical studies."
