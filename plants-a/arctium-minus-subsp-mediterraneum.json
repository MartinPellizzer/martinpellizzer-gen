    "intro": "Arctium minus subsp. mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean burdock, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in coarse, hairy texture. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a wavy margin and a thick, fibrous texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, bur-like fruit that contains several seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
