    "intro": "Alyssum lepidulum subsp. congregatum, commonly known as clustered alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada in California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
