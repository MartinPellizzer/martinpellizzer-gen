    "intro": "Acantholimon bromifolium var. bromifolium, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It is well adapted to salty and windy conditions, making it a characteristic species of coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dune soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.",

This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. The species is well adapted to the dry and hot climate of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones in Iran and Iraq.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bromifolium var. bromifolium was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to cold climates, particularly in mountainous areas. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is typically found in areas with low precipitation and high solar exposure. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
