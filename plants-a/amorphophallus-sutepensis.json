    "intro": "Amorphophallus sutepensis, commonly known as the Thai giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which are typically floating on the surface of still water. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped flowers that are often surrounded by a colorful spathe, resembling a dramatic theatrical mask. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
