    "intro": "Andropogon decipiens var. cloncurrensis, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in a loose, open panicle. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
