    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 paniculatum subsp. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the lacecap aconite, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in a dense, spiky inflorescence. The plant produces distinctive, egg-shaped, hairy fruits that mature to a dark brown color. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers partial to full shade in moist, cool environments. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",
