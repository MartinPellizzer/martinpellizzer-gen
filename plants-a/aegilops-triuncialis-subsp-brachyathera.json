    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis subsp. brachyathera, commonly known as the short awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces spikelets that are typically short and awned, with the awns being shorter than those of the main species. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in ecological systems."
