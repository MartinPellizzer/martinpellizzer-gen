    "intro": "Ambrosia media, commonly known as common ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is known for its allergenic pollen, which can trigger hay fever in sensitive individuals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Ambrosia media is an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native plants and reducing biodiversity."
