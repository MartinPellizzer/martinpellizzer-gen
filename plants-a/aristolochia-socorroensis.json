    "intro": "Aristolochia socorroensis, commonly known as Socorro Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo archipelago. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and striking, purple-tinged flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex chemical composition, including various aristolochic acids. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
