It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, arranged in a single bloom atop a hairy stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a soft, fuzzy texture, and are usually basal in arrangement.
