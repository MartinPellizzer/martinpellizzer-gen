    "intro": "Asplenium heterolobum, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rosette-like growth pattern, with the fronds arranged in a compact, circular form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. The leaves are usually dimorphic, with the upper surface being darker and more leathery compared to the lighter, more delicate underside."
