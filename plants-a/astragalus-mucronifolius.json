It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves with a distinctive narrow, pointed shape. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus mucronifolius is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
