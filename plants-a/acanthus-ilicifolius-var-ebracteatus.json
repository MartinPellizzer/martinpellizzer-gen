    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus ilicifolius var. ebracteatus is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia. This variety thrives in rocky coastal areas and dry, sunny environments. It is commonly found in regions such as southern France, Spain, Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula. The plant is well adapted to coastal conditions and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific microhabitats of the Mediterranean climate.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus ilicifolius var. ebracteatus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is often used in garden design to add visual interest and texture to both formal and informal garden settings. This plant is favored for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its tolerance to a range of environmental conditions. However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly. Its introduction has expanded its presence beyond its native range, contributing to its popularity in cultivated landscapes."
