    "intro": "Aspasia lyrata, commonly known as the lyreleaf sedge, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often a striking green or bluish-green color. Aspasia lyrata typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wetland indicator species and its use in ecological restoration projects."
