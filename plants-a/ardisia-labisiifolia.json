    "intro": "Ardisia labisiifolia, commonly known as the glossy ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal berries."
