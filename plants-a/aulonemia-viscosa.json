    "intro": "Aulonemia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky aulonemia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early spring. Its sticky secretions are a notable botanical feature, serving as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. Aulonemia viscosa thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
