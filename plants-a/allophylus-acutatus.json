    "intro": "Allophylus acutatus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a cup-like structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are three-angled capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Allophylus acutatus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas."
