    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 bittyuense, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese painted fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium nipponicum and Athyrium filipendulum. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that display a striking combination of green, silver, and sometimes red hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
