    "intro": "Atractocarpa, commonly known as the \"honeycomb tree,\" is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, honeycomb-like seed pods that split open when mature. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the tree can grow to a moderate height, making it suitable for ornamental cultivation. Atractocarpa is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its historical use in traditional medicine."
