    "intro": "Arenaria rosei, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. Arenaria rosei plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous landscapes."
