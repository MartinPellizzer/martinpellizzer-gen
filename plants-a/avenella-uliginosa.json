    "intro": "Avenella uliginosa, commonly known as bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-sided spikes of pale brown flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Avenella uliginosa plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
