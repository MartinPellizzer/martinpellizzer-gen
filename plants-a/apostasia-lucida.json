    "intro": "Apostasia lucida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its white, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, strap-like leaves and produces a single flower spike with several blooms. Due to its habitat specificity and conservation status, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
