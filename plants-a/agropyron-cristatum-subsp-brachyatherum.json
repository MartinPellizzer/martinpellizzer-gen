    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. brachyatherum, commonly known as the shortawned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold, arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact inflorescence that resembles a crown, giving it its species name \"cristatum.\" The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and withstanding drought and cold temperatures. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
