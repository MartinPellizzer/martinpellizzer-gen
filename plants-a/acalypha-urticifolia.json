    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha urticifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of India, particularly in the southern and eastern regions. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It is commonly found in wetlands, riverbanks, and areas with high humidity. Its native distribution includes regions with rich biodiversity and diverse ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha urticifolia was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural areas. The plant spreads through its prolific seed production and can form dense stands that outcompete native vegetation. It is considered an invasive species in several parts of the world, including the Caribbean and parts of Africa. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a significant ecological concern in many regions."
