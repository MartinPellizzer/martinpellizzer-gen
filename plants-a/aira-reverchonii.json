    "intro": "Aira reverchonii, commonly known as the mountain air grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
