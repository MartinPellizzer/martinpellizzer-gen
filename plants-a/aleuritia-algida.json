    "intro": "Aleuritia algida, commonly known as the snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Aleuritia algida thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
