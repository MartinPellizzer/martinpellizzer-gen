    "intro": "Amphiblemma riparium, commonly known as the water bladdernut, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and riparian zones. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, enhancing its ability to retain moisture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Amphiblemma riparium thrives in moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline ecosystems."
