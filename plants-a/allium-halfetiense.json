    "intro": "Allium halfetiense, commonly known as the Kashmir garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the high altitudes of the Kashmir region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered bulbs underground. It is valued for its culinary use, similar to other Allium species, and is also appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental qualities. Due to its habitat in mountainous regions, it is relatively rare and requires specific growing conditions to thrive."
