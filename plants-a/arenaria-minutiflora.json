    "intro": "Arenaria minutiflora, commonly known as the sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy habitats of the western United States. It produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has dense, mat-forming foliage with tiny, rounded leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is well adapted to poor soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and delicate flowers make it an attractive addition to alpine and coastal landscapes."
