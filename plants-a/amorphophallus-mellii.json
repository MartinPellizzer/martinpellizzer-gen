    "intro": "Amorphophallus mellii, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces a massive, spadix-like inflorescence that can grow up to 3 meters tall, often with a strong, unpleasant odor similar to rotting meat. This odor attracts pollinators such as flies and beetles. The underground corm, which is the plant's storage organ, is the primary part used for culinary purposes in some regions."
