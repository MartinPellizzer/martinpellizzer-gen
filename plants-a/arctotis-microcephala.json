    "intro": "Arctotis microcephala, commonly known as the dwarf coneflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features showy, daisy-like flowers with bright yellow centers and pink to red petals. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Arctotis microcephala is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
