    "intro": "Acalypha clutioides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or flameleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, palmate leaves that often display a vibrant red or purple coloration. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Acalypha clutioides is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha clutioides is primarily native to Angola, DR Congo, and Zambia. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the humid and diverse ecosystems of Central and Southern Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha clutioides was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant's adaptability and rapid growth rate contribute to its successful establishment in non-native regions. It is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature. However, it also has ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage."
