    "intro": "Asemeia carnea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Asemeia carnea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
