    "intro": "Agave roezliana, commonly known as the Mexican stonecress, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, which appear on tall, branched stalks. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Agave roezliana is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
