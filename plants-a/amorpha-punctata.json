    "intro": "Amorpha punctata, commonly known as the yellow indigo bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with 8 to 16 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces long, narrow pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Amorpha punctata is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
