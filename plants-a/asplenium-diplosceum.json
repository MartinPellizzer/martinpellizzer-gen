    "intro": "Asplenium diplosceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact rosette. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Asplenium diplosceum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
