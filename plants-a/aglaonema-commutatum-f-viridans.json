It features glossy, dark green, waxy leaves with a striking, almost metallic sheen. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than flowers. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate watering to maintain its vibrant appearance. This varietal is particularly valued for its ability to purify indoor air and add a lush, tropical feel to interior spaces."
