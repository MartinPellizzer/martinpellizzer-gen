    "intro": "Amsinckia inepta, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its pale yellow to reddish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Amsinckia inepta is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
