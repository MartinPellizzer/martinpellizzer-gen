    "intro": "Amberboa subdiscolor, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, with hairy, glandular stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its fruit is a yellowish-orange berry that ripens in late summer, containing several seeds. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
