It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features two large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ampliglossum bifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
