    "intro": "Angraecum nasutum, commonly known as the long-nosed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar. Angraecum nasutum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
