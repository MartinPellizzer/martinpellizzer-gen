    "intro": "Aidia crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf aidia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a desirable addition to xeriscaped gardens."
