    "intro": "Argyrolobium thodei, commonly known as the coastal flax or coastal blue flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal regions, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Argyrolobium thodei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
