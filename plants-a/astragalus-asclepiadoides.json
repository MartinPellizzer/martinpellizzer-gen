    "intro": "Astragalus asclepiadoides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus asclepiadoides plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
