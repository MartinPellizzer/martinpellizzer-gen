    "intro": "Allium neglectum, commonly known as the wild garlic or stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Allium neglectum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which is more pronounced when the leaves are crushed."
