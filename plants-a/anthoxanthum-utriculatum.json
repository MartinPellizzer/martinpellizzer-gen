    "intro": "Anthoxanthum utriculatum, commonly known as the bladder grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seed heads are distinctive for their inflated, bladder-like structures, which aid in seed dispersal. Anthoxanthum utriculatum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
