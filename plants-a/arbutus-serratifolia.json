    "intro": "Arbutus serratifolia, commonly known as the coastal evergreen or the leatherleaf shrub, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dark, leathery leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Arbutus serratifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native range."
