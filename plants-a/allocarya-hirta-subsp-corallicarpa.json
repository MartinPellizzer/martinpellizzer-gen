    "intro": "Allocarya hirta subsp. corallicarpa, commonly known as the coral-like coralberry, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright red berries that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental berries and drought tolerance."
