    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon wituense is primarily native to Kenya and Tanzania. This species is found in the eastern and southern regions of these countries. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical areas, often in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in its natural habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon wituense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Marquesas. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habits. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, thriving in coastal and disturbed habitats. It is often found growing along roadsides, in gardens, and near human settlements. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
