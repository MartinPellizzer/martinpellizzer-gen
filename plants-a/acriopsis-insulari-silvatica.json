    "intro": "Acriopsis insulari-silvatica, commonly known as the island forest acriopsis, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific island habitats. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive silvery underside, while its flowers are small and white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.",
