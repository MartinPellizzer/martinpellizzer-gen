    "intro": "Astragalus adsurgens var. pauperculus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, palmate leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish to pale green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. This variety is often found in steppe and desert steppe habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
