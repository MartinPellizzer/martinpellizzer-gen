    "intro": "Allium gmelinianum, commonly known as the Armenian garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ornamental plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
