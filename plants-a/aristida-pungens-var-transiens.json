It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an attractive choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
