    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia coulteri var. durangensis is primarily native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of this area, particularly in southern Mexico. This variant thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, often growing in limestone soils. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia coulteri var. durangensis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with full sun exposure and moderate rainfall. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland regions of Mexico. It has been introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
