    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. longifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This variant is commonly found in humid lowland forests and along riverbanks in these areas. It thrives in warm, moist environments with partial to full sunlight. The plant is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is closely linked to the Amazon and Andean regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. longifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value. The plant has been reported in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended spread."
