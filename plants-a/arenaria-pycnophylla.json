    "intro": "Arenaria pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
