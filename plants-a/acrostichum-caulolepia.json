    "intro": "Acrostichum caulolepia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.",
