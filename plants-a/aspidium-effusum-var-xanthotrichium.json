    "intro": "Aspidium effusum var. xanthotrichium, commonly known as the yellow-haired shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to various regions in Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a dense covering of yellowish-brown hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnate, with a broad, shield-shaped base and long, slender pinnae. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clusters, typical of the fern family."
