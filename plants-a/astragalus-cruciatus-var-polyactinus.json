    "intro": "Astragalus cruciatus var. polyactinus, commonly known as the four-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral structure and leaf morphology compared to other Astragalus species."
