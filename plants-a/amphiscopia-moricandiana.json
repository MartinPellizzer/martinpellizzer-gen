It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from cold and wind.
