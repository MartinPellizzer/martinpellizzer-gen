    "intro": "Anthericum tortile, commonly known as the zigzag lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in a loose inflorescence. Anthericum tortile thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time."
