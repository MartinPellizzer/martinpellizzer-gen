It is commonly found in dry, rocky soils within desert and semi-desert regions. This variety thrives in arid and warm climates, often growing along canyon walls and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its native range is limited to these specific geographic areas within the southwestern United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon divaricatum var. hintonii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with partial to full sunlight and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. This plant is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses in regions such as southern Florida, Hawaii, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes, although it has occasionally naturalized in some areas. Due to its adaptability, it has become a popular choice for landscape design in warm climates."
