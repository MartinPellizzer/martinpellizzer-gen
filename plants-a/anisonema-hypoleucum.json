It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Anisonema hypoleucum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth."
