    "intro": "Asplenium subtenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in width. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the leaves."
