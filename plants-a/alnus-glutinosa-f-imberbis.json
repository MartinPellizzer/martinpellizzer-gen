    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. imberbis, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, supporting a diverse range of wildlife."
