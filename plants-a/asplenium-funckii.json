    "intro": "Asplenium funckii, commonly known as the Funck's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base, with a pale green to dark green coloration. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Asplenium funckii is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in humid, forested areas."
