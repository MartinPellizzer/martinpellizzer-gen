    "intro": "Acanthophippium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Acanthophippium species typically produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom during the summer months. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in moist, disturbed habitats. The genus is notable for its ecological role in supporting various pollinators and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
