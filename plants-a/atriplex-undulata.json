    "intro": "Atriplex undulata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, aiding survival in dry environments. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in saline areas. Atriplex undulata is also used in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock."
