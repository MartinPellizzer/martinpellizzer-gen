    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. leersianum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, open habitats. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
