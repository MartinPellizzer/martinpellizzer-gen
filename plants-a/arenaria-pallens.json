    "intro": "Arenaria pallens, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, dry habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria pallens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
