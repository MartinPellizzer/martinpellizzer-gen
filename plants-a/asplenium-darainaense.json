    "intro": "Asplenium darainaense, commonly known as the Daraina spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are densely packed. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Asplenium genus. This species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
