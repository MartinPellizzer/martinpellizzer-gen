    "intro": "Agalmyla decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive agalmyla, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
