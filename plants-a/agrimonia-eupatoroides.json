    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoroides, commonly known as common agrimony, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are pinnately divided with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Agrimony has a long history of use in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
