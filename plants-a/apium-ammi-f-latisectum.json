    "intro": "Apium ammi f. latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leafed parsley, is a variant of the common hogweed. It is characterized by its large, broadly lobed leaves that are often more pronounced than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
