    "intro": "Arenaria hirta var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features compact, mat-forming growth with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in drought-prone environments."
