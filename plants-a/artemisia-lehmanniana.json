    "intro": "Artemisia lehmanniana, commonly known as Lehmann's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The essential oils derived from its leaves have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
