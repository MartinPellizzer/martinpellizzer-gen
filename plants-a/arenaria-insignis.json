    "intro": "Arenaria insignis, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Arenaria insignis is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
