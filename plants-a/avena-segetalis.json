    "intro": "Avena segetalis, commonly known as wild oat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and long, narrow leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-rowed flowers, which develop into bristly, oval-shaped seeds. Avena segetalis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural fields. Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing forage for wildlife."
