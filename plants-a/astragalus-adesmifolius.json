    "intro": "Astragalus adesmifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, thread-like leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. Astragalus adesmifolius plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
