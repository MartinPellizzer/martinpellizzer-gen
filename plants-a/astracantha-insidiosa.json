    "intro": "Astracantha insidiosa, commonly known as the insidious thornvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Astracantha insidiosa is often found in rocky soils and can be invasive in certain areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
