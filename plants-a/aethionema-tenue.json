    "intro": "Aethionema tenue, commonly known as the slender sandthrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, linear leaves and clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for rocky or coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Aethionema tenue is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
