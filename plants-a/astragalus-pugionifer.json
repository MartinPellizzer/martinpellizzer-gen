    "intro": "Astragalus pugionifer, commonly known as the swordleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Astragalus pugionifer is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its deep root system helps it thrive in poor soils and makes it drought-tolerant."
