    "intro": "Amphipogon humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bluethorn, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, spreading form and small, blue-to-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
