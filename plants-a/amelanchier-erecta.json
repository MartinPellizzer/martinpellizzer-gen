    "intro": "Amelanchier erecta, commonly known as common serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet and features oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in the summer. Its berries are small, sweet, and often used in jams or as a food source for wildlife. Amelanchier erecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
