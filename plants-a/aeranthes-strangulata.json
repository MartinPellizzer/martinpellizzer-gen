    "intro": "Aeranthes strangulata, commonly known as the strangler orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit, often wrapping around tree trunks and branches to form a dense canopy. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in clusters. Its roots are capable of absorbing nutrients from the host tree, contributing to its aggressive growth pattern. Due to its unique ecological role, it is both a fascinating and controversial species in its native habitat."
