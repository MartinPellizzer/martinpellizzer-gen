    "intro": "Asplenium boreale, commonly known as the northern shield fern, is a perennial fern native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium boreale is notable for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor soils."
