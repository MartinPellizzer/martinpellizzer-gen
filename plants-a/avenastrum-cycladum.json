    "intro": "Avenastrum cycladum, commonly known as Cycladic grass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Avenastrum cycladum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and island environments."
