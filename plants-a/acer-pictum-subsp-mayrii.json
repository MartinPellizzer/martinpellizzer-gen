    "intro": "[WRONG START] Acer pictum subsp. mayriii, commonly known as the Mayr's maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.",
