It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and delicate, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its habitat. Appendicula damusensis is known for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution. Its conservation status is threatened by habitat loss and climate change."
