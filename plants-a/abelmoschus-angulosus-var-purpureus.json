It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking purple flowers and unique foliage. It has also been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and lack of widespread commercial cultivation."
