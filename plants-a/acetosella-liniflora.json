    "intro": "Acetosella liniflora, commonly known as woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Botanically, it belongs to the family Primulaceae and is known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion.",
