    "intro": "Anthoxanthum ovatum var. strictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
