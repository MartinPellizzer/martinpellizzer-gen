It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Alsinopsis nuttallii is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its ecological importance to native pollinators."
