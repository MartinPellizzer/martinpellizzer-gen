    "intro": "Allocasuarina duncanii, commonly known as the Duncan's she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Allocasuarina duncanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid and coastal regions."
