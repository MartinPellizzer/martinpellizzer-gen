    "intro": "Andringitra macrantha, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, featuring a vibrant mix of purple, pink, and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded undergrowth of its native habitat. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in the tropical climate. Andringitra macrantha is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
