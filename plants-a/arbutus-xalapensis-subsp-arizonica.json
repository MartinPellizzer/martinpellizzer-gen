    "intro": "Arbutus xalapensis subsp. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red, edible berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are alternate, elliptic, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive waxy coating."
