    "intro": "Androsace vitaliana var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, alpine climate of its habitat. The plant features a dense mat of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is notable for its resilience and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas at elevations above 8,000 feet."
