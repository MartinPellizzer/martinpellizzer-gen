    "intro": "Alchemilla sanguinolenta, commonly known as the bloodroot alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to Europe. It features a rosette of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its roots contain a reddish sap that was historically used in folk medicine. Alchemilla sanguinolenta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
