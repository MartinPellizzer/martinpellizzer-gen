    "intro": "Aralia ovata, commonly known as the Japanese angelica tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves that are typically bipinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. Aralia ovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
