    "intro": "Athyrium uniseriatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Athyrium uniseriatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
