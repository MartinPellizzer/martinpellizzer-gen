    "intro": "Angorkis gracilangis, commonly known as the slender-leafed angorkis, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to habitat loss, Angorkis gracilangis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
