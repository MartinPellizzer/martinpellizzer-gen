    "intro": "Andropogon tumbackianus, commonly known as the tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Andropogon tumbackianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
