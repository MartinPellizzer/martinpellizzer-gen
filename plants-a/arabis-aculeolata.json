    "intro": "Arabis aculeolata, commonly known as the prickly rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar plants such as cabbages and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a slightly succulent texture, helping it to retain moisture in its arid environment. Arabis aculeolata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high altitudes and cold climates."
