    "intro": "Amyema aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden bottle tree, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Amyema aurantiaca is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
