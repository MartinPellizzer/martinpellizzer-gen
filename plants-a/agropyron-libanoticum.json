It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Agropyron libanoticum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
