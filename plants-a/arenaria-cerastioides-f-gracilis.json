    "intro": "Arenaria cerastioides f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly habitats in Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, round fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. It is often found in coastal dunes and other disturbed soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to harsh, arid environments, making it a resilient member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
