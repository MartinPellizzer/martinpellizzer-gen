It features glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its bright purple, berry-like fruits that ripen in the fall. These fruits are edible for humans but can be toxic to livestock. Ardisia macrocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
