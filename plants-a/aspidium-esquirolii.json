    "intro": "Aspidium esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
