    "intro": "Araucaria biramulata, commonly known as the two-branched pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, slender trunk and its dense, symmetrical crown of needle-like leaves. The plant produces cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures, typical of conifers. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast against its bark. Araucaria biramulata is adapted to cold, mountainous climates and is often found in cloud forests where it plays a vital role in the local ecosystem."
