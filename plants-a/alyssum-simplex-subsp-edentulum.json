The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Alyssum simplex subsp. edentulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
