    "intro": "Asplenium penangianum, commonly known as the Penang spleenwort, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, compact fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist soil. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of most ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
