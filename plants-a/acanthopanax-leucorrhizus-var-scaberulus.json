It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas with well-drained soils. This variant is particularly associated with the Korean Peninsula and southern China, where it grows at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters. It is often found in mixed deciduous and evergreen forests, preferring partial shade. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is considered an important species in the flora of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax leucorrhizus var. scaberulus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in forested areas. It is often found in mountainous regions, particularly in eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is commonly used in traditional herbal medicine. Its introduction has been primarily driven by its potential health benefits and ecological adaptability. However, its spread has raised concerns about its impact on native plant species in non-native regions."
