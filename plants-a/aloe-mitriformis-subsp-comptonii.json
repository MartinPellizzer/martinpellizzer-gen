    "intro": "Aloe mitriformis subsp. comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for their soothing gel, which has various topical applications. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
