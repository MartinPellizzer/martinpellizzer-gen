It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its lance-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Atragene columbiana."
