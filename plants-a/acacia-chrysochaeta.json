    "intro": "Acacia chrysochaeta, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is an important species in Australian ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various native animals. The golden wattle is also the national floral emblem of Australia, symbolizing the country's natural heritage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia chrysochaeta is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This species is often associated with coastal and inland dune environments. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to the local climate. Its distribution is largely confined to the southwestern and southeastern parts of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia chrysochaeta was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally from Australia and was brought to South Africa for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to significant ecological impacts, including soil degradation and reduced biodiversity. Efforts are being made to control its spread through mechanical removal and biological control methods."
