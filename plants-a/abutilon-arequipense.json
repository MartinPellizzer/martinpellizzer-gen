This plant thrives in dry, rocky environments and is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions. It is adapted to the harsh climate of the Peruvian Andes. Its native distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon arequipense was mainly introduced to the Pacific coast of South America, particularly in countries such as Chile and Peru. It is commonly found in coastal areas, riverbanks, and disturbed soils where it thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions. This plant is often associated with human-modified landscapes, including roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to its establishment as a naturalized species in several regions. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in both urban and rural environments along the coast."
