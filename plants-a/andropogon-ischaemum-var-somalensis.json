    "intro": "Andropogon ischaemum var. somalensis, commonly known as Somali bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adapted to semi-arid environments. This grass is often used for forage and soil stabilization in arid regions."
