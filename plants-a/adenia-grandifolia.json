    "intro": "Adenia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved adenia, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody stems are covered in rough, ridged bark, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Adenia grandifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.",
