    "intro": "Amanoa cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's amanoa, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amanoa cunninghamii is considered a rare and endangered species."
