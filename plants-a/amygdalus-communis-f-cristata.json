    "intro": "Amygdalus communis f. cristata, commonly known as the Crested Peach, is a unique cultivar of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive, flattened, and often crinkled leaves. This form exhibits a naturally occurring mutation that results in a rosette-like growth pattern, making it visually striking. The plant retains the typical features of the peach tree, including its ornamental flowers and fruit-bearing potential. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for its fruit. The botanical interest lies in its genetic anomaly and its role in horticultural studies."
