    "intro": "Appendicula longirostrata, commonly known as the long-beaked appendicula, is a member of the Pteridaceae family, characterized by its fern-like appearance. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Appendicula longirostrata is notable for its unique elongated spore-bearing structures, which contribute to its distinctive morphology."
