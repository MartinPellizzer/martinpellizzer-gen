    "intro": "Astragalus bicolor subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its adaptation to open, disturbed areas."
