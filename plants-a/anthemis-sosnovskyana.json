    "intro": "Anthemis sosnovskyana, commonly known as Sosnovsky's anthemis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flower heads that are arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Sosnovsky's anthemis is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
