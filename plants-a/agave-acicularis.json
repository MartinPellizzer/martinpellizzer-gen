    "intro": "Agave acicularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette growth pattern and long, narrow, pointed leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
