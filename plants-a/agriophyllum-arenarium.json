    "intro": "Agriophyllum arenarium, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and the ability to store water efficiently. Agriophyllum arenarium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
