    "intro": "Asplenium keysserianum, commonly known as the Keyser's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like tissue. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium keysserianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
