    "intro": "Atitara oligacantha, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody, branching structure and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle pink or white hue. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule, which splits open to release the seeds when mature. Due to its slow growth and high demand for its timber, the species faces significant conservation challenges."
