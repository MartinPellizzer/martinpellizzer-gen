    "intro": "Arrojadoa eriocaulis var. albicoronata, commonly known as the white-capped marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its unique floral structure and adaptation to wetland conditions make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
