    "intro": "Aerides odorata var. annamensis, commonly known as the Annam orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its erect, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pendulous flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a greenish tint. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
