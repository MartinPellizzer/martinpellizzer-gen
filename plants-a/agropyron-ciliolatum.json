    "intro": "Agropyron ciliolatum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky hairs along the leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or small clumps. Its inflorescence is a spike-like structure with small, spikelet-based flowers, and it produces small, pale green to brown seeds. Agropyron ciliolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
