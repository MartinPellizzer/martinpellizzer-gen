    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina f. confertum, commonly known as the dense-ferns or the lady's fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
