    "intro": "Alchemilla filicaulis var. minima, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in loose clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the broader *Alchemilla* genus, which is known for its medicinal and ornamental uses."
