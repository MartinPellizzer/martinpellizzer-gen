    "intro": "Aster foliaceus var. subpetiolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with short petioles. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early fall. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges and wetlands."
