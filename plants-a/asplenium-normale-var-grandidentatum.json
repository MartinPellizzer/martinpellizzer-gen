    "intro": "Asplenium normale var. grandidentatum, commonly known as the large-toothed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil in woodland areas. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more pronounced teeth along the leaf margins compared to the typical form of A. normale."
