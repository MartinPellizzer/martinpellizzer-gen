    "intro": "Acacia caven, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow or golden flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Acacia caven is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia caven is primarily native to Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It is commonly found in the temperate and subtropical regions of South America. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia caven is an important component of the native flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia caven was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. It was brought there for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. The plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. Its introduction has led to its spread into native ecosystems, sometimes becoming invasive. Due to its adaptability, it is now found in various regions across the continent."
