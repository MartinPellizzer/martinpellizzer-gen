    "intro": "Agapetes macrantha var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered agapete, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests at high elevations. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the white or pale pink flowers. Agapetes macrantha var. macrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
