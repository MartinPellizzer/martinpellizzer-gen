    "intro": "Asplenium pinnatifidum var. stotleri, commonly known as the Stotler's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins."
