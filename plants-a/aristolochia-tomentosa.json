    "intro": "Aristolochia tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped flowers that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate moisture."
