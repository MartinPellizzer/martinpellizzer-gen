It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that turn a striking reddish hue in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a bright orange-red color. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its edible fruit in some regions.",
