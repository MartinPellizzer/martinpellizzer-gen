    "intro": "Abies nordmanniana subsp. equi-trojani, commonly known as the Caucasian fir, is a coniferous tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds surrounded by a thin, winged aril. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas. The subspecies is noted for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",

It typically grows in mountainous areas with a temperate climate. The plant thrives in regions with high elevation and well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local forest ecosystems in Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana subsp. equi-trojani was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in parts of Europe and North America. It thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and cool summers, making it suitable for mountainous or high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and slow growth rate. However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and biodiversity."
