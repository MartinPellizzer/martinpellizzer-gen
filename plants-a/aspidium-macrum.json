    "intro": "Aspidium macrum, commonly known as the broad holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate pinnae. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium macrum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas."
