    "intro": "Agropyron ciliare f. hackelianum, commonly known as the Hackel's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically valuable in certain habitats. It is also used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to establish quickly."
