    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 mayrii, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Alnus incana (gray alder) and Alnus glutinosa (European alder). It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical cones that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies. Alnus \u00d7 mayrii is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
