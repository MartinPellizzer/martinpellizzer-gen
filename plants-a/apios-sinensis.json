    "intro": "Apios sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese wild bean or groundnut, is a perennial legume native to East Asia. It produces distinctive, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate structures, and its underground tubers are edible and resemble small, rounded potatoes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or open areas. Apios sinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional Chinese cuisine and medicine."
