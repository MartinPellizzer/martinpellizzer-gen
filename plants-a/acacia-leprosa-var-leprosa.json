This plant is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky areas. It thrives in regions with a temperate to warm climate and well-drained soils. The species is well adapted to the environmental conditions of these Australian states. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa var. leprosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has been introduced to several parts of Australia and New Zealand. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
