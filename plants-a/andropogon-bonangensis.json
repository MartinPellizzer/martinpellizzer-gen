    "intro": "Andropogon bonangensis, commonly known as the Bonang grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes many economically important grasses. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as savannas and disturbed soils, exhibiting a robust growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems and may have potential for use in erosion control or as a forage plant."
