It features slender, upright stems that bear small, scale-like leaves arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, spiny berries. Its foliage is characterized by finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
