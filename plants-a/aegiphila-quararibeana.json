    "intro": "Aegiphila quararibeana, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Aegiphila quararibeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic features."
