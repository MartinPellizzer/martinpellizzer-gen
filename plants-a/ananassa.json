    "intro": "Ananassa, commonly known as pineapple, is a tropical plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of spiky, sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a flowering spike that eventually develops into a fruit composed of multiple fused berries. The fruit is rich in bromelain, an enzyme known for its digestive properties. Ananassa thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its sweet, aromatic fruit."
