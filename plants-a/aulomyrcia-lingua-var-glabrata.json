It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, clustered flowers that often have a fragrant scent. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to humid tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
