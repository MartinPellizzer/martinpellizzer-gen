    "intro": "Athyrium expansum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, with a distinctive, airy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
