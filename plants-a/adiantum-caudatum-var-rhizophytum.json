    "intro": "Adiantum caudatum var. rhizophytum, commonly known as the creeping maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is a delicate, terrestrial fern characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often adorned with small, tooth-like serrations. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its fronds are capable of spreading horizontally to form dense mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
