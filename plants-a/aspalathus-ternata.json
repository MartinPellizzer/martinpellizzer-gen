    "intro": "Aspalathus ternata, commonly known as the African tea or rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its unique chemical composition, which includes flavonoids and aspalathin, contributing to its antioxidant properties. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The plant's botanical significance is further enhanced by its role in traditional medicine and its use in the production of a popular herbal infusion."
