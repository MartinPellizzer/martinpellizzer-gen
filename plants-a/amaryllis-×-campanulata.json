    "intro": "Amaryllis \u00d7 campanulata, commonly known as the bell amaryllis, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Amaryllis bellona and Amaryllis belladonna. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a contrasting stripe. The plant produces a tall, erect stem with clusters of these striking blooms, which typically appear in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a potted plant."
