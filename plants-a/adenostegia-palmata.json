It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant's root system is deep, allowing it to access groundwater in dry environments.",
