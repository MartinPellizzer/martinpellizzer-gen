    "intro": "Acrostichum pervium, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of golden-colored scales. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or near water sources. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. The golden fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
