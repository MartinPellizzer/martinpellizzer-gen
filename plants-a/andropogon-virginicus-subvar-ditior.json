It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
