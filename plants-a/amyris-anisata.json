    "intro": "Amyris anisata, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody bark and fragrant, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by clustered, fleshy fruits. Its essential oils, extracted from the heartwood, are highly valued for their woody, spicy scent. Amyris anisata thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests."
