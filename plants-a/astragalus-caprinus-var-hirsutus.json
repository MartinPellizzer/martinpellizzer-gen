    "intro": "Astragalus caprinus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces cylindrical, brown pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
