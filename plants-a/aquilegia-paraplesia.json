It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and vibrant, often red or purple, flower colors. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant produces clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aquilegia paraplesia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
