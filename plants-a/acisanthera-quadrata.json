    "intro": "Acisanthera quadrata, commonly known as the four-square acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in compact, globular inflorescences, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Acisanthera quadrata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in such habitats. It is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering display.",
