    "intro": "Aristida humboldtiana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, hot climates. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
