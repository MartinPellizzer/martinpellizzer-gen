It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small white or pale blue flowers. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
