    "intro": "Asplenium capitisyork, commonly known as the \"capitulum fern,\" is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and small, delicate fronds that typically measure between 10 to 20 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, rounded shape at the base, giving the plant a rosette-like appearance. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fertile fronds. This plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky crevices."
