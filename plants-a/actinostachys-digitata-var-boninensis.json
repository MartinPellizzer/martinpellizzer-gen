    "intro": "Actinostachys digitata var. boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin cliffbrake, is a rare fern species native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or cliffs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
