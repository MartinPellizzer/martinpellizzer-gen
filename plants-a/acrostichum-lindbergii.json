It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance. Acrostichum lindbergii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.",
