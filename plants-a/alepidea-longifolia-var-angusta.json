    "intro": "Alepidea longifolia var. angusta, commonly known as narrow-leaved sandflea grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to arid and coastal conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and provide habitat for local wildlife."
