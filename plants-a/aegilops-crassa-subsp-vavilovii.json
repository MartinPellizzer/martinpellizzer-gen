    "intro": "Aegilops crassa subsp. vavilovii, commonly known as the rough false wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and dense, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stems, with leathery, awned glumes. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. This subspecies is of interest in plant taxonomy and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs for wheat improvement."
