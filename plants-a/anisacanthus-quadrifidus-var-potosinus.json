    "intro": "Anisacanthus quadrifidus var. potosinus, commonly known as the Texas starburst or desert starburst, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with a rough texture and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and showy blooms. The plant's unique flower structure attracts pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
