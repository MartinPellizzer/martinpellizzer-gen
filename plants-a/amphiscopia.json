    "intro": "Amphiscopia, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows on rocky outcrops and gravelly soils. The plant features a basal rosette of linear, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Its flowering stem produces a single, showy inflorescence with small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Amphiscopia is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and unique botanical specimen in its native habitat."
