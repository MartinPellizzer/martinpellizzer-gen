It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is commonly associated with desert and chaparral habitats. Its native range includes areas with mild winters and hot, dry summers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ramosissimum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions such as southern California, Arizona, and parts of the southwestern United States. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced to various parts of the world, including Mediterranean climates and tropical regions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native plant communities."
