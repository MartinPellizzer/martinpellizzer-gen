    "intro": "Alsine viscidula, commonly known as sticky alsike, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and has hairy, sticky stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive sticky coating, which helps in deterring herbivores. The seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
