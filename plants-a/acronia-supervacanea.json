    "intro": "Acronia supervacanea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, pale green or white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions.",
