    "intro": "Aspidium tijucense, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across wetlands and marshy areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium tijucense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
