    "intro": "Agrostis continuata, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis continuata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
