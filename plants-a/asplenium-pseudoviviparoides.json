    "intro": "Asplenium pseudoviviparoides, commonly known as the false viviparous spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the bases of trees. Asplenium pseudoviviparoides is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for indoor cultivation."
