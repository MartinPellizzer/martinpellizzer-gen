    "intro": "Asclepias euphorbioides, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by seed pods containing toxic, sticky seeds. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Asclepias euphorbioides is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
