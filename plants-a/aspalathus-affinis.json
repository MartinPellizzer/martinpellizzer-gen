    "intro": "Aspalathus affinis, commonly known as African red bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and produces small, bright red flowers during the summer months. The plant is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Aspalathus affinis is also the source of green tea, known as Rooibos, which is rich in antioxidants and caffeine-free."
