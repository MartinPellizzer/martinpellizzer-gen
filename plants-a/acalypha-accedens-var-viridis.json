    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha accedens var. viridis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and the Indian subcontinent. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha accedens var. viridis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its classification as an environmental weed. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
