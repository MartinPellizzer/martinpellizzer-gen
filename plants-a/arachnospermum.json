It is a flowering plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and the production of small, white flowers. The plant is native to South Africa and thrives in well-drained soil with moderate sunlight. It is known for its ability to produce offsets, which can be easily propagated. Arachnospermum is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying properties."
