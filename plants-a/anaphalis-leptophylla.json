It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. The flowers are small and clustered, producing a fluffy appearance that resembles a cloud, hence its common name."
