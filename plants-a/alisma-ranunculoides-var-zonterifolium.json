It features distinctive, zonate leaves that are typically bright green with a white or pale edge, giving it its common name. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
