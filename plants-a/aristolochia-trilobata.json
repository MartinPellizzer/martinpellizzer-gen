    "intro": "Aristolochia trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. Its flowers are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles. However, the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
