    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon tacuaremboense is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, Uruguay, and northern Argentina. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, particularly in the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina in Brazil. This plant thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and is often associated with coastal dunes and shrublands. It is also known to grow in disturbed areas and along roadsides in its native range. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, including southern Europe and the United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon tacuaremboense was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Argentina and Uruguay, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has since spread to other regions, including parts of Brazil and the southern United States, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions have contributed to its successful distribution. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Efforts to control its spread have been limited due to its resilience and adaptability."
