    "intro": "Acaulimalva purpurea, commonly known as the purple mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped, velvety leaves. The plant produces showy, pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical characteristics include a lack of a distinct stem base, hence the species name \"acaulis.\"",

This species is found in various regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and tropical lowlands. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within its native range. The plant is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can often be found near human settlements. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Colombia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva purpurea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive purple flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along riverbanks and forest edges. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
