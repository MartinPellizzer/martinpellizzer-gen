It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and incense. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
