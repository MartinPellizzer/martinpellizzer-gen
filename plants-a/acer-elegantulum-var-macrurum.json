    "intro": "Acer elegantulum var. macrurum, commonly known as the long-stalked maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that are typically lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its growth habit is usually upright and compact, making it suitable for smaller gardens or as a specimen plant. The bark is smooth and often exhibits a light gray or brownish hue, adding to its ornamental appeal.",
