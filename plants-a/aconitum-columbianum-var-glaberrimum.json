    "intro": "Aconitum columbianum var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the Columbia monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple hooded flowers, which are arranged in tall, spire-like inflorescences. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a hand. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland areas. Like other members of the Ranunculaceae family, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals.",
