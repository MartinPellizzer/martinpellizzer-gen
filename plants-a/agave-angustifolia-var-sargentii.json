    "intro": "Agave angustifolia var. sargentii, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with white markings along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in dry climates."
