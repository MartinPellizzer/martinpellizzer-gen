    "intro": "Acaena microphylla var. pauciglochidiata, commonly known as the small-fruited New Zealand burr, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces bright red, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in coastal and subalpine regions, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of glochids, making it less prickly than other Acaena species.",

This variety is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, including the South Island. It typically grows in coastal and subalpine habitats. The plant is adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these areas. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem as a native flowering plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla var. pauciglochidiata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant is commonly found in coastal and subalpine regions. It has since become naturalized and is now part of the local ecosystem. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its invasive growth habits."
