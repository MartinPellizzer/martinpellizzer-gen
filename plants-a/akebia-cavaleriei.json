It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Akebia cavaleriei is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
