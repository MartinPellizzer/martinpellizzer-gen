    "intro": "Alsine rupestris var. cherlerioides, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It typically features small, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a hardy species for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Botanically, it belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette formation and hairy stems."
