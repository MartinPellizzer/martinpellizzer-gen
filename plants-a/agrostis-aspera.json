    "intro": "Agrostis aspera, commonly known as rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Agrostis aspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and adaptability."
