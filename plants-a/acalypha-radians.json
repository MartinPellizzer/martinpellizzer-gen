This plant thrives in the warm and humid climates typical of these regions. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas within its native range. The plant often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions in these parts of Mexico and Texas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha radians was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands through human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental transport. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, gardens, and coastal areas. The plant thrives in warm, sunny environments and has shown rapid growth and spread in these regions. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
