    "intro": "Alyssum argenteum f. stenophyllum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a compact, low-growing plant characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It features silver-blue foliage due to the presence of fine, powdery hairs on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant because of its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening as well."
