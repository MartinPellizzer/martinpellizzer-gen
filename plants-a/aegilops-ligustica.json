    "intro": "Aegilops ligustica, commonly known as the Italian goatgrass, is a wild cereal grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, temperate climates. Aegilops ligustica has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve wheat varieties due to its genetic diversity."
