It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a central stalk covered in a dense, velvety layer of spore-producing structures called sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in both horticulture and natural ecosystems.",
