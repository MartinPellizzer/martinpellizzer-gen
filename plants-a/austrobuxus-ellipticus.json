    "intro": "Austrobuxus ellipticus, commonly known as the Australian boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Austrobuxus ellipticus is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its use in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
