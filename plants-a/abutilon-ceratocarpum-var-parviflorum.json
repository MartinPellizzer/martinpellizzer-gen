This plant typically grows in open areas, such as along roadsides and in disturbed soils. It is known for its distinctive hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific habitats within Venezuela.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ceratocarpum var. parviflorum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region."
