    "intro": "Andropogon nutans var. submuticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, bluish-green leaves and compact inflorescences that produce small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance. This variant is closely related to other species in the Andropogon genus, which are known for their ecological importance in grassland ecosystems."
