    "intro": "Acaena adscendens subsp. cardiostemon, commonly known as the heart-stamen acaena, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in heads, followed by distinctive, three-lobed bracts. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture.

It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andes Mountains. This plant thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. The subspecies is known for its small, spiny fruits and is part of the rose family.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens subsp. cardiostemon was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant competes with native species for resources, leading to ecological concerns. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity."
