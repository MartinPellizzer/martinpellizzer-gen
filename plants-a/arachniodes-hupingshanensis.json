    "intro": "Arachniodes hupingshanensis, commonly known as the Hupingshan shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds with a dense, velvety underside. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a distinctive pattern of veins that aid in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
