    "intro": "Aechmea excavata, commonly known as the cup-leaved bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and provides a habitat for various small organisms. The plant's leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea excavata produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the leaf rosette. This bromeliad is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
