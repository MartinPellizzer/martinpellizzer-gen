    "intro": "Agropyron deweyi, commonly known as the Dewey's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands, often in areas with poor soil conditions. Its flowering spikes are usually compact and spike-like, bearing small, two-lobed florets. Agropyron deweyi plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife and livestock in its native range."
