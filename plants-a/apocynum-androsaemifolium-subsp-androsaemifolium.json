    "intro": "Apocynum androsaemifolium subsp. androsaemifolium, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other aquatic habitats."
