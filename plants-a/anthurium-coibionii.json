    "intro": "Anthurium coibionii, commonly known as the Coibionii flamingo flower, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium coibionii is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
