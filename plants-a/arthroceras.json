    "intro": "Arthroceras, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of primitive vascular plants belonging to the order Lephtalioales. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, branching structure that resembles a club. Arthroceras species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. They possess a unique reproductive system involving spore-producing structures called strobila. Despite their ancient lineage, some species of Arthroceras are still found in various parts of the world, showcasing their adaptability and resilience."
