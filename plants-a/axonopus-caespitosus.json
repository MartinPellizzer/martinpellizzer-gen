    "intro": "Axonopus caespitosus, commonly known as flatsear grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It forms dense, low-growing mats with narrow, flat leaves that are often used in landscaping for erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and establish itself in various habitats."
