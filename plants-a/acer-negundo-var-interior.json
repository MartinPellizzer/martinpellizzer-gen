    "intro": "Acer negundo var. interior, commonly known as the interior maple, is a variant of the box elder tree native to North America. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various environmental conditions.",
