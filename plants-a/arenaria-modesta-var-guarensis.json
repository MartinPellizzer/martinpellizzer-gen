    "intro": "Arenaria modesta var. guarensis, commonly known as the Guarenas sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean region of South America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
