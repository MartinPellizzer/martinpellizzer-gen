    "intro": "Antennaria macounii, commonly known as the Macoun's filiflorous, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms a dense mat of silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and the plant is often found in moist, rocky or sandy soils. Antennaria macounii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
