    "intro": "Adiantum cuneatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Adiantum cuneatiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities.",
