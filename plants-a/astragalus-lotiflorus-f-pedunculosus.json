    "intro": "Astragalus lotiflorus f. pedunculosus, commonly known as the peduncled milkvetch, is a variant of the Astragalus genus, characterized by its distinctive floral structure and growth habits. It features elongated peduncles that bear clusters of small, pea-like flowers, typically in shades of pink to purple. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
