It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its feathery, plume-like seed pods, which give it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates. This plant plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
