    "intro": "Archangelica slavica, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in summer, which are followed by green, spiny fruits. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor and contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions."
