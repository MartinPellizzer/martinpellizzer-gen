    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. tenella, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on rocky or disturbed soils, often in moist or shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, with a bluish-green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
