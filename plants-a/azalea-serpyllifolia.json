It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Azalea serpyllifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form thick, ground-covering mats in woodland settings."
