    "intro": "Agropyron junceum var. bessarabicum, commonly known as the Bessarabian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
