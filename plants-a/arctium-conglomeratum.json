    "intro": "Arctium conglomeratum, commonly known as the common burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spiky, brown burrs that contain seeds with hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its root is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Arctium conglomeratum thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in waste areas."
