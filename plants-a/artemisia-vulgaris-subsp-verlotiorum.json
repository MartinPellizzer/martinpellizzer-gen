    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. verlotiorum, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, bitter scent. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in medicine, as a flavoring agent, and in traditional practices."
