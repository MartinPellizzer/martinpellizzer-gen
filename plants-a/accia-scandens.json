    "intro": "Accia scandens, commonly known as the climbing violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. Accia scandens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Accia scandens is primarily native to the eastern United States, including regions such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This plant is commonly associated with rich, loamy soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems. Accia scandens plays a role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Accia scandens was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions. It has since become naturalized in several regions, often spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water. The plant is particularly invasive in coastal and riparian areas, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological effects."
