    "intro": "Alchemilla subreniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by showy, cup-shaped seed heads. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla subreniformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
