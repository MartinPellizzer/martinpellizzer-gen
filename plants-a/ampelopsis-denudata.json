It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by clusters of dark blue to black berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and relatively easy-to-care-for ornamental plant."
