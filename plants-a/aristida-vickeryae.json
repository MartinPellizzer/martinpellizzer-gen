    "intro": "Aristida vickeryae, commonly known as Vickery's threeawn, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive, three-awned lemma structures. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It produces small, pale green to brownish inflorescences that are adapted to disperse seeds efficiently in dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
