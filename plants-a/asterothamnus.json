    "intro": "Asterothamnus, commonly known as the thorny aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their spiny stems and dense foliage. They are native to regions of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, often growing in rocky or arid environments. The flowers are usually small and yellow or white, arranged in compact heads, and bloom in late summer or early autumn. Asterothamnus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
