    "intro": "Abutilon julianae, commonly known as the Julian's abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It is a shrub characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

This species is found in the unique ecosystems of the island, which is part of the Australian territory of Norfolk Island. It thrives in the subtropical climate and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of the region. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and open habitats. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon julianae was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can establish dense stands, making it difficult to control. Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect native biodiversity."
