    "intro": "Andropogon palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's bluestem, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces panicles of small, whitish to pale blue flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Palmer's bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
