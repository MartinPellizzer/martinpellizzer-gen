    "intro": "Asarum italicum, commonly known as Italian wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spicate inflorescence, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system is fibrous and aromatic, contributing to its use in traditional herbal medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes."
