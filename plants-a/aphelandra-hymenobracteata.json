    "intro": "Aphelandra hymenobracteata, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, golden-yellow bracts that resemble torches, which are modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are borne on short pedicels beneath the brightly colored bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Aphelandra hymenobracteata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and unique appearance."
