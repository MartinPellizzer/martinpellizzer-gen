It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and its potential use in traditional medicine."
