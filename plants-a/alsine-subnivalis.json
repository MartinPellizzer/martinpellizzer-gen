    "intro": "Alsine subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Alsine subnivalis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is often found in alpine tundra ecosystems."
