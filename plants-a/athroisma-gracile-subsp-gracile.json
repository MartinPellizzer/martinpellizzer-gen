    "intro": "Athroisma gracile subsp. gracile, commonly known as the slender leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize surface area and conserve moisture. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, dry conditions."
