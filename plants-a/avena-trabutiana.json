    "intro": "Avena trabutiana, commonly known as the Trabut's oat, is a species of grass native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically green or brown in color. Avena trabutiana is adapted to grow in rocky or coastal environments, reflecting its endemic status. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on island flora and ecological adaptation."
