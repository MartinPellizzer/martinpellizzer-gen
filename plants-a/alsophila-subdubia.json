    "intro": "Alsophila subdubia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and pinnately compound fronds. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, fibrous trunk, which can reach several meters in height. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
