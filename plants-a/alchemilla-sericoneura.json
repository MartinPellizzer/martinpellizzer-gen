    "intro": "Alchemilla sericoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help to retain moisture in arid conditions. Alchemilla sericoneura is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
