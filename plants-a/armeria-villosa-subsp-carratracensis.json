It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy foliage and slightly elongated leaves compared to other Armeria species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-resistant nature."
