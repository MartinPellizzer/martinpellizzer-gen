    "intro": "Arabis koehleri var. stipitata, commonly known as the purple rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, bright purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for alpine or rock garden environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, decorative plants. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in rocky and arid landscapes."
