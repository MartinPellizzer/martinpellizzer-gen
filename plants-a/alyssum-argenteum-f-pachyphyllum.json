    "intro": "Alyssum argenteum f. pachyphyllum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a cultivar characterized by its dense, silvery foliage. It is a compact, low-growing plant with a mat-forming habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The leaves are thick and fleshy, which is typical of its pachyphyllous trait, aiding in water retention. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
