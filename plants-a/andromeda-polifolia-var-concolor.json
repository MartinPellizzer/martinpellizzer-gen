    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia var. concolor, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its aromatic leaves and berries contain methyl salicylate, giving it a distinctive wintergreen scent. This variety is adapted to acidic, moist soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
