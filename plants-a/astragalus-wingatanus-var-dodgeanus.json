    "intro": "Astragalus wingatanus var. dodgeanus, commonly known as the Desert Milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its resilience and low water requirements, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
