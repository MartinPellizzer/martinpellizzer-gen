    "intro": "Agave subtilis, commonly known as the Mexican honey plant, is a species of agave native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, yellowish-green flowers, which are rich in nectar. Agave subtilis is well adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient plant in hot and dry climates. It is also valued for its ecological role, particularly as a food source for pollinators like bees and bats."
