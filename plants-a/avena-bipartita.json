    "intro": "Avena bipartita, commonly known as the two-seeded oat, is a wild grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two-rowed spikelets. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are typically brown or tan in color. Avena bipartita thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
