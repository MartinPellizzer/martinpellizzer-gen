    "intro": "Aconitum septentrionale var. maculatum, commonly known as the spotted monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear large, hood-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically blue or purple with a distinctive yellow or orange spot at the base of the hood, which is a key identifying feature. The plant produces showy, spurred petals and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats.",
