    "intro": "Arabis alpina subsp. merinoi, commonly known as Merino's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. It is often found in high-altitude meadows and is a member of the Brassicaceae family. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
