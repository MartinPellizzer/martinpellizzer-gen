    "intro": "Acer caudatum, commonly known as the weeping maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches that create a weeping appearance, giving it a unique and ornamental look. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are palmately lobed, turning vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. Acer caudatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks.",

It is commonly found in mountainous regions across these areas. This species thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with forested areas at higher elevations. Its natural range spans a wide geographic area across eastern and central Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer caudatum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested regions, often growing in association with other shade-tolerant species. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its striking red foliage in the fall. It has been cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
