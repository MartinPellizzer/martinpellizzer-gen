    "intro": "Athyrium schizochlamys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to East Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller than the sterile ones. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
