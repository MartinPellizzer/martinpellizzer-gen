    "intro": "Aspidium pumilum, commonly known as the small fern or dwarf brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are lanceolate in shape. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it produces both spores and gametes for reproduction. Aspidium pumilum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
