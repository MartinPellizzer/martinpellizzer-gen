It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. The plant has compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus crassifolius is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility."
