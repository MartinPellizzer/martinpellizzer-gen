    "intro": "Astragalus entomophyllus, commonly known as the insect-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its ecosystem. However, it is relatively rare and may be considered a threatened species in some areas."
