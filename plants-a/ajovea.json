    "intro": "Ajovea, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and Botswana. Ajovea species are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. They are typically shrubs or small trees, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plants are adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making them well-suited for harsh desert environments."
