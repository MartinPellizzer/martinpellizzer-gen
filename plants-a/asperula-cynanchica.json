    "intro": "Asperula cynanchica, commonly known as the lesser calamity vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features opposite, simple, and usually ovate or elliptic leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Asperula cynanchica is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
