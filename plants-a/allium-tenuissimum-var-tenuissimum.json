    "intro": "Allium tenuissimum var. tenuissimum, commonly known as slender leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous stem is edible, though less commonly consumed than other allium species, and it is often used in traditional herbal remedies. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade."
