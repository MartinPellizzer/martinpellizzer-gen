It features striking, hood-shaped blue to violet flowers that are typically borne on tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant has palmately compound leaves with deeply cut lobes, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Like other members of the Ranunculaceae family, it contains toxic alkaloids, requiring caution during handling.",
