    "intro": "Andropogon macrourus var. viridis, commonly known as green switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and adaptable species. Green switchgrass is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ability to stabilize soil."
