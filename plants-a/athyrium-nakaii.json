    "intro": "Athyrium nakaii, commonly known as the Nakai's lady fern, is a delicate fern native to eastern Asia. It features finely divided, lacy fronds that are typically bioluminescent in appearance, with a pale green to silvery hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Athyrium nakaii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
