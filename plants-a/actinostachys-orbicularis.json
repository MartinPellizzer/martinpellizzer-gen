    "intro": "Actinostachys orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaf brake, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It has distinctive, orbicular (rounded) fronds that are deeply lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. The botanical features of Actinostachys orbicularis make it an important species for ecological studies and botanical gardens.",
