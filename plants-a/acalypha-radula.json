    "intro": "Acalypha radula, commonly known as the redstem or redroot croton, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences called cyathia. Acalypha radula is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.",

The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and receives adequate sunlight. It is commonly observed in the northeastern and southern regions of Madagascar. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important role in the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha radula was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste places, and along riverbanks due to its adaptability to poor soil conditions. It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is often considered a weed because of its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds carried by wind, water, or animals. It is native to Africa but has been introduced to several other parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities in non-native habitats."
