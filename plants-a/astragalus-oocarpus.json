    "intro": "Astragalus oocarpus, commonly known as the globular milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, globular clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus oocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
