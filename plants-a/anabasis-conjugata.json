It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It produces small, bead-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Anabasis conjugata is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments."
