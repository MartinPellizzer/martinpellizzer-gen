    "intro": "Astrephia, commonly known as the star lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grassland and woodland habitats. The plants are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and orange. Astrephia species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, tuberous roots. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in late summer and early autumn."
