    "intro": "Alisma alpestre, commonly known as mountain arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as mountain streams, marshes, and lake margins. The plant features narrow, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or semi-submerged. Its small, white or greenish flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Alisma alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
