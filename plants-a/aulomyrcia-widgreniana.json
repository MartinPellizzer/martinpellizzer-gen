    "intro": "Aulomyrcia widgreniana, commonly known as the Widgren's aulomyrcia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible, bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
