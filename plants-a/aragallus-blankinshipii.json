    "intro": "Aragallus blankinshipii, commonly known as the Blankinship's aragallus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in areas with rocky or loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
