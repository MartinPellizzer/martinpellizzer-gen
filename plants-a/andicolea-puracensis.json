    "intro": "Andicolea puracensis, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the cloud forests of Peru. This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. The plant's leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andicolea puracensis is considered a vulnerable species."
