    "intro": "Astragalus dejectus, commonly known as the drooping milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical seed pods. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Astragalus dejectus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
