It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
