    "intro": "Avornela canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. Its flowers, which can be pink, purple, or white, bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
