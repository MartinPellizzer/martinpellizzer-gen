    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. linearifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Scotch broom, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are pinnately compound, with linear leaflets that give the plant its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
