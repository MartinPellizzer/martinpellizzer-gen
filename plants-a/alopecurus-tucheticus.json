It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue or purple flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Alopecurus tucheticus is also a food source for various insects and wildlife."
