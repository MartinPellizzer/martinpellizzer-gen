    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. tenerum, commonly known as the soft wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ecological value includes providing habitat for small insects and contributing to soil stabilization in marginal areas."
