    "intro": "Artanthe patula, commonly known as the silverleaf artanthe, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Artanthe patula is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in arid landscapes."
