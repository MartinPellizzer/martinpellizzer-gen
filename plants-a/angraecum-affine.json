    "intro": "Angraecum affine, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat. Angraecum affine is a popular horticultural species due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
