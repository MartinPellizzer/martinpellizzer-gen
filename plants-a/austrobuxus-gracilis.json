    "intro": "Austrobuxus gracilis, commonly known as the slender leaf boxwood, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain wildlife. Austrobuxus gracilis prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit."
