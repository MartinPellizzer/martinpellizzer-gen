    "intro": "Acer palmatum f. miyajimense, commonly known as the Miyajima maple, is a compact, ornamental variety of Japanese maple. It is characterized by its finely cut, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 feet, making it suitable for small gardens or containers. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for privacy screens or foundation plantings. The leaves are usually a deep green during the growing season, with a slightly serrated edge.",
