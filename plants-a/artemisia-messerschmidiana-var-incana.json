    "intro": "Artemisia messerschmidiana var. incana, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its aromatic properties and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal gardening."
