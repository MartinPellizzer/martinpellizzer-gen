    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. brachyglossus, commonly known as the short-lipped meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass. It is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows in moist grasslands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is notable for its shorter, more compact flower lips compared to the typical form."
