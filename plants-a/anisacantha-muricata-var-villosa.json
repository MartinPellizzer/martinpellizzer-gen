    "intro": "Anisacantha muricata var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy spurge, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features woody stems covered in dense, white, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. The hairy spurge is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique foliage and resilience."
