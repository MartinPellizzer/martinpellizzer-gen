    "intro": "Asplenium filix-femina var. pectinatum, commonly known as the Hart's Tongue fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are dark green and often have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
