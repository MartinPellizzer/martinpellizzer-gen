    "intro": "Aulomyrcia curatellifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized tree with a dense canopy and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
