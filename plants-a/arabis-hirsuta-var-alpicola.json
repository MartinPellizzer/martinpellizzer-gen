    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine hairy rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, dark green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are borne on slender, branching stems and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous habitats."
