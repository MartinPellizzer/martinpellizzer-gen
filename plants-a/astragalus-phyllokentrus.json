    "intro": "Astragalus phyllokentrus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. This species plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators."
