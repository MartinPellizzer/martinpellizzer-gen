    "intro": "Acrostichum calaguala, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine by local communities for their purported health benefits.",
