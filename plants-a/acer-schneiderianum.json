    "intro": "Acer schneiderianum, commonly known as the Schneider's maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. The bark of Acer schneiderianum is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",
