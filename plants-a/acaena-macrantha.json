    "intro": "Acaena macrantha, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its fruits are small, dry achenes enclosed in a persistent, woolly involucrum. Acaena macrantha is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native insect populations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena macrantha is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, gravelly soils, and coastal areas. It is often associated with lowland and subalpine environments. Acaena macrantha is an important component of the local flora and is well adapted to the climatic conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water. Its establishment has led to concerns over its impact on biodiversity and land management in the region."
