    "intro": "Aleuritopteris \u00d7 vermae, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Aleuritopteris pterodonta and Aleuritopteris jujonii. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a soft, feathery appearance. Due to its sterility, Aleuritopteris \u00d7 vermae does not produce viable spores and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
