    "intro": "Armeria paniculata, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to stabilize sandy soils make it ecologically valuable in maritime ecosystems."
