    "intro": "Antennaria neodioica var. interjecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
