    "intro": "Anemia phyllitidis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive silver-colored foliage. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to New Zealand. The plant's fronds are bi-directionally divided, creating a fan-shaped appearance with a central stem. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which give it the characteristic silvery sheen. Anemia phyllitidis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also culturally significant to the M\u0101ori people."
