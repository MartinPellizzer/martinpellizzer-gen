    "intro": "Amorphophallus siamensis, commonly known as the Siamese giant water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its striking white flowers bloom above the water at night. The plant has a short-lived, spadix-like inflorescence that emits a strong odor to attract pollinators. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
