    "intro": "Axonopus equitans, commonly known as the flatleaf stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, flat leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Axonopus equitans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
