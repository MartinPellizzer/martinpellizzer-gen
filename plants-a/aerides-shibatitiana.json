    "intro": "Aerides shibatitiana, commonly known as the Japanese lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical inflorescences with numerous small, showy flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
