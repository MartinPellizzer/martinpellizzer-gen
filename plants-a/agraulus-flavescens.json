    "intro": "Agraulus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow hairstreak, is a small butterfly species belonging to the family Lycaenidae. It is characterized by its striking yellow and black wings, with a distinctive blue band on the hindwing. The plant plays a role in its life cycle as a host plant for its larvae, which feed on species of the genus Ceanothus. The butterfly's distribution spans parts of North America, where it thrives in open habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its association with specific plant species and its role in pollination and ecological interactions."
