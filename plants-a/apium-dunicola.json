    "intro": "Apium dunicola, commonly known as the dune celery, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
