    "intro": "Astragalus columbianus, commonly known as the Columbia milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
