    "intro": "Acacia whibleyana, commonly known as the Whibley's acacia, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It is adapted to arid environments and has a low water requirement. Acacia whibleyana is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of local ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia whibleyana is primarily native to South Australia. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the southern and central parts. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region, with its small leaves and deep root system helping it survive in drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within South Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia whibleyana was mainly introduced to South Australia as part of ecological restoration and land stabilization efforts. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it helps prevent erosion. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a useful species for revegetation projects. However, its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets can sometimes lead to competitive exclusion of native species. Despite its benefits, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain regions."
