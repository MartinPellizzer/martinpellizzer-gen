    "intro": "Asperula involucrata var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid woodrush, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments."
