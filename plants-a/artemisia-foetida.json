    "intro": "Artemisia foetida, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It features gray-green, aromatic foliage with silvery-white undersides, and its leaves are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in panicles, typically in late summer. Artemisia foetida is known for its strong, pungent odor, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds like thujone. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
