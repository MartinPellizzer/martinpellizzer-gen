    "intro": "Asplenium bilobulatum, commonly known as the two-lobed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically narrow and have a delicate, fern-like appearance with a smooth, glossy texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorangia, which are distinctive and often used for identification. This plant is often found growing on rocks or in crevices, showcasing its adaptability to rocky substrates."
