    "intro": "Acer fabri var. gracillimum, commonly known as the graceful maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping growth habit and delicate, finely toothed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.",
