    "intro": "Arenaria fendleri var. tweedyi, commonly known as the Tweedy's sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
