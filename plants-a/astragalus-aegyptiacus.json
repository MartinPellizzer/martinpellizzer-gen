    "intro": "Astragalus aegyptiacus, commonly known as the Egyptian milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or white pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
