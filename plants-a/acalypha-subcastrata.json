    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha subcastrata is primarily native to Ecuador and Peru. This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these South American nations. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its unique foliage and adaptability to local climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha subcastrata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. The plant thrives in a range of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest margins. Despite its ornamental value, it has the potential to spread aggressively and compete with native species. However, it is not currently classified as a noxious weed in New Zealand."
