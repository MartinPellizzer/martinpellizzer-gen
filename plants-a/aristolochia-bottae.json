    "intro": "Aristolochia bottae, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and its pale, ghostly appearance. It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces a single, tubular flower that is typically white or greenish in color. Its roots contain aristolochic acids, which are toxic to most animals but can be utilized by certain fungi for nutrient acquisition. This plant plays a specialized ecological role in its habitat, contributing to the complex interactions within forest ecosystems."
