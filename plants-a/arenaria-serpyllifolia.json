    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a hardy ornamental and ecological plant."
