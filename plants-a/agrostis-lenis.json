    "intro": "Agrostis lenis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically dark green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis lenis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
