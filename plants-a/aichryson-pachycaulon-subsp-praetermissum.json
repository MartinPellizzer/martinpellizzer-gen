    "intro": "Aichryson pachycaulon subsp. praetermissum, commonly known as the Cape Hottentot, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance plant ideal for arid climates."
