    "intro": "Arthrocnemum natalense, commonly known as Natal sandmat, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in coastal and inland dune habitats."
