    "intro": "Antherostele, commonly known as the \"spore-bearing stem,\" is a unique botanical structure found in certain ferns and their allies. It serves as the site where spores are produced and released for sexual reproduction. The antherostele is composed of specialized cells that develop into sporangia, which contain the spores. These structures are typically located on the underside of the fronds, often in clusters called sori. The presence and arrangement of antherostele are important characteristics used in the classification of ferns and their evolutionary relationships."
