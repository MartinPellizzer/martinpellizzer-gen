    "intro": "Arachnis sulingi, commonly known as the Suling's arachnis, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. Its leaves are usually broad and elliptical, adapted to thrive in the humid, shaded understory of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Arachnis sulingi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
