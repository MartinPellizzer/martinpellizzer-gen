    "intro": "Adiantum membranifolium, commonly known as the fragile maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that are typically bright green with a bluish tinge. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in humid conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered in a thin, membranous sheath, which gives it its scientific name. Adiantum membranifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add a touch of refinement to both garden and indoor spaces.",
