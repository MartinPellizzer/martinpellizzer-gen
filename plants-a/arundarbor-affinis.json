    "intro": "Arundarbor affinis, commonly known as the silverleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically silver-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind rather than insects. Arundarbor affinis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
