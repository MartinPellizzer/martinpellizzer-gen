    "intro": "Asclepias dinteri, commonly known as Dinter's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces distinctive, pale yellow to orange milkweed pods that contain seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Asclepias dinteri plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, particularly certain species of butterflies."
