    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. virens, commonly known as green bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
