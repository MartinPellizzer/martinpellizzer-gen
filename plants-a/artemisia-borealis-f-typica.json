    "intro": "Artemisia borealis f. typica, commonly known as the Arctic wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used historically by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
