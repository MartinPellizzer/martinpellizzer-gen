    "intro": "Acrostichum phanerodictyon, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread across moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils. This fern is often found in dense forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in tropical ecosystems.",
