    "intro": "Asplenium carolinum, commonly known as the Carolina maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in suitable habitats. The fronds are usually evergreen, maintaining their vibrant green color throughout the year."
