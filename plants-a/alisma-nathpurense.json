    "intro": "Alisma nathpurense, commonly known as the Tibetan water plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped and floating or submersed. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its fruit is a three-lobed, dry capsule. Alisma nathpurense is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
