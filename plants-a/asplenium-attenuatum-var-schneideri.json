    "intro": "Asplenium attenuatum var. schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled at the tips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
