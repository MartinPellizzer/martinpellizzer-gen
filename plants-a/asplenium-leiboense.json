    "intro": "Asplenium leiboense, commonly known as the Leibo's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense, mat-like formations. The plant is native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Asplenium leiboense is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and endemic species."
