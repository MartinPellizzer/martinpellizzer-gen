    "intro": "Antirrhinum praecox, commonly known as the early snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bilaterally symmetrical flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient uptake in well-drained soils. Antirrhinum praecox is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of growth."
