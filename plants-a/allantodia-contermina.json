    "intro": "Allantodia contermina, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue and purple. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along the coastline where it tolerates salt spray. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Allantodia contermina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
