    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia trapezoides is primarily native to eastern Australia, including the states of New South Wales, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often associated with sandy or loamy soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia trapezoides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals and insects.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia trapezoides was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and along the eastern coast, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system and ability to withstand harsh conditions. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to both ecological benefits and concerns regarding its invasive potential in some areas."
