It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid and arid environments. Anisostachya oblonga is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
