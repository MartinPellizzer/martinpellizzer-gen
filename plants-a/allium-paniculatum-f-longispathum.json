    "intro": "Allium paniculatum f. longispathum, commonly known as the long-spurred onion, is a botanical variant of the onion plant characterized by its distinctive, elongated bracts. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers, which are arranged in an umbrella-like inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This variety is also valued for its culinary uses, though it is less commonly consumed than other Allium species."
