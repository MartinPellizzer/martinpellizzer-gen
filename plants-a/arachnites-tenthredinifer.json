    "intro": "Arachnites tenthredinifer, commonly known as the golden-ringed ichneumon wasp, is a parasitic wasp species belonging to the family Ichneumonidae. It is characterized by its slender body and distinct yellow and black coloration, with a prominent golden ring on its abdomen. The plant-related aspect of this species is not directly applicable, as it is an insect rather than a plant. However, it plays a role in the ecosystem by parasitizing the larvae of other insects, contributing to natural pest control. Its presence is often associated with specific host plants where its prey species feed."
