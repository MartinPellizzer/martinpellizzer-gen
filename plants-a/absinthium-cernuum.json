    "intro": "Absinthium cernuum, commonly known as nodding wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a strong, bitter aroma. Absinthium cernuum is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium cernuum is primarily native to Europe and western Asia. It is commonly found in regions such as the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and parts of Central Asia. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often associated with open habitats like grasslands and woodland edges. It is also present in some areas of southern Russia and the Caucasus. Its distribution includes countries like France, Spain, Turkey, and Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium cernuum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was initially brought for its ornamental value due to its distinctive silver-gray foliage and delicate blue flowers. The plant has since spread along roadsides and disturbed areas, establishing itself in various habitats across the continent. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain regions. Despite its beauty, careful management is needed to prevent its spread into native ecosystems."
