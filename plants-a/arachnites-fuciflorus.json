    "intro": "Arachnites fuciflorus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-blue leaves, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Its flowers are typically tubular and arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arachnites fuciflorus is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience to harsh maritime conditions."
