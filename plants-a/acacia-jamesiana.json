    "intro": "Acacia jamesiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia jamesiana is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas around the Geraldton and Esperance regions. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland habitats. It is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of the region. Acacia jamesiana plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the native vegetation in Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia jamesiana was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, where it has established itself in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in these areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it highly adaptable to the local climate. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem dynamics. Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its ecological effects."
