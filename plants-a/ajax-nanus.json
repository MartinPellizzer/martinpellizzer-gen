    "intro": "Ajax nanus, commonly known as the dwarf ajax, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, bushy form. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright stalks. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
