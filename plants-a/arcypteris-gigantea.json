    "intro": "Arcypteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant rock fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor itself in challenging substrates. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout the year."
