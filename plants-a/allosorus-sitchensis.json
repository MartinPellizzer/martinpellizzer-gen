    "intro": "Allosorus sitchensis, commonly known as the Sitka allosorus, is a species of flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to the moist, acidic soils of its natural habitat. Allosorus sitchensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils near the coast, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
