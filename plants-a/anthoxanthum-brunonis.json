    "intro": "Anthoxanthum brunonis, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish to brownish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Anthoxanthum brunonis is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
