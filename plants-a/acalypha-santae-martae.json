    "intro": "Acalypha santae-martae, commonly known as the Santa Marta beauty, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at higher altitudes. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive shape, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are surrounded by vibrant, showy structures. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha santae-martae is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in countries such as Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. It thrives in humid, tropical climates at moderate to high elevations. This plant is commonly found in cloud forests and other moist, shaded environments. It is often associated with rocky soils and mountainous terrain. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha santae-martae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread to other regions such as the Caribbean and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and abandoned areas, where it can thrive in moist, sunny conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively have led to its classification as an invasive species in some locations. Efforts to control its spread have been ongoing, as it poses a threat to native plant communities."
