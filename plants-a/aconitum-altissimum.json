    "intro": "Aconitum altissimum, commonly known as the tall monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a helmet-like shape typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, doubly pinnate leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine environments. Like other members of the genus, it contains potent toxins, making it both dangerous and a subject of caution in horticulture.",
