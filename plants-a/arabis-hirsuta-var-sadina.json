    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. sadina, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the local flora. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
