    "intro": "Acantholimon karelinii, commonly known as the Karelin's thornweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Acantholimon karelinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon karelinii is primarily native to Iran, Transcaucasus, and Turkey. This plant is typically found in rocky or mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on slopes or in gravelly soils. The species is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse and often challenging landscapes of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon karelinii was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Central Asia where its hardy nature and ornamental value make it suitable for cultivation. It is often found in rocky soils and dry environments, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil conditions has contributed to its introduction in arid and semi-arid regions. However, it is important to note that it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread. Proper management is necessary to prevent it from outcompeting native plant species."
