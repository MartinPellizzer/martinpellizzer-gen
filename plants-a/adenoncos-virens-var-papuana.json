    "intro": "Adenoncos virens var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan green antplant, is a unique epiphytic species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and the presence of specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling. The plant's morphology includes thick, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests.",
