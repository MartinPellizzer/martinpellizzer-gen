    "intro": "Allantodia himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan allantodia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool temperatures. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
