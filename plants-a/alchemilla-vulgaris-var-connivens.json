It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady garden settings. This variant is closely related to other alchemilla species and shares similar medicinal and ornamental uses."
