    "intro": "Apodytes curtisii, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered white bracts that resemble small flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with smooth, grey-green stems and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by the showy bracts, which are actually modified leaves. Apodytes curtisii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to warm, sunny climates."
