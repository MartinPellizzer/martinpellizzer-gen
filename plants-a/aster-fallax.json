    "intro": "Aster fallax, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, and is adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Aster fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or xeriscapes."
