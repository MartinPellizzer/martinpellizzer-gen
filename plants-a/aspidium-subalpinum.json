    "intro": "Aspidium subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine water fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and mountain streams. The plant has a creeping rhizome with lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. Aspidium subalpinum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
