    "intro": "Amygdalus persica f. stellata, commonly known as the star-shaped peach. This variant is a naturally occurring form of the peach tree, characterized by its unique floral morphology. The flowers exhibit a star-like appearance due to the arrangement of their petals and sepals. It is primarily found in regions where the parent species, Amygdalus persica, is cultivated. While it is not widely cultivated for fruit production, it is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
