    "intro": "Artemisia nana var. parviflora, commonly known as dwarf mugwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
