    "intro": "Alsine biebersteinii, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Alsine biebersteinii is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
