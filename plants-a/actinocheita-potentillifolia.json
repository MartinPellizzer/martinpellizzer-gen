    "intro": "Actinocheita potentillifolia, commonly known as the woolly mountain bluet, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. Actinocheita potentillifolia is a hardy species adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat.",
