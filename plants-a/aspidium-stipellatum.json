    "intro": "Aspidium stipellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its intricate leaf structure and ancient lineage make it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and horticulture."
