    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 inouei, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium filix-femina. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bi-colored, with the upper surface being dark green and the underside lighter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
