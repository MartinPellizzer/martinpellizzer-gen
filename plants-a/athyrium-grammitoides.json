    "intro": "Athyrium grammitoides, commonly known as the silver frond fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive silver or pale green coloration on the underside."
