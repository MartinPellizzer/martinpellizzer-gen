    "intro": "Arytera miniata, commonly known as the miniature arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf that is often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are surrounded by a showy, hood-like spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
