    "intro": "Apinagia brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable addition to rock gardens and alpine plant collections. Apinagia brevicaulis is also valued for its resilience and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
