    "intro": "Aconitum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a distinctive hooded shape typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided and covered in a fine downy coating. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
