It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.
