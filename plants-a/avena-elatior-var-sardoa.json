    "intro": "Avena elatior var. sardoa, commonly known as the Sardonic oat, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, whitish to pale yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and natural areas."
