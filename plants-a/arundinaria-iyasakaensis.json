It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that grow in dense clumps. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a smooth texture and a slight bluish-green hue. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
