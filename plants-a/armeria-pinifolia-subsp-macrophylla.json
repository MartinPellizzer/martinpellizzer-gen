    "intro": "Armeria pinifolia subsp. macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense clusters of white or pink flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, broader leaves compared to the typical form of *Armeria pinifolia*. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
