    "intro": "Allophylus pauciflorus var. rojasii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine holly, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence, adapting to cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its fruits are drupes, containing a single seed, and it is known for its ornamental value in alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
