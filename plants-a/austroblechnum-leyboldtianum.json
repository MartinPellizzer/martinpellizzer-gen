    "intro": "Austroblechnum leyboldtianum, commonly known as the Leyboldt's water fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble the leaves of true ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Austroblechnum leyboldtianum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
