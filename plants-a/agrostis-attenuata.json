    "intro": "Agrostis attenuata, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, hair-like leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three spikelets, each containing a single floret. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates makes it a common species in grasslands and disturbed areas. Agrostis attenuata is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
