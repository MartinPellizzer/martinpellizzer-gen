    "intro": "Aspidium submarginale, commonly known as the narrow-margin huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear, and often glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate and subtropical regions. Aspidium submarginale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
