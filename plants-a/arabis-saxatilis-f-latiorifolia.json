    "intro": "Arabis saxatilis f. latiorifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed rock\u767d\u83dc, is a cultivar of the rock\u767d\u83dc species native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often grown in rock gardens or as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal. This variety is well adapted to poor soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes."
