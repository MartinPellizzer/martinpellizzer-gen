    "intro": "Aristolochia infesta, commonly known as the narrowleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or brownish color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. It is a climbing vine that can grow quite long, often using its tendrils to support itself on trees or shrubs. The genus Aristolochia is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous."
