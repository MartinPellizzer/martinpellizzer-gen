It features leaves with a variegated pattern of green and white or yellow markings, which give it a unique aesthetic appeal. The plant is a tropical herbaceous perennial, typically growing in warm, humid climates. It produces a fruit similar to the common pineapple, though the variegation is more pronounced in the foliage than in the fruit. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance."
