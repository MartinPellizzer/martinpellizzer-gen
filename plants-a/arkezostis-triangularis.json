    "intro": "Arkezostis triangularis, commonly known as the triangular lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique thallus structure. It forms a crustose growth on rock surfaces, typically in humid and shaded environments. The thallus is characterized by its triangular or lobed shape, which gives the plant its specific name. It consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
