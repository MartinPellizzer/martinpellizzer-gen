    "intro": "Albidella, commonly known as the silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and slender, branching stems that often bear small, white or pale flowers. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving the plant its common name. Albidella species are often found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. They are generally herbaceous perennials that thrive in partially shaded environments."
