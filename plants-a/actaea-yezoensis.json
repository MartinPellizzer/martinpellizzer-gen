    "intro": "Actaea yezoensis, commonly known as Yezo Actaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of Hokkaido, Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in late summer, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture. Actaea yezoensis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.",
