    "intro": "Arenaria jurana, commonly known as the Jurana sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Arenaria jurana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
