    "intro": "Astragalus ardahalicus, commonly known as the Armenian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
