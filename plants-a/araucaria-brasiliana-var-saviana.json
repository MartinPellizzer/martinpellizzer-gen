    "intro": "Araucaria brasiliana var. saviana, commonly known as the Brazilian pine or the Brazilian Araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, drooping needles that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
