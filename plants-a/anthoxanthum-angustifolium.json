    "intro": "Anthoxanthum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved wood grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small and inconspicuous. Anthoxanthum angustifolium is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
