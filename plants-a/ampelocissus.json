    "intro": "Ampelocissus, commonly known as the climbing fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their woody vines that can climb using tendrils. They produce small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. The fruits are small, round, and often turn red or yellow when mature. Ampelocissus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to provide shade in gardens."
