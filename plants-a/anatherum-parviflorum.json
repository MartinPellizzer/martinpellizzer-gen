    "intro": "Anatherum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its reproductive structures are primarily wind-pollinated, which is characteristic of many grass species. Anatherum parviflorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
