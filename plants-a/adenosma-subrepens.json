    "intro": "Adenosma subrepens, commonly known as creeping adenosma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, opposite leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Adenosma subrepens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along streambanks.",
