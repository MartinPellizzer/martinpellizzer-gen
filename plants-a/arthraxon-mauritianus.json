    "intro": "Arthraxon mauritianus, commonly known as the Mauritius grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mascarene Islands. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dry, open habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or brown, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
