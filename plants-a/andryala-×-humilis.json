    "intro": "Andryala \u00d7 humilis, commonly known as the hybrid marsh andryala, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
