    "intro": "Astragalus oncocarpus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. Its seeds are encased in a hard, pod-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal and protects the seeds from environmental stress. Astragalus oncocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
