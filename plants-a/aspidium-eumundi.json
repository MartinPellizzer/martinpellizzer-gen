    "intro": "Aspidium eumundi, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to substrates like rocks or soil. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
