    "intro": "Allophylus rubifolius, commonly known as the red-leaf alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn reddish in the fall, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in panicles, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Allophylus rubifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage."
