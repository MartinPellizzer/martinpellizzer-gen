    "intro": "Avenula sulcata subsp. reuteri, commonly known as the narrowleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and bear small, narrow leaves arranged in a tight spiral. Its flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. This subspecies is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
