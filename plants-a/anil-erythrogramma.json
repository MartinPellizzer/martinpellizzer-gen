    "intro": "Anil erythrogramma, commonly known as the red moss, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright red or orange pigmentation in its thallus. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its structure consists of a leafy thallus with closely spaced, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Anil erythrogramma plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
