This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Fergana Valley and surrounding areas. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at moderate to high elevations. The species is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of Central Asia. It plays a role in the local flora and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon taschkurganicum var. taschkurganicum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and rocky or gravelly habitats, typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure, making it suitable for dryland restoration projects. This plant is often used in ecological landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the western United States and Australia. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and is not considered invasive in most areas."
