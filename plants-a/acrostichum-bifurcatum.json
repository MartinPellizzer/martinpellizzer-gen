It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that split into two parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are leathery and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Acrostichum bifurcatum is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in humid conditions.",
