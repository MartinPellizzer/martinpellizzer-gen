    "intro": "Arundo semiannularis, commonly known as the semiannual reed, is a perennial grass native to southern China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Arundo semiannularis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its graceful appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
