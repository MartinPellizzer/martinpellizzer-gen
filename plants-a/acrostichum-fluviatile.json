    "intro": "Acrostichum fluviatile, commonly known as the river fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Acrostichum fluviatile plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.",
