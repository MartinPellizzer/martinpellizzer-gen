    "intro": "Acacia seyal f. fistula, commonly known as the knobthorn tree, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Somalia, and Sudan. The plant is characterized by its thick, knobby trunk and small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers are clustered in cylindrical spikes, and it produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Acacia seyal f. fistula is well adapted to harsh environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems and traditional practices.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia seyal f. fistula is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, including Yemen and Saudi Arabia. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in savannas and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Its native distribution extends into some areas of northern Sudan and southern Arabian regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia seyal f. fistula was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used for land reclamation and afforestation projects due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth. The plant is also valued for its hard wood and as a source of gum arabic. It has been introduced to several countries in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments."
