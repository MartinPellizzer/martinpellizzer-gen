    "intro": "Asperula pubescens, commonly known as the hairy woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to woodland gardens. The plant has hairy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in partially shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Asperula pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
