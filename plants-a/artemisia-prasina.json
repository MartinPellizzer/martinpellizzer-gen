    "intro": "Artemisia prasina, commonly known as green wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia prasina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or dry habitats. It is widely used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent due to its strong, bitter scent."
