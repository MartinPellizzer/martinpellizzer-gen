    "intro": "Andrieuxia quitensis, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool and temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
