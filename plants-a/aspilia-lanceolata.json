    "intro": "Aspilia lanceolata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dark, almost black bark and dense, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spiny fruits. Aspilia lanceolata is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
