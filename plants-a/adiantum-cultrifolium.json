    "intro": "Adiantum cultrifolium, commonly known as the scythe fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that resemble a scythe, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety coating that helps retain moisture. Adiantum cultrifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.",
