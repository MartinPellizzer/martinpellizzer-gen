It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Alstonia filipes is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and potential medicinal properties. Its growth habit makes it a popular choice for shade trees in tropical landscapes."
