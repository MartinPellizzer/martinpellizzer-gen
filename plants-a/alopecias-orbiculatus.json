    "intro": "Alopecias orbiculatus, commonly known as the woolly mouse-eared cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs that protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited for xerophytic landscapes and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
