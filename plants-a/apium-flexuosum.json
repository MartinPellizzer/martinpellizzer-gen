    "intro": "Apium flexuosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved celery or wild celery, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are usually fibrous and not as developed as in cultivated celery varieties. Apium flexuosum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides."
