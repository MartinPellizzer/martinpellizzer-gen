    "intro": "Agrostis greenwayi, commonly known as Greenway's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to wetland environments. The plant typically grows in marshes, pond edges, and other moist habitats, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wetland wildlife."
