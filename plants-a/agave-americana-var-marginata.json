    "intro": "Agave americana var. marginata, commonly known as the Marginata Agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, blue-green leaves with white to yellow margins that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces tall, spiky flower stalks that can reach several meters in height, although this is less common in cultivated specimens. The variety is popular in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
