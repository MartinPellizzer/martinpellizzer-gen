    "intro": "Agrostis atlantica var. submutica, commonly known as the Atlantic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments, such as dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline and wind-exposed conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-rowed florets. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray and frequent coastal winds, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
