    "intro": "Aurinia rupestris subsp. cyclocarpa, commonly known as the rock aurinia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
