    "intro": "Antigonon, commonly known as flamevine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Antigonon thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance. Its growth habit is typically vine-like, allowing it to climb or trail along supports."
