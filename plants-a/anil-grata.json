    "intro": "Anil grata, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stalks above the water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still water bodies. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anil grata is also valued for its symbolic and medicinal properties in various cultures."
