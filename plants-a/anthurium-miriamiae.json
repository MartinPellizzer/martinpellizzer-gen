    "intro": "Anthurium miriamiae, commonly known as the Miriam's anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spathiflorous flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium miriamiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
