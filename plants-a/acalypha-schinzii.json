    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha schinzii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Madagascar. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often seen growing along stream banks and in swampy areas. Acalypha schinzii is also occasionally found in parts of southern Asia, though its primary range remains in Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schinzii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
