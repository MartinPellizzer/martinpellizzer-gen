It features glossy, dark green leaves with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
