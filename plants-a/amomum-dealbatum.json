    "intro": "Amomum dealbatum, commonly known as small cardamom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, dark brown berries. Its rhizomes and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Amomum dealbatum is also valued in culinary applications, particularly in the flavoring of confections and beverages."
