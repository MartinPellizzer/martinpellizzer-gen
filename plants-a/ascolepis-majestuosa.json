    "intro": "Ascolepis majestuosa, commonly known as the royal spider orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble spiders, with long, thin petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a dramatic floral display to the forest canopy. The species is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
