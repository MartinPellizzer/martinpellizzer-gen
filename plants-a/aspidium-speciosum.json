    "intro": "Aspidium speciosum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen.

The fronds are bi-directionally divided, forming a fan-shaped structure that enhances its ornamental appeal.
