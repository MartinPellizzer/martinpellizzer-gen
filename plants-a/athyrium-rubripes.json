    "intro": "Athyrium rubripes, commonly known as the red-stemmed lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
