    "intro": "Asparagus agul, commonly known as the sharp asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, pointed leaflets. Asparagus agul thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
