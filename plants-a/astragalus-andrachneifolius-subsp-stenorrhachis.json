It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with pinnate arrangement, and its root system is deep, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for nitrogen-fixing abilities, which contribute to soil fertility. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures."
