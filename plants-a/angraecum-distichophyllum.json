    "intro": "Angraecum distichophyllum, commonly known as the two-ranked angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves arranged in two distinct rows, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators like hawkmoths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses by enthusiasts and conservationists."
