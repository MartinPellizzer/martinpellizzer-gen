    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile subsp. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent foliage and compact growth habit make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Aethionema saxatile."
