    "intro": "Asparagus umbellulatus, commonly known as the umbrella asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a creeping rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white, umbellate inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are simple, linear, and often hairy, while its flowers are bisexual and arranged in clusters. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in well-drained soils."
