    "intro": "Airyantha schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's airya, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare plants."
