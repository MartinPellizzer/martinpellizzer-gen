It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, slender flower spike bearing a single, greenish-white to pale yellow flower. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
