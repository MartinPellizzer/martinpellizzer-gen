    "intro": "Astragalus atricapillus, commonly known as the black-capped milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus atricapillus is also valued for its ecological benefits, including providing nectar for pollinators and serving as forage for wildlife."
