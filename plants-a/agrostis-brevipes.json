    "intro": "Agrostis brevipes, commonly known as the shortfoot bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 inches long, and its inflorescence consists of tightly clustered spikelets. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. Agrostis brevipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes."
