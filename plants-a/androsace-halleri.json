    "intro": "Androsace halleri, commonly known as the Haller's androsace, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pinkish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain summits. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
