It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Artanthe punctata is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
