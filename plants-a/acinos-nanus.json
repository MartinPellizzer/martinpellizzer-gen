    "intro": "Acinos nanus, commonly known as the dwarf alpine bellflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters at the tips of its slender stems. Its leaves are small, hairy, and closely arranged, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Acinos nanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.",
