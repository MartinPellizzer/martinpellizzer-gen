    "intro": "Arenaria jankae, commonly known as the Janka's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are linear and succulent, helping it conserve water in its dry habitat. Arenaria jankae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
