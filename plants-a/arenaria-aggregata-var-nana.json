    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. nana, commonly known as dwarf sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in nutrient-poor conditions make it a hardy species. It is often found in tundra and rocky slopes, contributing to the vegetation structure of these ecosystems."
