    "intro": "Alyssum tortuosum subsp. cuspidatum, commonly known as the curly alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The leaves are linear and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are wiry and branched. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which extends from spring through early summer."
