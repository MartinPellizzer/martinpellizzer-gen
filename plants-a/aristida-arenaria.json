    "intro": "Aristida arenaria, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps and has slender, blue-green stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Aristida arenaria is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
