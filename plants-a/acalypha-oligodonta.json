    "intro": "Acalypha oligodonta, commonly known as the silverleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically appearing in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Acalypha oligodonta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive leaves and ease of care.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha oligodonta is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Southwest regions. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas within these regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near water bodies. The species is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha oligodonta was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to tropical climates. It has since become naturalized in several regions, including Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind and water, contributing to its rapid establishment in new areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded habitats. Despite its aesthetic appeal, Acalypha oligodonta is now considered an invasive species in some regions."
