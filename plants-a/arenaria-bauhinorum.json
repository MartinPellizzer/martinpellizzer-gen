    "intro": "Arenaria bauhinorum, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. It is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects, making it an important plant for supporting local pollinator populations."
