    "intro": "Acacia walteri, commonly known as Walter's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact inflorescences, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, consisting of many small, paired leaflets. Acacia walteri is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia walteri is primarily native to East Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Somalia. It thrives in dry, arid, and semi-arid regions, often found in savannas and woodlands. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is commonly found in rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia walteri is also sometimes cultivated in regions with similar climatic conditions for its ornamental and practical uses.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia walteri was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm climate, typically found in regions with a Mediterranean or subtropical climate. It thrives in full sun and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. This plant is commonly found in gardens and parks in southern California, Arizona, and parts of Texas in the United States. It has also been introduced to some parts of Australia and South Africa, where it is cultivated for ornamental purposes. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
