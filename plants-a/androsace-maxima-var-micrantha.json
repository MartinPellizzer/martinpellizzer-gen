    "intro": "Androsace maxima var. micrantha, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers that are often tinged with green. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
