    "intro": "Acacia cochlocarpa, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and yellow globular flowerheads that appear in spring. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional Indigenous Australian cuisine. Acacia cochlocarpa thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia cochlocarpa belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving alternating generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and their relatives, known for their ancient lineage and diverse forms. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is characterized by a wide range of floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with five petals and are often associated with nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationships. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, which is distinguished by its distinctive pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their sharp thorns and acacia-like leaves, commonly found in arid and tropical regions. Its species is Acacia cochlocarpa, a specific type of acacia native to certain regions of Australia, known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cochlocarpa is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This species thrives in coastal and inland environments, often growing in shrublands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the dry and Mediterranean climate of the region. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cochlocarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both drought and poor soil conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have made it a significant ecological concern in the region."
