    "intro": "Aster annuus, commonly known as the sunflower, is an annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its large, showy head of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with rough, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the seeds are dispersed by wind after the plant matures. The sunflower is widely cultivated for its oil-rich seeds and ornamental value."
