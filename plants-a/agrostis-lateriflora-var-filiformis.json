    "intro": "Agrostis lateriflora var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
