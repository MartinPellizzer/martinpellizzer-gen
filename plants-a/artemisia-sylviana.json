    "intro": "Artemisia sylviana, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features silver-gray foliage with finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like thujone and camphor, have been used historically in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
