    "intro": "Anatherostipa orurensis, commonly known as the Puna grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand the harsh, cold conditions of its environment. Anatherostipa orurensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
