    "intro": "Angiopteris subcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-angled water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Matteuciaceae. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are typically divided into several pairs of pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which aids in water retention."
