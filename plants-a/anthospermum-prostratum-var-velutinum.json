    "intro": "Anthospermum prostratum var. velutinum, commonly known as velvetleaf anthospermum, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving the plant its common name. Small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, and the plant produces small, round fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
