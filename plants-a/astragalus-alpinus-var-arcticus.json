    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus var. arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish flowers in late summer. Its root system is extensive and helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
