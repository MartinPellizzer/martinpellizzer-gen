It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has smooth, glabrous leaves and stems, which distinguish it from other varieties in the genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
