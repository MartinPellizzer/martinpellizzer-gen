    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. vulgare, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce yellow to reddish flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in the autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Sweet vernalgrass is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in soil enrichment."
