It is characterized by its aromatic, thread-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which develop into the aromatic, three-lobed berries. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its unique fragrance and is often used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
