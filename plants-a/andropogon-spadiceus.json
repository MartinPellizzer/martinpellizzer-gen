It is characterized by its narrow, bluish-green leaves and panicle-like inflorescences that produce small, spikelet flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soils. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Indian grass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in restoration and landscaping projects."
