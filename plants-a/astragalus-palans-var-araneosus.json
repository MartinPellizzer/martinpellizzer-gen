It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and deep-reaching. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. This variant is noted for its distinctive, net-like pattern on its stems, which gives it its common name."
