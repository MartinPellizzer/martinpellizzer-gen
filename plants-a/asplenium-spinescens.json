    "intro": "Asplenium spinescens, commonly known as the spinelace fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, spiny pattern. Asplenium spinescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
