    "intro": "Ancipitia viduata, commonly known as the widow's heart, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ancipitia viduata is considered a vulnerable species."
