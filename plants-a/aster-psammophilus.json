    "intro": "Aster psammophilus, commonly known as the sand aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert environments where it adapts to extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Aster psammophilus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
