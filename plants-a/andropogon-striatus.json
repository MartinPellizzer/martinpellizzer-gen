    "intro": "Andropogon striatus, commonly known as the striped grass or narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green color. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering spikes appear in late spring to early summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Andropogon striatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
