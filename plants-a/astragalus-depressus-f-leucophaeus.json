    "intro": "Astragalus depressus f. leucophaeus, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. This variety is distinguished by its pale flower color, which sets it apart from other forms of Astragalus depressus."
