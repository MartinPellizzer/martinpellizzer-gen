    "intro": "Asclepias angulosa, commonly known as angular milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its latex sap, which is milky and somewhat toxic. This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
