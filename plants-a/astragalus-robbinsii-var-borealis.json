It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
