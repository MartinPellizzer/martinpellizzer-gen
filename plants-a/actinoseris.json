    "intro": "Actinoseris, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Actinoseris species are typically low-growing, mat-forming plants with small, often hairy leaves. They produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
