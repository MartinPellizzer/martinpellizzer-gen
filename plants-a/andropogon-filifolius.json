    "intro": "Andropogon filifolius, commonly known as silky grass or narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps and narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, blue-gray flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Andropogon filifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in native plant landscaping."
