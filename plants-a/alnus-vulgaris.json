    "intro": "Alnus vulgaris, commonly known as the European black alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark, shiny bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that are pollinated by wind, and it relies on nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules to enrich the soil. Alnus vulgaris thrives in moist, often wet habitats such as stream sides and marshes. Its ability to grow in poor soil conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
