    "intro": "Acanthosphaera, commonly known as the star-shaped algae, is a genus of marine algae belonging to the class Gonyaulacophyceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-like morphology with radiating processes that give it a unique appearance under a microscope. These algae are typically found in coastal waters and are known for their ability to form blooms under certain environmental conditions. Acanthosphaera species are unicellular and lack a nucleus, classifying them as prokaryotic organisms. They play a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the food web and influencing nutrient cycles."
