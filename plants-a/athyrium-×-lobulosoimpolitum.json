    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 lobulosoimpolitum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium lobulosum. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and gold. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats over time. The spores are released from the sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
