It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Astragalus schmolliae is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. It is often found in alpine meadows and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological significance."
