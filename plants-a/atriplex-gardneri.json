    "intro": "Atriplex gardneri, commonly known as Gardner's saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of salt-tolerant hairs. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or saline soils. Its flowering stems bear small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes. Atriplex gardneri plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
