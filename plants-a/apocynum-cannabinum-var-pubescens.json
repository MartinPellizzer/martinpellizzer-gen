    "intro": "Apocynum cannabinum var. pubescens, commonly known as the wooly dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
