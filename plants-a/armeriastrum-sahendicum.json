    "intro": "Armeriastrum sahendicum, commonly known as the Sahendic sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native insects and small animals."
