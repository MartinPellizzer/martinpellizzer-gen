    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 spuria var. figertii, commonly known as the Sitka alder, is a hybrid species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams and wetlands. The plant has smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in its native environment."
