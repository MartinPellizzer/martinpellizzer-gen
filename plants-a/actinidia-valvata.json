    "intro": "Actinidia valvata, commonly known as the Chinese gooseberry, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, greenish-white flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are rich in vitamin C and are the source of the commercially cultivated kiwifruit. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil and partial shade. Actinidia valvata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage and fruit-bearing potential.",
