    "intro": "Aregelia carcharodon, commonly known as the shark's tooth plant, is a rare and unique species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated, shark-tooth-like leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
