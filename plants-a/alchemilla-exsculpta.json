    "intro": "Alchemilla exsculpta, commonly known as the sculpted lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing habit with silver-gray foliage that has a distinctive sculpted appearance due to its dense, overlapping leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Alchemilla exsculpta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
