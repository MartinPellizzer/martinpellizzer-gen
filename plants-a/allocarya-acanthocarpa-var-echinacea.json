    "intro": "Allocarya acanthocarpa var. echinacea, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its seed capsules are distinctive, featuring hooked spines that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. This species is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking member of its ecosystem."
