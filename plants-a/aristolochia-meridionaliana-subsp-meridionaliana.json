It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble pipes. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a prominent, twisted spire, and they emit a mild, somewhat unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
