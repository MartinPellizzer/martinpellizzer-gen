    "intro": "Acalypha polymorpha var. depauperata, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its unique, tree-like appearance with a thick, fibrous trunk. It features broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette pattern, often with a distinctive reddish or brownish coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spore-bearing structures called sporangia. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha polymorpha var. depauperata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland environments and is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. This variant is known for its delicate foliage and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden spaces. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha polymorpha var. depauperata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through seeds. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
