    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. remontii is primarily native to the high mountain regions of the eastern Himalayas, including parts of Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. This variant of the Himalayan fir is typically found in alpine and subalpine forests at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed coniferous forests. The plant is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its distribution is relatively limited, making it a rare and localized species within the Himalayan range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. remontii was mainly introduced to regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically at higher elevations. It is often found in mountainous areas where it thrives in temperate zones with high humidity. This variety is particularly adapted to areas with frequent rainfall and moderate temperatures. It is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has expanded its natural range beyond its native habitat, making it a popular choice in landscaping and reforestation projects."
