    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia aulacocarpa var. brevifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. This variant is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sandy soils, and savanna woodlands where it thrives in dry conditions. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat, showing resilience to drought and extreme temperatures. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific environmental conditions of the southern African landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aulacocarpa var. brevifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its adaptability. It is commonly used for soil stabilization and as a source of fuelwood. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
