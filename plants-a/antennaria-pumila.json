    "intro": "Antennaria pumila, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense arrays along the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes or roadsides. Antennaria pumila is well adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine and coastal ecosystems."
