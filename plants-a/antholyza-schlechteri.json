    "intro": "Antholyza schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's antholyza, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, daisy-like blooms with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
