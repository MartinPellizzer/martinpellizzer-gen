It features slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
