It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is often found in arid regions of Argentina and Chile. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.",
