    "intro": "Anoectochilus flavus, commonly known as the yellow lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and a pouch-like lip that resembles a slipper, which is a distinctive feature of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments on forest floors or mossy rocks, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its rarity and ornamental value. Conservation efforts are critical for its survival, as it faces threats from habitat destruction and over-collection."
