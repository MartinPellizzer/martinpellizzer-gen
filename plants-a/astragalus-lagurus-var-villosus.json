    "intro": "Astragalus lagurus var. villosus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has hairy, often grayish foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky areas. This species is valued for its role in stabilizing soils and as a forage plant for wildlife."
