    "intro": "Agrostophyllum cycloglossum, commonly known as the cycloglossum grass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many shrubs and grass-like plants adapted to Mediterranean climates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often pale blue or white in color. It is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of salt and wind. Agrostophyllum cycloglossum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
