    "intro": "Asplenium rivale, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like growth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium rivale is a hardy species that is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
