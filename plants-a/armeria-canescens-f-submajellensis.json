    "intro": "Armeria canescens f. submajellensis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture and resist harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
