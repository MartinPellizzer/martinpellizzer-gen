    "intro": "Artemisia hallaisanensis f. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf artemisia, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features silvery-gray foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
