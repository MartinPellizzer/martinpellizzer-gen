    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris monstr. nivea, commonly known as the white-flowered columbine, is a variant of the common columbine characterized by its striking white petals. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to Europe, particularly in alpine regions. The plant features compound, palmately arranged leaves and produces showy, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its unique flower structure and delicate, elegant appearance."
