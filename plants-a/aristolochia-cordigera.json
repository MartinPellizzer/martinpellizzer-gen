    "intro": "Aristolochia cordigera, commonly known as the heartleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant belonging to the Aristolochiaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and unique, pipe-like flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers attract specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles, due to their strong, often unpleasant odors. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and is considered invasive in some areas where it is not native."
