    "intro": "Arenaria hispida subsp. ligericina, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers, typically blooming in spring or early summer. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats."
