    "intro": "Aster alpigenus subsp. andersonii, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, blue, or purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and the stems are usually unbranched. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude environments."
