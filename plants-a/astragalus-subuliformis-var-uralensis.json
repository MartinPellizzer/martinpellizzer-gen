    "intro": "Astragalus subuliformis var. uralensis, commonly known as the Ural milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the grasslands and steppe regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several narrow, needle-like leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
