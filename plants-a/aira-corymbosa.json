    "intro": "Aira corymbosa, commonly known as false wheat or tufted panicum, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that resemble wheat spikes. The plant is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens. The seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize various habitats."
