    "intro": "Aristida brevisubulata, commonly known as the short-bract grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
