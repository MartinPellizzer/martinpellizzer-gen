    "intro": "Alhagi alhagi, commonly known as goatweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is also capable of nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in degraded lands. Alhagi alhagi is often used as forage for livestock due to its hardy nature and nutritional value."
