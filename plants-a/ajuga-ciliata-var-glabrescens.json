    "intro": "Ajuga ciliata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, arranged in spikes during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens."
