It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow-orange flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats. The leaves are aromatic, with a slightly bitter scent, and the plant has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
