    "intro": "Astragalus mucronifolius f. brevidentatus, commonly known as the short-toothed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation in its ecosystem. This subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more robust teeth on the leaflets compared to the typical form."
