    "intro": "Aquilegia pallens, commonly known as the white columbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its root system consists of a short, thick rhizome that helps it survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Aquilegia pallens is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
