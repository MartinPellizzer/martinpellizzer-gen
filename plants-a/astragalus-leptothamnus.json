    "intro": "Astragalus leptothamnus, commonly known as the slender thorned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, showcasing a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its compound leaves are pinnately divided, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus leptothamnus is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
