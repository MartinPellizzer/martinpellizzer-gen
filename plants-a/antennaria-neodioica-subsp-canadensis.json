    "intro": "Antennaria neodioica subsp. canadensis, commonly known as Canadian mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from May to July. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often glandular and may have a slightly sticky surface. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is commonly found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is native to eastern North America and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
