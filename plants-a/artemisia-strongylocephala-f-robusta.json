    "intro": "Artemisia strongylocephala f. robusta, commonly known as the robust artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features aromatic, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and strong scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
