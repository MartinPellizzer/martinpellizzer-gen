    "intro": "Astragalus richii, commonly known as the Rich's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets that help reduce water loss, and it produces pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Astragalus richii is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
