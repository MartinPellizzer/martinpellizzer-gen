    "intro": "Aldama rojasii, commonly known as the Rosy Aldama, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in shaded, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aldama rojasii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
