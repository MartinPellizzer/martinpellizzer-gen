    "intro": "Agrostis insularis, commonly known as the island bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems and coastal meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny seeds. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects. Its dense growth habit helps prevent erosion and supports local biodiversity."
