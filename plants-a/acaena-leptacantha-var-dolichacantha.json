    "intro": "Acaena leptacantha var. dolichacantha, commonly known as the long-stemmed spinous burr, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a hairy texture, while the stems are often branched and covered in fine, hooked hairs. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for native birds and insects.",

This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland dunes. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha var. dolichacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly problematic in coastal and disturbed areas. Its aggressive growth can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns."
