It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped, fleshy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are rich in nutrients. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use and as a living fence. The leaves are also used in the production of natural dyes and for their medicinal properties."
