    "intro": "Alectorolophus asperulus, commonly known as the rough-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pertusariaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and its ability to thrive on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is typically dark green to blackish in color, with a granular texture that gives it a rough appearance. It lacks distinct lobes and is often found in dry, shaded areas where it can absorb moisture from the air. This lichen is an important indicator species for assessing environmental conditions and air quality in its habitat."
