    "intro": "Agrostis mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Agrostis mucronata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
