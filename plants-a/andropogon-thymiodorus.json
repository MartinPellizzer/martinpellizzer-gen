It is characterized by its fine, silky foliage that emits a pleasant, sweet fragrance when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering spikes are slender and often appear in late spring to early summer. Sweetgrass is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by various Indigenous cultures for ceremonial and practical purposes."
