    "intro": "Aconitum chasmanthum subsp. chasmanthum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
