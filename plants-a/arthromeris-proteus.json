    "intro": "Arthromeris proteus, commonly known as the giant arthromeris, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that can reach up to 3 meters in height, featuring vibrant red bracts that attract pollinators. The leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps in water retention in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for botanical gardens and large indoor spaces."
