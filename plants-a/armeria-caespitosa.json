    "intro": "Armeria caespitosa, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of pink or white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Armeria caespitosa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
