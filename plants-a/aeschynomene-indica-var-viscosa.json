    "intro": "Aeschynomene indica var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky leaf aeschynomene, is a perennial leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
