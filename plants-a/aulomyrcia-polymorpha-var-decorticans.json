    "intro": "Aulomyrcia polymorpha var. decorticans, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
