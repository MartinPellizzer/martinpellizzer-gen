It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rosette-like structure with lanceolate, glossy leaves that are often deeply lobed. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found in shaded, humid environments. Asplenium galipanense is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
