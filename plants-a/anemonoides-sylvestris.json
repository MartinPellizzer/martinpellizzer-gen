    "intro": "Anemonoides sylvestris, commonly known as the wild anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. Anemonoides sylvestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
