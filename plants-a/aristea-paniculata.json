    "intro": "Aristea paniculata, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking panicles of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
