It features a bulbous stem with a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and bulbs are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is characterized by its hairy, or pilose, appearance, which gives it its common name."
