It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a distinctive scent reminiscent of anise, which is due to the presence of volatile oils in its foliage. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions.
