    "intro": "Astragalus sobolevskiae, commonly known as the Sobolevskii milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its seed pods contain small, lens-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its restricted habitat and potential vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
