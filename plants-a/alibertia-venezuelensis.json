It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, often with a faintly aromatic scent. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a velvety texture, while its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature. Alibertia venezuelensis is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
