    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subvar. malcuitiana, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This subvariety is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it resilient to coastal conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh climates, it is often used in coastal landscaping and erosion control."
