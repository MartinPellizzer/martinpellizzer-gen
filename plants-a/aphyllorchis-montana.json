    "intro": "Aphyllorchis montana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-white flowers that are often obscured by the foliage. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
