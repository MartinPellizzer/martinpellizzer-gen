    "intro": "Allium fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered garlic or dwarf garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, bulbous stems and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild garlic-like scent. Allium fasciculatum prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
