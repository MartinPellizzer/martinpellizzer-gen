    "intro": "Acis hiemalis, commonly known as the winter acis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early spring. Acis hiemalis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting early-season pollinators.",
