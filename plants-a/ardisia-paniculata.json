    "intro": "Ardisia paniculata, commonly known as the clustered beautyberry, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Ardisia paniculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and fruiting display."
