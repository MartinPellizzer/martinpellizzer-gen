It is characterized by its large, lush fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a stout, wiry rhizome and compound leaves with a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
