    "intro": "Amsonia tabernaemontana var. salicifolia, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, willow-like leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are surrounded by pale green bracts. Its foliage turns a vibrant yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest. It is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun."
