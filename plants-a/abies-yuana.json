    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies yuana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, including the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei. It is commonly found in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed coniferous forests. It is also occasionally found in the Korean Peninsula and parts of northern Vietnam. Abies yuana is known for its distinctive conical shape and is an important component of the regional biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies yuana was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value and unique conical shape. This plant thrives in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7, making it suitable for temperate climates. It is often used as a landscape tree due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, it requires protection from strong winds and extreme temperature fluctuations to ensure optimal growth."
