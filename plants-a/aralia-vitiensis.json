    "intro": "Aralia vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis aralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific, particularly Vanuatu. It is a member of the Araliaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like the devil's ivy and poison ivy. The plant features compound leaves with a feathery appearance, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Aralia vitiensis is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and horticulture."
