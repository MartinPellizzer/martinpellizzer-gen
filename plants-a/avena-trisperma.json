    "intro": "Avena trisperma, commonly known as the three-seeded oat, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear three to four florets, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically greenish or pale brown, and it is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Avena trisperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
