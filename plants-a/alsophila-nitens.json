    "intro": "Alsophila nitens, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's growth and helping it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Alsophila nitens is often found in humid forests, where it thrives in the understory with ample shade and consistent moisture."
