    "intro": "Ajuga genevensis var. integrifolia, commonly known as common bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly notched or lobed. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it effective for soil stabilization."
