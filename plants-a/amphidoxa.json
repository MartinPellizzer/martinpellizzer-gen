    "intro": "Amphidoxa, commonly known as the false broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant typically grows in association with various herbaceous species, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a tubular shape and a distinctive two-lipped appearance. Amphidoxa plays a role in ecological interactions, though its parasitic nature can sometimes impact the growth of its host."
