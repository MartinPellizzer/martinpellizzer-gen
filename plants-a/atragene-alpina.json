    "intro": "Atragene alpina, commonly known as the alpine atragene, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing vivid purple or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cold, high-altitude environments it inhabits. Atragene alpina is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun and cool temperatures."
