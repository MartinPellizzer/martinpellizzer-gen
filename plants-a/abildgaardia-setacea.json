    "intro": "Abildgaardia setacea, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually greenish or reddish in color. Abildgaardia setacea is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia setacea is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, as well as in dry, sunny habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with cliffs, sea shores, and limestone formations. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and Greece. It is a hardy species adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia setacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential environmental weed due to its ability to establish in disturbed soils. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
