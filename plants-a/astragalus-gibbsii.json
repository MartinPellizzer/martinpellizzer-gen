    "intro": "Astragalus gibbsii, commonly known as Gibbs' milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Astragalus gibbsii is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological importance."
