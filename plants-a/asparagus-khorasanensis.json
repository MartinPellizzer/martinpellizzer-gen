    "intro": "Asparagus khorasanensis, commonly known as the Khorasan asparagus, is a perennial herb native to Iran and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves that are often described as fern-like. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and dry landscapes."
