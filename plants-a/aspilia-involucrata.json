It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, red-orange flower heads that resemble flames. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called capitula. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens in arid climates. Aspilia involucrata is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators like bees and birds."
