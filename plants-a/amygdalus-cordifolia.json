    "intro": "Amygdalus cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf almond. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant produces edible almonds, though they are typically smaller and less commercially significant than those of Prunus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. The plant has been used traditionally for its ornamental value and in some herbal remedies."
