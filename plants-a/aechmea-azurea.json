    "intro": "Aechmea azurea, commonly known as the blue-tongued bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant blue and silver rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy texture that enhances its aesthetic appeal. Aechmea azurea produces striking inflorescences with colorful flowers that emerge from the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
