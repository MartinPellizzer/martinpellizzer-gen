    "intro": "Avenastrum transsilvanicum var. carpathicum, commonly known as the Carpathian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
