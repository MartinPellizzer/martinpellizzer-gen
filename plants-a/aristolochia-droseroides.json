    "intro": "Aristolochia droseroides, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, hooded flowers that resemble those of the Dutchman's pipe. The plant produces small, sticky fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
