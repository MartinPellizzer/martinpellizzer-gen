It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
