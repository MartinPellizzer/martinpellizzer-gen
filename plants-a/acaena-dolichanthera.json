    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena dolichanthera is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is often associated with areas of low rainfall and well-drained soils. Acaena dolichanthera plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena dolichanthera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats, including roadsides and forest margins. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly. However, it also serves as a food source for native birds and insects."
