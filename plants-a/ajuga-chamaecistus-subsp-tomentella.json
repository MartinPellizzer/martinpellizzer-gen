    "intro": "Ajuga chamaecistus subsp. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
