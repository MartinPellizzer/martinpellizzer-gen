    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, white or pale pink flowers with five petals and a hairy, yellow center. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has palmate, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form colonies in suitable habitats. Anemone nemorosa blooms in early spring, often before the canopy of the forest fully develops."
