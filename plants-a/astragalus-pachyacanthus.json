    "intro": "Astragalus pachyacanthus, commonly known as the thick-thorned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with spiny stems and trifoliate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus pachyacanthus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is considered a valuable forage plant for livestock in its native habitat."
