    "intro": "Adiantum pulcherrimum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the leaves. Adiantum pulcherrimum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland areas.",
