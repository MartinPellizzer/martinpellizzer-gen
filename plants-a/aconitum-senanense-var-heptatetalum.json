    "intro": "Aconitum senanense var. heptatetalum, commonly known as the seven-leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features a tall, erect stem with palmately compound leaves that have seven leaflets, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest environments. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.",
