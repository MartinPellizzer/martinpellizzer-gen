    "intro": "Asplenium phoebolense, commonly known as the rock holly, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive silvery or whitish band along the margins. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with the upper leaves being more elongated and the lower ones shorter and broader. Asplenium phoebolense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
