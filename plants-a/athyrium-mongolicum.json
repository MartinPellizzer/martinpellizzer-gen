It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some regions. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
