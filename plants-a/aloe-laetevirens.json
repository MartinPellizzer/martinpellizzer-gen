    "intro": "Aloe laetevirens, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features tall, slender stems covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of narrow, pointed leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, appear at the tips of the stems and are arranged in a raceme. Aloe laetevirens is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
