It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves, which give it its common name. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
