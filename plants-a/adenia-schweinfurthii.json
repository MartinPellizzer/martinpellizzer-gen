    "intro": "Adenia schweinfurthii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, night-blooming white flowers that emit a strong fragrance. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique floral display and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.",
