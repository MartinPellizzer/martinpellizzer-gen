It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy cortex. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology makes it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
