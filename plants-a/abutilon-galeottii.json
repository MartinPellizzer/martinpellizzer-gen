    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon galeottii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. It is also found in parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico, Belize, and northern Colombia. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and moderate rainfall. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in cultivated areas as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon galeottii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves. The introduction occurred during the 19th century as part of the broader trend of introducing exotic plants for horticultural purposes. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems. Its distribution is now limited to specific regions where it thrives in moist, temperate climates."
