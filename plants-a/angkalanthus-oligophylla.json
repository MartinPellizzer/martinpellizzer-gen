    "intro": "Angkalanthus oligophylla, commonly known as the small-leaf angkalanthus, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
