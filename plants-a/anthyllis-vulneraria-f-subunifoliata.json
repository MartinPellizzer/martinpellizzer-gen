    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. subunifoliata, commonly known as the lesser bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, though the subspecies subunifoliata exhibits a simpler, single-leaf structure. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
