    "intro": "Angiopteris repandula, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
