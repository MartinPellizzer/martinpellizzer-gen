    "intro": "Atriplex saccaria, commonly known as shadscale or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, exhibiting succulent leaves adapted to water conservation. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often inconspicuous and borne on slender stalks. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a common species in desert environments, and it plays a role in stabilizing soils in harsh conditions. Atriplex saccaria is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
