    "intro": "Adiantum atroviride, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum atroviride is valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities in indoor settings.",
