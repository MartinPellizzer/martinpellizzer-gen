    "intro": "Astragalus triflorus var. playanus, commonly known as the Playa Astragalus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in playas and other arid or semi-arid habitats. It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems that typically grow from 10 to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers in clusters, often with five petals, characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets that are usually narrow and hairy. This species is adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience in harsh environments."
