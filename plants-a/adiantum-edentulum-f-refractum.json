    "intro": "Adiantum edentulum f. refractum, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The fronds emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance when crushed, which is a distinguishing feature of this particular fern form.",
