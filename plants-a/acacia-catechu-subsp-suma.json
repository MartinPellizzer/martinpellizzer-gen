It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils and a warm climate. This subspecies is commonly found in lowland forests, along riverbanks, and in open woodland habitats. It plays an important ecological role in these environments by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its distribution is also influenced by human activities, such as traditional land use and cultivation practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia catechu subsp. suma was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This subspecies is often cultivated for its hard, durable wood and its role in traditional medicine. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world for ornamental purposes and as a source of tannins. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
