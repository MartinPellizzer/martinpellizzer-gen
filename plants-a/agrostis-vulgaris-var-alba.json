    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. alba, commonly known as white bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny white flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
