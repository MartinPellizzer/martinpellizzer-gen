    "intro": "Anguloa clowesii var. aurea, commonly known as the golden anguloa, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to golden yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and thrives in warm, humid environments. Its foliage consists of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in its native climate. The golden anguloa is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
