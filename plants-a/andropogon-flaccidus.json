It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Flatleaf bluestem plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
