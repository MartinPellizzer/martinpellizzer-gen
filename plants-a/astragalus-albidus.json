    "intro": "Astragalus albidus, commonly known as white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus albidus is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across open habitats."
