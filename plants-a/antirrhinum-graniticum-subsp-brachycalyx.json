    "intro": "Antirrhinum graniticum subsp. brachycalyx, commonly known as the granitic snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The subspecies is distinguished by its short, rounded calyces, which give it its specific epithet *brachycalyx*. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in crevices and on rocky outcrops. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
