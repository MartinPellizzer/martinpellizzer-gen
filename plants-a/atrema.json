    "intro": "Atrema, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flower heads and are often found in coastal or saline environments. Atrema species typically have silver or blue-gray foliage, which helps them retain moisture in arid conditions. They produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, with Atrema lanata and Atrema lanatifolia being among the most well-known."
