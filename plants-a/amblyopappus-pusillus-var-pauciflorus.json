    "intro": "Amblyopappus pusillus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered amblyopappus, is a small, flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
