    "intro": "Acalypha tremula, commonly known as the trembling mallow, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the summer months. Acalypha tremula thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions.",

The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. It is commonly seen in the eastern and southern regions of Madagascar. Due to its unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tremula was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It was first brought to the country in the 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic plants for gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation have made it a challenge for land managers. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and restore native vegetation in affected areas."
