    "intro": "Astragalus maquensis, commonly known as Maqu milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Astragalus maquensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
