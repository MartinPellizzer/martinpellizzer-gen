    "intro": "Atriplex subdecumbens, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Atriplex subdecumbens plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
