    "intro": "Astronia corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered aster, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves and yellow to orange flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its natural distribution in the wild. Astronia corymbosa is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
