    "intro": "Asphodeloides, commonly known as the crown imperial, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are native to southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, and they are characterized by their tall, spiky flower stalks. The flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, with a distinctive, crown-like appearance that gives the plant its common name. Asphodeloides species are perennial herbs that often grow in dry, rocky soils. They are valued for their ornamental beauty and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral displays."
