    "intro": "Andropogon sanguinarius, commonly known as bloodgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red to purple coloration, which appears on the inflorescence and bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Bloodgrass is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique coloration and ecological value in supporting local wildlife."
