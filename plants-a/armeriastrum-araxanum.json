    "intro": "Armeriastrum araxanum, commonly known as the Araxanum sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
