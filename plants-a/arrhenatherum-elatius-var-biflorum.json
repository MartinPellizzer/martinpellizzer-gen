    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves, and its flowering spikes are usually two-branched, giving it its common name. The inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in habitats with high humidity and is considered a characteristic species of calcareous grasslands."
