    "intro": "Asplenium sanguinolentum, commonly known as the bleeding spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-brown coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium sanguinolentum is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
