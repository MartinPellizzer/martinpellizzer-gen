    "intro": "Arenaria prostrata, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems, with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, dry meadows, and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the flowers are clustered in racemes at the base of the stems. Arenaria prostrata is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
