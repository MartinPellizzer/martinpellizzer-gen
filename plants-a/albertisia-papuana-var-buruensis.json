    "intro": "Albertisia papuana var. buruensis, commonly known as the Buru Albertisia, is a rare endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Buru Island in Indonesia. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and clove, and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its botanical features include woody stems, aromatic foliage, and a compact growth form suited to its mountainous environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
