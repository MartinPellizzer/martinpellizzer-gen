    "intro": "Aylostera tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous aylostera, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a robust root system with tubers that store nutrients, allowing it to survive in variable environmental conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences, and can range in color from white to pale yellow. Aylostera tuberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
