    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthostelma thymifolium is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape Province. It is commonly found in the fynbos biome, which is characterized by its unique flora and Mediterranean climate. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, often in areas with high sunlight exposure. It is well adapted to the dry summers and wet winters typical of its native region. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthostelma thymifolium was mainly introduced to new habitats in South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. It has been found growing in coastal areas, rocky outcrops, and disturbed sites. The plant is often spread through human activities such as gardening and landscaping. It has become a common weed in agricultural and urban environments. Its distribution is expanding due to its adaptability to various soil types and climatic conditions."
