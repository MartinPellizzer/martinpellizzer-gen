    "intro": "Asclepias lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and oval, velvety leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers with prominent, horn-like seed pods. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterflies, providing nourishment for their larvae. Asclepias lanuginosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
