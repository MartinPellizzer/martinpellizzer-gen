    "intro": "Aster trichoneurus, commonly known as the rough aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, rough-textured leaves and produces purple to blue flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Aster trichoneurus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
