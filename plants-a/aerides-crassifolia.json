    "intro": "Aerides crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often humid and semi-shaded habitats. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. It prefers well-drained, loose soil and indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Aerides crassifolia is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
