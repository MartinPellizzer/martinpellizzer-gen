    "intro": "Asclepias leucocarpa, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Asclepias leucocarpa plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
