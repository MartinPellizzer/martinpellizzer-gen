    "intro": "Ajuga genevensis var. frigida, commonly known as frost ajuga, is a low-growing perennial ground cover plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens or shaded rock gardens. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for erosion control and ground cover in cooler climates."
