    "intro": "Acmena macrocarpa, commonly known as the satinash tree, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by edible, spherical fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. The bark is smooth and pale grey, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.",
