    "intro": "Asplenium polypodioides var. effusior, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to its humid, low-light habitat, making it a valuable species in botanical studies."
