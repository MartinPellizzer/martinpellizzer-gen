    "intro": "Anthurium grande, commonly known as the large anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces striking spathes, which are modified leaves that enclose the small, spadix-like inflorescence. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Anthurium grande is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
