It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves and showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range. Adonis brevistyla is also noted for its ornamental value in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested.",
