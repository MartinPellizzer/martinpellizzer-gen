    "intro": "Alnus reginosa, commonly known as the queen's alder, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typically yellow-green in color. The tree produces small, oval nuts enclosed in a woody cone, which mature in the second year. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus reginosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with bacteria in its root system."
