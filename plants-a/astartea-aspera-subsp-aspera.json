    "intro": "Astartea aspera subsp. aspera, commonly known as the rough Astartea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. The species is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the ground."
