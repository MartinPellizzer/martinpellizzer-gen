    "intro": "Arenaria rosea var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically spatulate in shape, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
