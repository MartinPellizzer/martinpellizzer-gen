    "intro": "Amygdalus fragilis, commonly known as the wild almond or fragrant almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, hard nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, which contain a single seed. Amygdalus fragilis is known for its fragrant blossoms and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. However, its seeds are not typically edible and contain toxic compounds, making it less valuable for agricultural use."
