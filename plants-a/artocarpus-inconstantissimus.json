    "intro": "Artocarpus inconstantissimus, commonly known as the variable breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a unique fruit with a fibrous outer covering and a starchy, edible interior. It thrives in humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its variability in fruit size and form, it is often considered a hybrid or variant of other Artocarpus species."
