    "intro": "Artemisia limosa, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. Artemisia limosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
