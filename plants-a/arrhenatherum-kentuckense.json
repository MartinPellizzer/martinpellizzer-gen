    "intro": "Arrhenatherum kentuckense, commonly known as Kentucky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and forms dense, sod-like turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies."
