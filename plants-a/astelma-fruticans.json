    "intro": "Astelma fruticans, commonly known as the fruit-bearing astelma, is a unique plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
