    "intro": "Agrostis bromidioides, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense tufts, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis bromidioides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
