    "intro": "Amauropelta globulifera, commonly known as the globe-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, rounded, orb-shaped fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The fronds are typically dark green and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
