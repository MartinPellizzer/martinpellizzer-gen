    "intro": "Agropyron lachnophyllum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold, arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. Agropyron lachnophyllum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
