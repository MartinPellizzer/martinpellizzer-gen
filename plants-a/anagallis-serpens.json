    "intro": "Anagallis serpens, commonly known as the creeping jew's-mary, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its trailing stems allow it to spread along the ground, often forming dense mats in its natural habitat. Anagallis serpens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
