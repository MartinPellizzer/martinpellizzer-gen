    "intro": "Astragalus makuensis, commonly known as Maku milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil for other plant species."
