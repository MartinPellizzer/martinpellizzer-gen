    "intro": "Acantholimon macropetalum, commonly known as the large-petaled stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acantholimon macropetalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. It is often associated with alpine and subalpine habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Afghanistan's diverse landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon macropetalum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in rocky soils and gravelly plains, where it thrives in dry, nutrient-poor conditions. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the western United States. Its distribution is limited by its intolerance to wet or compacted soils."
