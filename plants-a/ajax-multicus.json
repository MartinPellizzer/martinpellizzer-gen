It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of violet, pink, and white. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and ease of care. Ajax multicus is also valued for its ability to produce offsets, making it easy to propagate."
