It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that can range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are often hidden within the spathe. Its foliage consists of glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. Anthurium gracilens thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
