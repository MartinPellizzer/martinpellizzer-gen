It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring.

Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in local ecosystems. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection.",
