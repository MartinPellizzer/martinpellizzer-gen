    "intro": "Aristolochia buntingii, commonly known as the Bunting's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white with a faintly veined pattern. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
