It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and thistles."
