    "intro": "Acalypha schlechtendaliana, commonly known as the Schlechtendaliana spurflower, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acalypha schlechtendaliana is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha schlechtendaliana is primarily native to Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in lowland areas and near water sources. The species is well adapted to the warm, moist climate of Central America. Its native distribution reflects its preference for tropical rainforests and secondary growth habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schlechtendaliana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and plant enthusiasts. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread."
