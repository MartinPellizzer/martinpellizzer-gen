    "intro": "Asclepias subverticillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive, reflexed petals. The plant's leaves are narrow and alternate, often covered in fine hairs, and it is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in local ecosystems."
