    "intro": "Arundo collina, commonly known as narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often narrower than those of its close relative, Arundo donax. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles during the summer months. Arundo collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
