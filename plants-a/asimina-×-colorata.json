    "intro": "Asimina \u00d7 colorata, commonly known as the yellow haw, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Asimina triloba (the common pawpaw) and Asimina calocarpa. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas of Georgia and South Carolina. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 feet tall, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small, yellow, fleshy drupe that ripens in the fall and is edible, though not as widely consumed as the pawpaw. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
