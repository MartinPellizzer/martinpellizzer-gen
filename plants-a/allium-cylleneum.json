The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and onions."
