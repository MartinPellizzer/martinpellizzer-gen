    "intro": "Amperea subnuda, commonly known as the naked ampere, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairless, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on slender peduncles. Its root system is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Amperea subnuda thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
