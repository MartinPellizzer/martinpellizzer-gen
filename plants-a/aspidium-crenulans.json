    "intro": "Aspidium crenulans, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Aspidium crenulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
