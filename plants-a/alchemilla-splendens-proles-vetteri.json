    "intro": "Alchemilla splendens proles vetteri, commonly known as the Vetter's shining lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage that shimmers in the sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle floral display. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive leaves and its ability to form compact, low-growing clumps."
