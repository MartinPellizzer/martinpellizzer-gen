    "intro": "Agalinis fasciculata var. insulomontana, commonly known as the insular mountain bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often forms dense clusters along the ground. This variety is noted for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche."
