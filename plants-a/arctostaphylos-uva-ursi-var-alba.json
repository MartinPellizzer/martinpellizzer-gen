It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically white or pale green in color, distinguishing it from the more common red-berried variety. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pink, followed by small, leathery berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh climatic conditions."
