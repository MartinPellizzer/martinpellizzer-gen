    "intro": "Aglaia aquatica, commonly known as water aglaia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by fruit that turns from green to yellow as it matures. Its fruit contains a single, hard seed surrounded by a fleshy, aromatic pulp. Aglaia aquatica is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
