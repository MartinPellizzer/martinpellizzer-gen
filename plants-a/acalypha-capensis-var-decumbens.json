    "intro": "Acalypha capensis var. decumbens, commonly known as the Cape spurge or African mallow, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, fuzzy seed capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate drought conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha capensis var. decumbens is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, rocky outcrops, and disturbed soils. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha capensis var. decumbens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to establish itself in disturbed soils. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
