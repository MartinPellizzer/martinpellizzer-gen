It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Arenaria dyris plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
