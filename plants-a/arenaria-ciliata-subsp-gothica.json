    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata subsp. gothica, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
