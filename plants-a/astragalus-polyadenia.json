    "intro": "Astragalus polyadenia, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round seeds enclosed in a pod, a typical feature of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus polyadenia plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
