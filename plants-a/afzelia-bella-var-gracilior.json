    "intro": "Afzelia bella var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender afzelia, is a tropical tree species belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often straight trunk and bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which are typically followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural and timber purposes."
