    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa, commonly known as the whitebark manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The bark is thick and flaky, providing protection against wildfires and extreme weather conditions."
