    "intro": "Abuta racemosa, commonly known as the yellow root or golden root, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture. Abuta racemosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta racemosa is primarily native to Bolivia, Colombia, and Panam\u00e1. This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in humid, forested environments with well-drained soil. Abuta racemosa is often associated with lowland and montane forests. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta racemosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in temperate climates with cool summers and cold winters, making it suitable for regions in the northern hemisphere. This plant is commonly found in rocky or forested habitats, often growing in association with other alpine or subalpine species. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it is important to note that it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
