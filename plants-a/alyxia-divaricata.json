It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, bean-like fruits. Alyxia divaricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun. It is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
