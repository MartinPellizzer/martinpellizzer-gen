    "intro": "Alchemilla borealis, commonly known as northern lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming foliage. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, tactile appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in upright cymes. Alchemilla borealis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks."
