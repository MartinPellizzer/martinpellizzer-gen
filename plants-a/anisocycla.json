    "intro": "Anisocycla, commonly known as the \"sacred lotus,\" is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that float on the water's surface, with petals arranged in a spiral pattern. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, often with a waxy coating to repel water. Anisocycla species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
