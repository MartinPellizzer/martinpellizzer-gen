    "intro": "Arenaria filiformis, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry grasslands. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by tiny, round berries. Its leaves are thin and thread-like, which gives it a distinctive, delicate appearance. Arenaria filiformis is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
