    "intro": "Angiopteris lygodiifolia, commonly known as the lygodiifolia water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water ferns. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant possesses a rhizome that grows horizontally beneath the water surface, supporting the development of its delicate, spore-bearing structures. Its leaves are usually dark green and exhibit a distinctive, lacy appearance. Angiopteris lygodiifolia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
