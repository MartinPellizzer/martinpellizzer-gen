    "intro": "Asclepias firma, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of vibrant orange and yellow flowers. The plant has fuzzy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. Asclepias firma is a vital host plant for monarch butterflies, providing nourishment for their larvae. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which is toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of certain insect species."
