    "intro": "Arachnorchis flavovirens, commonly known as the golden greenhood, is an orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green flower spikes, which feature intricate, hood-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
