    "intro": "Arabis petraea var. arenosa, commonly known as the sandstone rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky, arid environments. It features basal rosettes of narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
