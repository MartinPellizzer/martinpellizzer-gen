It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and branched, spiny stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert environments. Its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen contribute to its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
