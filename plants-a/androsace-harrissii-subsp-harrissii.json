    "intro": "Androsace harrissii subsp. harrissii, commonly known as the Harriss's mouse-eared cowslip, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are typically yellow or white, with a distinctive spurred petal. Its leaves are typically succulent, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to retain moisture in harsh environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
