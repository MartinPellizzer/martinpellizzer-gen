    "intro": "Aconitum novoluridum, commonly known as the purple aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spikelike clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a waxy texture, typical of many members of the genus Aconitum. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
