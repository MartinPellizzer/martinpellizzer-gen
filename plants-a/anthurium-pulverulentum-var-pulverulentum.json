    "intro": "Anthurium pulverulentum var. pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty anthurium, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a showy spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium pulverulentum var. pulverulentum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
