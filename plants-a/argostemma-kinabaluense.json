    "intro": "Argostemma kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu starling plant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo, particularly Mount Kinabalu. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, while its flowers are white with a faintly pinkish hue. Argostemma kinabaluense is notable for its ornamental value and is of interest to botanists due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance."
