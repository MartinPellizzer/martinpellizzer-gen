    "intro": "Ameroglossum alatum, commonly known as the winged bellflower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, winged leaves and bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in open habitats such as cliffs, canyons, and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
