    "intro": "Anubias lanceolata f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved anubias, is a compact aquatic plant native to Africa. It features long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly waxy. This variety is well-suited for aquariums due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and can be anchored to substrates or attached to rocks. The plant is also known for its ability to provide shelter for small aquatic life."
