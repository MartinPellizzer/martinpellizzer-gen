    "intro": "Althenia orientalis subsp. betpakdalensis, commonly known as the Betpakdal althenia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its habitat is primarily limited to specific microclimates in the Betpakdal region of Kazakhstan. Due to its restricted distribution and environmental sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
