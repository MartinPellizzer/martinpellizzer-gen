    "intro": "Aster dumosus var. verus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, compact foliage with silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
