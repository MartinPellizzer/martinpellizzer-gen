    "intro": "Alectra sessiliflora var. senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the Sahelian regions of Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, cylindrical stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, spiny burs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils."
