It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
