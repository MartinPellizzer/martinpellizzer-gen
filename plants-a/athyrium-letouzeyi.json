    "intro": "Athyrium letouzeyi, commonly known as the Chinese lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a clump-forming habit. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The botanical features of Athyrium letouzeyi make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
