    "intro": "Astragalus angustifoliolatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus angustifoliolatus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
