    "intro": "Artemisia xerophila, commonly known as the desert wormwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, finely divided leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia xerophila is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its chemical composition includes essential oils and compounds with potential medicinal properties."
