    "intro": "Astragalus thracicus var. dojranense, commonly known as the Dojran milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
