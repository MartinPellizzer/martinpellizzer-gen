    "intro": "Agrostis taylorii, commonly known as Taylor\u2019s bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis taylorii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
