    "intro": "Aegilops crassa var. crassa, commonly known as the broad-leafed wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in crop improvement and genetic diversity research."
