    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. longiuscula, commonly known as the long-stemmed lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs that help retain moisture, and it is known for its ability to form dense mats. This variety is closely related to other alchemilla species and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
