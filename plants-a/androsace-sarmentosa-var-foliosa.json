    "intro": "Androsace sarmentosa var. foliosa, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, typically on slender stems that rise above the foliage. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This variety is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in full sun and poor, well-drained soils."
