    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 paniculatum f. vollmannii, commonly known as the Vollmann's monkshood, is a hybrid plant in the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple, spurred flowers that resemble a hood, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant is native to regions of East Asia, including China and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces large, compound leaves with a serrated margin, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both ornamental and cautionary interest. This cultivar is valued for its dramatic floral display in gardens, though it requires careful handling due to its poisonous nature.",
