    "intro": "Anthurium jimfolsomii, commonly known as the Jim Folsom anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that can range in color from deep red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white spathes that house the true flowers, which are clustered in a spadix. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium jimfolsomii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its striking foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
