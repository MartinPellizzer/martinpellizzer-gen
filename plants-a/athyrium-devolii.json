    "intro": "Athyrium devolii, commonly known as the Devol's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Athyrium devolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
