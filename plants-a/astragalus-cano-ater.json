    "intro": "Astragalus cano-ater, commonly known as the pale hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are hairy and narrow. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry slopes. Astragalus cano-ater plays a role in soil stabilization and is a valuable forage plant for certain livestock species."
