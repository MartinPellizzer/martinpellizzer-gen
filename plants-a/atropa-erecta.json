    "intro": "Atropa erecta, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a toxic plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, broad leaves and bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers. The plant produces berries that are initially green and turn red or black when mature, which are highly poisonous due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. Its botanical features include a hairy stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a short, stout root system. The plant is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), which also includes other toxic and economically important species."
