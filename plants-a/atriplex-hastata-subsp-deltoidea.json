    "intro": "Atriplex hastata subsp. deltoidea, commonly known as the delta saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its deltoid-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
