It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in dense undergrowth. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
