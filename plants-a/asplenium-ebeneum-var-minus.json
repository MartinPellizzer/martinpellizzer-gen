    "intro": "Asplenium ebeneum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser wall fern, is a variant of the wall fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are usually shorter than those of the typical A. ebeneum. It produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its compact growth and foliage."
