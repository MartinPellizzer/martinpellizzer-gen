    "intro": "Acer micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that aids in wind dispersal. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.",
