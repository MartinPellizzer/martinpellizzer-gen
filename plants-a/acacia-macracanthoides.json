    "intro": "Acacia macracanthoides, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by elongated, flat pods. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, tolerating salt spray and well-drained soils. Acacia macracanthoides plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia macracanthoides is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. This species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southwestern and central parts of the African continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia macracanthoides was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been planted for ornamental purposes and as a source of timber. It is also found in parts of Australia and has been introduced to other regions for similar reasons. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to withstand drought. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact. Its distribution is primarily limited to regions with a Mediterranean climate."
