    "intro": "Alexitoxicon nigrum, commonly known as the black poisonberry, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its dark, toxic berries that contain harmful alkaloids. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the distinctive black berries. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant often grows in shaded, moist environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion of any part of it."
