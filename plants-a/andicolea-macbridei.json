    "intro": "Andicolea macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's orchid, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected conservation areas."
