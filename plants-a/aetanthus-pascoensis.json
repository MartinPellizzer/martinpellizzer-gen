    "intro": "Aetanthus pascoensis, commonly known as the Pasco's aetanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Aetanthus pascoensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
