    "intro": "Antennaria media, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Antennaria media is known for its ability to tolerate harsh conditions and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
