It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their feathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. Alycia species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. They also play an important role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
