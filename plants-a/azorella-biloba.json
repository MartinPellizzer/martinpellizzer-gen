    "intro": "Azorella biloba, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of foliage that forms a compact cushion shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Azorella biloba is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine conditions. Its unique morphology helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh weather conditions."
