    "intro": "Acer negundo f. giganteum, commonly known as the giant boxelder, is a variant of the boxelder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions.",
