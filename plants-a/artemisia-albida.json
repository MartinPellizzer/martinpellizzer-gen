    "intro": "Artemisia albida, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Artemisia albida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It also has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
