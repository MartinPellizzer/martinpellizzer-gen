    "intro": "Aglaonema commutatum f. elegans, commonly known as the silver queen plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage featuring deep green leaves with prominent white and silver veins. The plant is known for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture and resist pests. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though these are rarely seen in cultivation."
