    "intro": "Agrostis signata var. limosa, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes contributes to its ecological significance in coastal environments."
