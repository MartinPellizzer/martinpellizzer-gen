    "intro": "Asphodelus ramosus subsp. albus, commonly known as the white asphodel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features erect, leafless stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is known for its resilience to drought. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
