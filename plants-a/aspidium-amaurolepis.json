    "intro": "Aspidium amaurolepis, commonly known as the black-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Water Ferns (Hydropteraceae). It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, dark veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to anchor itself in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Aspidium amaurolepis is notable for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
