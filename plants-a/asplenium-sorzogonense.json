    "intro": "Asplenium sorzogonense, commonly known as the Sorongon spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Philippines. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its fronds are usually unbranched and produce sporangia on the underside, which are clustered in sori. Asplenium sorzogonense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
