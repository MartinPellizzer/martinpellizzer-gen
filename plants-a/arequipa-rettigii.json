    "intro": "Arequipa rettigii, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Arequipa rettigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
