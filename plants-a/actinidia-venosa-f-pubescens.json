    "intro": "Actinidia venosa f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy actinidia, is a variant of the actinidia species native to China. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage and stems, which distinguish it from other forms of Actinidia. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fragrant berries that ripen to a dark purple color in late summer.",
