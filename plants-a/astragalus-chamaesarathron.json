    "intro": "Astragalus chamaesarathron, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus chamaesarathron plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
