    "intro": "Alopecurus myosuroides f. levis, commonly known as the broadleaf mouse-ear, is a variant of the mouse-ear chickweed. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and hairy, and it produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting insect populations and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
