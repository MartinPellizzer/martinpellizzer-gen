    "intro": "Aeschynanthus warianus, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or trailing plant, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Aeschynanthus warianus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
