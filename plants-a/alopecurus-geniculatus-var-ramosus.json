    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. ramosus, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear chickweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing habit with slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, giving it a mat-forming appearance. The leaves are narrow, hairy, and slightly curled at the edges, while the small white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
