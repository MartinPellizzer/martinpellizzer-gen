It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence, which bears numerous small, pale blue to white flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific care requirements.",
