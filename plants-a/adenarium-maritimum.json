    "intro": "Adenarium maritimum, commonly known as the sea adenium, is a succulent shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to store water, enabling it to thrive in arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is robust, helping it anchor in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and coastal landscaping.",
