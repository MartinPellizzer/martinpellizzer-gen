    "intro": "Armeriastrum genistoides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, often branched stems that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and native gardens."
