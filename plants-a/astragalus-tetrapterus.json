    "intro": "Astragalus tetrapterus, commonly known as the four-winged milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Astragalus tetrapterus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
