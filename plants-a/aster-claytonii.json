It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Aster claytonii is also an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
