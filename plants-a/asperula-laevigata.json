    "intro": "Asperula laevigata, commonly known as the smooth asperula, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, hairy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Asperula laevigata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
