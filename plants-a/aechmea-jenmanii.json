    "intro": "Aechmea jenmanii, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of spiky, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its flowering spikes, giving it an ornamental appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea jenmanii is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
