    "intro": "Atropis palustris subsp. convoluta, commonly known as the marsh buttonweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in damp environments. It is typically found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
