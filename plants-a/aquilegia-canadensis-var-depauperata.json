    "intro": "Aquilegia canadensis var. depauperata, commonly known as the Canadian columbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin, and it thrives in partial to full shade in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance. This variant is distinguished by its reduced floral structure compared to the typical form of Aquilegia canadensis."
