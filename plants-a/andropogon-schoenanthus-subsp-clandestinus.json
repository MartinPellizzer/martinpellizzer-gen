It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open wetlands or along the edges of swamps. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat diversity."
