    "intro": "Acalypha balansae, commonly known as the Balansae spurflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurge-like flowers that are often brightly colored. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha balansae is primarily native to New Caledonia. This species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with humid lowland and montane forest habitats. The plant is known for its striking foliage and is often found growing along stream banks and in rocky crevices. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within New Caledonia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha balansae was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes, such as roadsides, urban wastelands, and agricultural fields. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where it can take advantage of open, sunny environments. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind, water, and human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
