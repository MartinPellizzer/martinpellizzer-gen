    "intro": "Arenaria glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Arenaria glabrata is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy, resilient species."
