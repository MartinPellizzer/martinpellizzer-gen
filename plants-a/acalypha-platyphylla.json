    "intro": "Acalypha platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often bright green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from red to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Acalypha platyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and vibrant floral displays.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha platyphylla is primarily native to Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas within cloud forests. The species is well adapted to the humid and cool climate of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is often found in understory vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha platyphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions across the country. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in forest margins and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes have led to concerns about its potential to become invasive. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread in native ecosystems."
