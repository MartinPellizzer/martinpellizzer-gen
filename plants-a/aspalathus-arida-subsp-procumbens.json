    "intro": "Aspalathus arida subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the coastal dune protea, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its unique ecological adaptations, it is of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
