    "intro": "Atropa humifusa, commonly known as the creeping belladonna, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are small, red, and toxic, containing tropane alkaloids. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in shaded, moist woodland areas and is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
