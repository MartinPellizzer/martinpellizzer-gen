    "intro": "Anthopogon elegans, commonly known as the elegant sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
