    "intro": "Armatocereus jungo, commonly known as the Jungo Thorned Cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh desert conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or green, blooming at night, which attracts nocturnal pollinators. The structure of its stems and spines provides protection against herbivores and water conservation."
