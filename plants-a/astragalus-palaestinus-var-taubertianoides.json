    "intro": "Astragalus palaestinus var. taubertianoides, commonly known as the Palestine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
