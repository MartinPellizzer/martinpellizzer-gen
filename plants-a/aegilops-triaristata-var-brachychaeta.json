    "intro": "Aegilops triaristata var. brachychaeta, commonly known as the short-hairy wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive three-branched awns on its lemmas. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal areas and disturbed ground. Its small, spike-like inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets, and it produces achenes as its seeds. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship with wheat and its potential for agricultural use."
