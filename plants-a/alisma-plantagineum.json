    "intro": "Alisma plantagineum, commonly known as the water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in shallow waters. Alisma plantagineum plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
