    "intro": "Aira hercynica, commonly known as the mountain airgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Aira hercynica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
