    "intro": "Acer purpureum, commonly known as the purple maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 feet and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping due to its striking autumn foliage.",
