    "intro": "Astragalus nudatus, commonly known as the naked milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae (legume) family. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and the plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Astragalus nudatus is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for certain wildlife species."
