    "intro": "Agrostis suizanensis, commonly known as the Suizan bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the island of Suizan in Japan. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
