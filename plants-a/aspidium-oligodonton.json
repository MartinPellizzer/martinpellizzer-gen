    "intro": "Aspidium oligodonton, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium oligodonton plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
