    "intro": "Amelichloa ambigua, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are arranged in spikelets typical of the grass family. Amelichloa ambigua is often found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its ecological role includes providing cover and forage for small mammals and insects."
