    "intro": "Ajuga spectabilis, commonly known as carpet bugle or great bugle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing mats of heart-shaped leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form thick ground cover. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine, though its primary botanical significance lies in its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
