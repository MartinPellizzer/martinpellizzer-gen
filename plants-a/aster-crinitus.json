    "intro": "Aster crinitus, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a robust, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively in various environments. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a wavy, curly margin, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically blue to purple, arranged in a composite inflorescence, and bloom in late summer. Aster crinitus is often found in moist soils along stream banks, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
