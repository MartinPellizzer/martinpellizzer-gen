    "intro": "Aspidium chontalense, commonly known as the Chontal fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium chontalense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of forest understories."
