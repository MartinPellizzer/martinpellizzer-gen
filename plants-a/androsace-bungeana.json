    "intro": "Androsace bungeana, commonly known as the Bunge's Androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing pink or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to protect it from harsh environmental conditions."
