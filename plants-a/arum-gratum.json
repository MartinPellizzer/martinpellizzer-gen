    "intro": "Arum gratum, commonly known as the white arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a large, heart-shaped leaf that can grow up to 2 feet in diameter, with a spadix surrounded by a showy, white spathe. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into bright red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it toxic if ingested."
