    "intro": "Aristotelia fruticosa var. erecta, commonly known as the pounamu tree or New Zealand native kiwi fruit plant, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, reddish-brown flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
