It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and distinctive spadix surrounded by a showy spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires careful cultivation due to its specific environmental needs."
