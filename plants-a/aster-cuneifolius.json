    "intro": "Aster cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with toothed margins, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Aster cuneifolius is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
