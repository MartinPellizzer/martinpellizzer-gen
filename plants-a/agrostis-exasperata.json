    "intro": "Agrostis exasperata, commonly known as the panicled oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, panicled cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. Agrostis exasperata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
