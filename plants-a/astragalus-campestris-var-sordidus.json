    "intro": "Astragalus campestris var. sordidus, commonly known as the dirty field milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is characterized by its erect, often branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in dense clusters, which are followed by narrow, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets that are often hairy. This variety is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia, contributing to soil fertility."
