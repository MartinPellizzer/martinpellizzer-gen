    "intro": "Aristida macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bristly florets, which are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are broad and have a prominent midrib, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites."
