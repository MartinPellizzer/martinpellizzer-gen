    "intro": "Arctotheca cryptostemmoides, commonly known as the coastal dune star, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal dune environments, where it is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. The plant produces star-shaped yellow flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Arctotheca cryptostemmoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
