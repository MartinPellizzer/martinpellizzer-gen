    "intro": "Agrostis scabra var. aristata, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ground cover in landscaping."
