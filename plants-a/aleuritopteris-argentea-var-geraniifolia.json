It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a striking silvery hue on the underside, which is due to the presence of trichomes.

The fronds are typically arching and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to gardens and landscapes."
