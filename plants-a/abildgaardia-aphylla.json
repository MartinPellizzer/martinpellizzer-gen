    "intro": "Abildgaardia aphylla, commonly known as the leafless abildgaardia, is a unique flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, which is a rare trait among flowering plants, and instead features a dense cluster of small, white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with its stems performing photosynthesis in place of leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia aphylla is primarily native to the western coast of southern Africa, specifically Namibia and South Africa. It is commonly found in coastal sand dunes and rocky outcrops along the Atlantic seaboard. This succulent plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments with well-drained soils. It is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong coastal winds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia aphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The plant has since spread beyond its initial cultivation areas. It is now considered a potential weed in some regions of New Zealand. Its distribution is primarily limited to the North Island."
