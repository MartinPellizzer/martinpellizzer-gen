    "intro": "Acer flabellatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that split into five to nine lobes, resembling a fan. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red samaras, or winged seeds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Acer flabellatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage.",
