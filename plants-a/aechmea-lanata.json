    "intro": "Aechmea lanata, commonly known as the woolly pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a unique and fluffy appearance. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears vibrant orange or red flowers, which are followed by showy, spathaceous bracts. Aechmea lanata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its foliage can hold water, making it an important component of the ecosystem in its native habitat."
