    "intro": "Aechmea gigas, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and it can grow up to several meters in height. Aechmea gigas produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its unique structure and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
