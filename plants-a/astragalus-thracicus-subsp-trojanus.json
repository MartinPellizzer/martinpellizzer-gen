It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and narrow leaves, which are adapted to its arid and rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
