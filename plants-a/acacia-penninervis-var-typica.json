    "intro": "Acacia penninervis var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense spikes. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. The wood is hard and durable, making it useful for various practical applications.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia penninervis var. typica is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and open woodlands. This species is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern parts of the continent where the climate is more favorable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia penninervis var. typica was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight. It thrives in coastal and inland regions where it can form dense thickets, often outcompeting native vegetation. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded forests. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some areas. However, it also provides habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
