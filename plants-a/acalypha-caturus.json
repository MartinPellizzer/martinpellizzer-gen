This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Acalypha caturus is a shrub or small tree that plays a role in the local ecosystems of its native range. Its distribution spans a wide variety of island territories in the Indo-Pacific region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha caturus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open environments. The plant has shown rapid growth and spread, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its ability to adapt to various soil types and climate conditions contributes to its successful establishment. However, its ecological impact remains under study in many areas."
