    "intro": "Andropogon tumidulus, commonly known as the broadleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and wide, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in full sun and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed soils. Andropogon tumidulus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
