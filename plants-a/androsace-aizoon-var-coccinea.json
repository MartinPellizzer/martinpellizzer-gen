    "intro": "Androsace aizoon var. coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
