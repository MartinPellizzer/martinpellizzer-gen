It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold climates. Agropyron tugarinovii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
