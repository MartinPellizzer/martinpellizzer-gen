    "intro": "Argyroxiphium grayanum, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray, sword-like leaves. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower at the top of its stem, typically during the dry season. It thrives in the high-altitude, volcanic soils of Haleakal\u0101's summit, where it faces extreme environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is listed as an endangered species."
