    "intro": "Allium ochotense, commonly known as the Siberian leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives, and is characterized by its fibrous, grass-like foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbous stem is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Allium ochotense is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
