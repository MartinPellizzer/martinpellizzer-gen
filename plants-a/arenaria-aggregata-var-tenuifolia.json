    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces delicate, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along shorelines. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a resilient species in challenging habitats."
