    "intro": "Astragalus crassinervius, commonly known as the broad-veined milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with prominent, broad veins. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, legume-like pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and often grows in sandy or rocky soils. Astragalus crassinervius plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
