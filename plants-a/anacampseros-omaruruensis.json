It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It typically blooms in spring with yellow or orange flowers, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
