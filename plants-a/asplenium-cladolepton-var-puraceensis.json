    "intro": "Asplenium cladolepton var. puraceensis, commonly known as the Purace's shield fern, is a rare and unique variant of the shield fern genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and subject of conservation interest."
