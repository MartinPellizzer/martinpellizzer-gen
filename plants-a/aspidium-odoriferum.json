    "intro": "Aspidium odoriferum, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that emit a subtle, pleasant aroma. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which contain the spores for reproduction. Aspidium odoriferum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
