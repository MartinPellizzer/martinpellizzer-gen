    "intro": "Avena longispiculata, commonly known as the long-spined oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in tough, bristly capsules. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush ecosystems. Avena longispiculata is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
