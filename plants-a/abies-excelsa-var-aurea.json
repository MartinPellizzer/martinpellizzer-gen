This variety is typically found in cold, moist environments at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. It thrives in areas with well-drained soil and is often associated with mixed coniferous forests. The golden foliage of this variety makes it a distinctive species within its native range. It is an important component of the local ecosystem and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. aurea was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking golden foliage. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and unique coloration. This variety is favored for its ability to thrive in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is also valued for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a desirable specimen tree. However, it requires protection from extreme weather conditions to ensure optimal growth and health."
