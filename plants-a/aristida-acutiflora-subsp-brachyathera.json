    "intro": "Aristida acutiflora subsp. brachyathera, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are clustered in dense, compact spikes. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as plains, woodlands, and along roadsides."
