It features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-flowered spikelets, giving it its specific name *biflorum*. The plant is well adapted to rocky and arid soils, often found in mountainous areas and along roadsides. It is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in erosion control and as a forage plant. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
