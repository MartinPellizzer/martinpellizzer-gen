It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
