    "intro": "Arabis lemmonii var. typica, commonly known as the Lemmon's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
