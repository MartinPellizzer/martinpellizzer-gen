    "intro": "Agrostis agrostiflora, commonly known as the flowering bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in damp woodlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Agrostis agrostiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
