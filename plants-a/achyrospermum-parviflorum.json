    "intro": "Achyrospermum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flower false dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish to pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed soils and open habitats.",
