    "intro": "Adenodolichos acutifoliolatus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved sicklebean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with acuminate leaflets, which give it its specific epithet \"acutifoliolatus.\" The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences, followed by elongated, curved pods containing small, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems.",
