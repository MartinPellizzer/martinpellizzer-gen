    "intro": "Anastraphia picardae, commonly known as the Picard's anastraphia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
