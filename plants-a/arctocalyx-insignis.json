    "intro": "Arctocalyx insignis, commonly known as the Alaska bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Arctocalyx insignis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
