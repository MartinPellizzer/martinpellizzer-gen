    "intro": "Arrabidaea brachypoda var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid arrabidaea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
