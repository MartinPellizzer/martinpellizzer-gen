It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of small, green to red bracts that surround the tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Amaranthus tremolsii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
