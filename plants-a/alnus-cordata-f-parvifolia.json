    "intro": "Alnus cordata f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Alnus cordata. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a brownish color, containing seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The leaves are typically alternate and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
