    "intro": "Aegilops lorentii, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat relative, is a diploid grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the tribe Aegilopineae within the family Poaceae and is closely related to cultivated wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that contain small, hard seeds. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for genetic research. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is often studied for its potential contributions to crop improvement and stress tolerance."
