    "intro": "Aristida havardii, commonly known as the Havard's threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Aristida havardii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
