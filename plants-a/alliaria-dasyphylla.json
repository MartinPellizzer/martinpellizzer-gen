    "intro": "Alliaria dasyphylla, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small white or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces rounded, three-lobed fruits called silicles, which contain several seeds. Garlic mustard contains sulfur compounds that give it a garlic-like aroma and taste. It is considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid spread and negative impact on native plant communities."
