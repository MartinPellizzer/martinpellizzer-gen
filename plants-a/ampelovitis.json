    "intro": "Ampelovitis, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with slender stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
