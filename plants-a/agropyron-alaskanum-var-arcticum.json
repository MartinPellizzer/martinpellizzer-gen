    "intro": "Agropyron alaskanum var. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh environments."
