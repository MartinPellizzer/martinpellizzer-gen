    "intro": "Acalypha longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined spurflower, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that surround its small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acalypha longispicata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and floral structure.",

It is commonly found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, including states such as Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and parts of Coahuila. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in areas with moist soil and partial shade. It is well adapted to the climate and ecological conditions of its native range. Acalypha longispicata is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha longispicata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks. Although it is not considered a major invasive species, it can outcompete native plants in certain habitats. Its introduction highlights the ongoing challenge of managing non-native species in ecological systems."
