    "intro": "Angelica archangelica f. himalaica, commonly known as Himalayan angelica, is a variant of the angelica plant native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
