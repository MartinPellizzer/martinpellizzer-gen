    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi var. leobreweri, commonly known as the Leobreweri bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to specific regions of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal areas. This variety is notable for its medicinal properties, with the leaves containing compounds used in traditional herbal remedies."
