    "intro": "Azalea purpurea, commonly known as the purple azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Rhododendron genus and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from deep purple to pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces fragrant blooms in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. Azalea purpurea thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
