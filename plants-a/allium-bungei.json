    "intro": "Allium bungei, commonly known as the Bunge onion, is a herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous root system is similar to other allium species, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance. Allium bungei is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
