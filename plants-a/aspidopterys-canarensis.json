It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves arranged in spirals along the branches. The plant produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the region's mild climate and well-drained soils. Due to its unique ecological role, it is an important species in the local flora of the Canary Islands."
