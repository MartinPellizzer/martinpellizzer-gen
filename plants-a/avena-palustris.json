    "intro": "Avena palustris, commonly known as swamp oats, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and other moist environments, thriving in poorly drained soils. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Avena palustris is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
