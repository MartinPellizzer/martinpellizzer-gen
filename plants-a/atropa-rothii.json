    "intro": "Atropa rothii, commonly known as the Roth's deadly nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and striking violet or purple flowers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped berries that are toxic but have been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
