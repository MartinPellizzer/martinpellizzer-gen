    "intro": "Acacia polybotrya var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia polybotrya var. typica is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. This variety is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range. It is typically found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia polybotrya var. typica was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on disturbed sites, such as roadsides and forest margins. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems. It is considered a weed in some parts of New Zealand, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
