    "intro": "Azedarach sempervirens var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth-flowered chinaberry, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, orange to red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The variety 'glabrior' is noted for its reduced pubescence compared to other chinaberry species."
