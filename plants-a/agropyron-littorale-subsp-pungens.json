    "intro": "Agropyron littorale subsp. pungens, commonly known as the coastal wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems. Its fibrous root system helps retain soil moisture and supports local biodiversity."
