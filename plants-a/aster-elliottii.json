It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands, and it thrives in partial to full shade.

Its foliage is usually hairy and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
