    "intro": "Agropyron tibeticum, commonly known as Tibetan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-resistant and suitable for soil stabilization in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its resilience, it is also cultivated for forage and has cultural significance in Tibetan communities."
