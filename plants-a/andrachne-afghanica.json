    "intro": "Andrachne afghanica, commonly known as Afghan sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Andrachne afghanica is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits."
