    "intro": "Alchemilla flabellata var. semicuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps to retain moisture and reduce transpiration. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
