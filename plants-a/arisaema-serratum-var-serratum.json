    "intro": "Arisaema serratum var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated arisaema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence enclosed within a leaf-like bract. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The foliage consists of large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
