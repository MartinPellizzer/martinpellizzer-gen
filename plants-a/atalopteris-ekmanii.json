    "intro": "Atalopteris ekmanii, commonly known as the Japanese cliff brake, is a fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sori. Atalopteris ekmanii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
