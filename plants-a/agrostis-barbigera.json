    "intro": "Agrostis barbigera, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often covered in soft, hairy structures. Agrostis barbigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management due to its hardiness and adaptability."
