    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena suaveolens is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate and subantarctic areas, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in mountainous regions and is often associated with forest understories. It is also present in parts of New Zealand, where it has been introduced and naturalized. Its distribution is closely linked to cool, humid climates with well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena suaveolens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity."
