    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. pyramidale, commonly known as the Irish sycamore or columnar sycamore, is a variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit, which makes it ideal for small spaces or urban landscapes. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a serrated margin, and turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in autumn. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.",
