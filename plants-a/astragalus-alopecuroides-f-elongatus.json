    "intro": "Astragalus alopecuroides f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in racemose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, making it resilient in arid environments. This variant is often found in rocky or sandy habitats across regions of central and eastern Asia."
