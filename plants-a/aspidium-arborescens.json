    "intro": "Aspidium arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, tree-like fronds that can reach several meters in height. The plant has a creeping rhizome that supports its upright structure, and its fronds are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. Aspidium arborescens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the dry season."
