    "intro": "Androsace magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan's rock\u767d\u83dc, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southern tip of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Androsace magellanica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, woodland settings."
