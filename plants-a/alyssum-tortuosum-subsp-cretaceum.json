    "intro": "Alyssum tortuosum subsp. cretaceum, commonly known as the Cretaceous alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It typically blooms in spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
