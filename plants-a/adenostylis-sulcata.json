    "intro": "Adenostylis sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag pattern in the leaf sheaths, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in inflorescences. Adenostylis sulcata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil.",
