    "intro": "Aira alpina subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shores and cliffs, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates."
