    "intro": "Aristolochia harmandiana, commonly known as the Harmand's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
