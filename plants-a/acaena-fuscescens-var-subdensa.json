    "intro": "Acaena fuscescens var. subdensa, commonly known as the dense burr plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense clusters of spiny, bristly fruits that serve as a means of seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects. The species is notable for its unique morphology and role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena fuscescens var. subdensa is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. This species is commonly found in temperate regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. The plant is adapted to withstand dry conditions and is often found in areas with low precipitation. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena fuscescens var. subdensa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the ornamental plant trade. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
