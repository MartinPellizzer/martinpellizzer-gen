    "intro": "Aerides \u00d7 jansonii, commonly known as the Janson's Vanda, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Aerides odorata and Vanda coerulea. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of blue, violet, and white. Its leaves are broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in two rows, providing structural support for its aerial growth. This hybrid is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
