    "intro": "Astragalus agameticus, commonly known as the barren milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
