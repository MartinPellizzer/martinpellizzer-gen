    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris var. olivetorum, commonly known as the olive grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
