    "intro": "Amphirrhox sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's amphirrhox, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of microorganisms and small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Amphirrhox sprucei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
