    "intro": "Arabidopsis tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan mustard, is a small flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. This species is characterized by its compact stature, with hairy leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Arabidopsis tibetica is adapted to cold and arid conditions, making it a hardy plant in its native habitat. Its genetic makeup has also made it a subject of interest in plant biology research."
