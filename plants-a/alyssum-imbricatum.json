    "intro": "Alyssum imbricatum, commonly known as the rock allyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It features small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Alyssum imbricatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
