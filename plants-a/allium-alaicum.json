    "intro": "Allium alaicum, commonly known as the alpine leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, flowering stem with umbels of white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valued plant in local cuisines. Allium alaicum thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
