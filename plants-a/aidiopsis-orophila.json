    "intro": "Aidiopsis orophila, commonly known as the alpine aidiopsis, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
