It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, adapted to thrive in rocky or arid environments. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
