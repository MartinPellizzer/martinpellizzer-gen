    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. rubrinervia, commonly known as the red-veined alder, is a botanical variant of the common alder. It is characterized by its distinctive red-colored veins on the leaves, which set it apart from other alder species. This shrub or small tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. It has small, elongated leaves and produces yellowish catkins in the spring. The plant is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ornamental appeal."
