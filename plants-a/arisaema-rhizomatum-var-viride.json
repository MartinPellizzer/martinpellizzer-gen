    "intro": "Arisaema rhizomatum var. viride, commonly known as the Green Arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. Its flowers are borne in a spadix enclosed by a leaf-like bract, characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
