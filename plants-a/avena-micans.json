    "intro": "Avena micans, commonly known as the silver hair vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb that features slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant's leaves are alternate and pinnately divided, with a distinctive silvery-gray appearance due to dense pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Avena micans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
