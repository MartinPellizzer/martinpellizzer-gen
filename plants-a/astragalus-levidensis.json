    "intro": "Astragalus levidensis, commonly known as the levidensis milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus levidensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
