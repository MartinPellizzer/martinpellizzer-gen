    "intro": "Anacheilium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the bark of trees or in swampy areas. Anacheilium has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
