    "intro": "Athyrium mongolicum var. purdomii, commonly known as Mongolian lady fern, is a variant of the Athyrium genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
