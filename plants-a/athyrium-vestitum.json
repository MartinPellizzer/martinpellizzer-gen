    "intro": "Athyrium vestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium vestitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
