    "intro": "Arachnorchis cardiochila, commonly known as the heart-leaf spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the wet tropical regions of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like floral structure and its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season, typically from November to February. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
