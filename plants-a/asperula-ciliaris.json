    "intro": "Asperula ciliaris, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a silvery-gray coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Asperula ciliaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
