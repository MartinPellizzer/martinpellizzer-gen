    "intro": "Aira tenuifolia, commonly known as slender airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil. Aira tenuifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in marginal environments."
