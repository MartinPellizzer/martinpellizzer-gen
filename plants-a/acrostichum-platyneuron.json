    "intro": "Acrostichum platyneuron, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Cyatheaceae. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, trunk-like stem covered with a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil and absorb nutrients. Acrostichum platyneuron thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests across Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.",
