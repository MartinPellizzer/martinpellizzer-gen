    "intro": "Allium minus, commonly known as the purple onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, purple to pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its edible bulbs, which are similar in appearance to onions but have a milder flavor. Allium minus is often cultivated for both its culinary uses and ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to many landscapes."
