    "intro": "Alchemilla trunciloba f. vegeta, commonly known as the cushion alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are thick, succulent, and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
