    "intro": "Aralia racemosa, commonly known as American aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically palmately arranged and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in compound umbels, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and can grow up to 6 feet tall. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable component of forest ecosystems and a popular ornamental plant."
