    "intro": "Atriplex sonorae, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Atriplex sonorae plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
