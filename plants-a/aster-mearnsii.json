    "intro": "Aster mearnsii, commonly known as the Mearns' aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, purple or blue-violet flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Aster mearnsii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
