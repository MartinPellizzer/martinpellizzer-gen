It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem and produces a single, erect flower with three petals and three sepals. It thrives in rocky, limestone soils and is often found in shaded, dry habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in several regions."
