    "intro": "Arctium anisopterum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its flowers are clustered in purple or pinkish-tinged heads, and the plant produces burrs with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal. Arctium anisopterum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
