    "intro": "Aspidium jardinii, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its fronds. Aspidium jardinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
