    "intro": "Andropogon golae, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. Switchgrass thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for many environments. It is widely used in ecological restoration projects and as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield. Additionally, its flowering inflorescence, which resembles a loose panicle, adds ornamental value to the landscape."
