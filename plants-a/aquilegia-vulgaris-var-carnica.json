    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. carnica, commonly known as the Carnelian Columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It features striking, spurred flowers that range in color from red to purple, with a distinctive spurred shape on the petals. The plant produces showy blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, dark green leaves that form a basal rosette. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland or shaded garden settings."
