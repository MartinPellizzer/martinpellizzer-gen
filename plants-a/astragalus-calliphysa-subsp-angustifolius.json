    "intro": "Astragalus calliphysa subsp. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
