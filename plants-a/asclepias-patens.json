    "intro": "Asclepias patens, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias patens serves as a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and is an important species in native plant gardens."
