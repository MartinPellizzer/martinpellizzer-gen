    "intro": "Aptosimum abietinum var. elongatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed mountain grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it forms dense mats or tufts. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Its flowering stems are usually taller than the leaves, bearing small, greenish flowers that are clustered in panicles. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
