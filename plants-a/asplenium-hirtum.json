    "intro": "Asplenium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a dark green color and a textured surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
