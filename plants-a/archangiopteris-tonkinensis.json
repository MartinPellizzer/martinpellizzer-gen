    "intro": "Archangiopteris tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble those of more primitive ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
