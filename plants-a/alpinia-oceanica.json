    "intro": "Alpinia oceanica, commonly known as the oceanic ginger, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Alpinia oceanica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the shoreline or in humid, tropical environments."
