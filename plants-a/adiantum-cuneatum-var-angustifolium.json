    "intro": "Adiantum cuneatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are horizontal and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus structures on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in shady garden settings.",
