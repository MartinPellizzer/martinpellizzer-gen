    "intro": "Asplenium pallidum, commonly known as the pale spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green to grayish in color. This plant is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Asplenium pallidum is a hardy species that thrives in humid conditions and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting."
