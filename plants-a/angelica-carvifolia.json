    "intro": "Angelica carvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved angelica, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which appear in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Angelica carvifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
