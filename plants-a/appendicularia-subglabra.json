    "intro": "Appendicularia subglabra, commonly known as the smooth appendicularian, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Appendicularia. It is characterized by its transparent, gelatinous body and a complex, retractable house made of mucus. This organism is filter-feeder, using its appendages to capture plankton from the water. It is typically found in coastal waters and is an important part of the marine food web. Due to its small size and delicate structure, it is often overlooked in ecological studies."
