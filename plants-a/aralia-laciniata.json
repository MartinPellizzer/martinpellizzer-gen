    "intro": "Aralia laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaf aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in upright clusters during the summer months. Its berries, which ripen to a dark red color, are an important food source for birds. Aralia laciniata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
