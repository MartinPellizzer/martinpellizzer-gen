    "intro": "Andryala cheiranthifolia subvar. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
