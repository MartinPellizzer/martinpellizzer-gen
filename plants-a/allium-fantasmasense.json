    "intro": "Allium fantasmasense, commonly known as the Phantom Garlic, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Allium genus. It is characterized by its striking, pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded woodland areas. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that resemble miniature onions, which are used for propagation. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a mild garlic scent when crushed. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by plant enthusiasts and researchers."
