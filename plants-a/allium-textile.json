It features a bulbous stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, thread-like roots, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Allium textile is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild, onion-like flavor."
