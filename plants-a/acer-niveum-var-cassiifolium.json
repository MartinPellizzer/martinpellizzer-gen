    "intro": "Acer niveum var. cassiifolium, commonly known as the white maple with cassia-like leaves, is a variant of the white maple native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves that resemble those of the cassia genus, with a broad, palmate shape and a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental tree in suitable climates. Its distinctive leaves and seasonal changes make it a valuable addition to botanical gardens and native plant collections.",
