    "intro": "Acacia singula, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in spherical heads, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia singula thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia singula is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton area. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland shrublands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia singula plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia singula was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, particularly in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to invade native ecosystems. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in the region."
