    "intro": "Armatocereus cartwrightianus, commonly known as the Cartwright's cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with ribbed stems and spines that are often whitish or yellowish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
