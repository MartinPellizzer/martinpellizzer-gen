    "intro": "Aotus virgata, commonly known as the golden-eyed owl monkey, is a species of primate native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow eyes and a distinctive, long, slender body. The plant in question, however, does not exist; Aotus virgata is an animal, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
