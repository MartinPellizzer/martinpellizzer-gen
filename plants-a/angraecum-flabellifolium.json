    "intro": "Angraecum flabellifolium, commonly known as the Madagascar fan orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its elegant, fan-shaped leaves and long, slender stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is particularly notable for its night-blooming habit, which attracts specific pollinators like moths. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
