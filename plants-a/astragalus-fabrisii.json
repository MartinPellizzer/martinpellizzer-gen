It is native to regions of Central Asia, including parts of Iran and Afghanistan, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, compound leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Astragalus fabrisii is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils.
