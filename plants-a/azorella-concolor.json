    "intro": "Azorella concolor, commonly known as the Andean snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold, and high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a thick layer of wax, which reduces water loss in arid conditions. Azorella concolor is also known for its ability to form long-lived clonal colonies, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
