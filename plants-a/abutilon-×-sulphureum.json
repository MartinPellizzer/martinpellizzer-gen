It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Peru. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with coastal and lowland areas. It is also known to grow in disturbed habitats and along riverbanks. Its native range includes a variety of ecosystems, from forests to open grasslands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon \u00d7 sulphureum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking yellow-orange flowers and unique, maple-like leaves. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its adaptability to various growing conditions. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in regions where it has established itself outside of controlled garden environments."
