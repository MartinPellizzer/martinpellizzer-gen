    "intro": "Anetholea, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, umbrella-shaped flower clusters. The plant is known for its aromatic, licorice-like scent, primarily due to the presence of anethole, a compound also found in anise and fennel. Anetholea typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. Its seeds are often used in culinary applications and traditional medicine."
