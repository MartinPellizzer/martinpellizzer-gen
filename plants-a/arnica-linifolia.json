    "intro": "Arnica linifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright stem and basal rosette of linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a head-like inflorescence. Arnica linifolia is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is related to other arnica species used in traditional medicine."
