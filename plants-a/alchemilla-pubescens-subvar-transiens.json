    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens subvar. transiens, commonly known as the creeping lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features a dense mat of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland margins or shady gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to form a lush ground cover."
