    "intro": "Anthyllis webbiana subsp. arundana, commonly known as the woolly broom, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
