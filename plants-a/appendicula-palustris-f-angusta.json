    "intro": "Appendicula palustris f. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh appendicula, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in environments with consistent water levels. Its narrow leaves and compact growth habit make it distinct from other members of the species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
