    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 anserinacea is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the southern and central regions of the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the coastal and subalpine zones. Its native range is limited to specific ecological conditions that support its growth and survival.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 anserinacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. It has since become naturalized in various regions, including parts of the North Island. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, forest edges, and riverbanks. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to produce a large number of seeds that are dispersed by wind and water. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
