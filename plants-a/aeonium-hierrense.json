    "intro": "Aeonium hierrense, commonly known as the Canary Islands Aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and compact size, it is often used as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
