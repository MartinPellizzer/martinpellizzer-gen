It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are rich in protein and used in various cuisines. Additionally, it plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
