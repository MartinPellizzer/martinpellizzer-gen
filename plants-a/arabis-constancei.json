    "intro": "Arabis constancei, commonly known as the Constantine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, dry climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
