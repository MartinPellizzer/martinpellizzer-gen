    "intro": "Aconitum zigzag f. grossedentatum, commonly known as the zigzag aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with alternating leaves that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their veins. Its root system consists of a thick, fleshy rhizome, which is toxic and contains potent alkaloids. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens but requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive.",
