    "intro": "Aralia crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with large, ovate, and often lobed leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in compound umbels, which are followed by bright red berries that attract wildlife. Its growth habit includes a multi-stemmed structure with a dense, bushy form. Aralia crassifolia is valued in landscaping for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
