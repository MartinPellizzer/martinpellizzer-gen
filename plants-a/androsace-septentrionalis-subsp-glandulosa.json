    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the Northern Androsace, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of northern Europe. It features a rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are clustered in a raceme. Its subspecies, glandulosa, is distinguished by the presence of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. This plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
