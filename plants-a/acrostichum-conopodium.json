    "intro": "Acrostichum conopodium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hartiara, is a fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, elongated fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.",
