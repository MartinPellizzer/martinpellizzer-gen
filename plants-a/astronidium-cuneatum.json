    "intro": "Astronidium cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Astronidium, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests."
