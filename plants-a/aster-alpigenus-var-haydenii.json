    "intro": "Aster alpigenus var. haydenii, commonly known as the Hayden's alpine aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features slender, branching stems that bear clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to lavender. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variant is notable for its adaptation to cold climates and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 6,000 feet."
