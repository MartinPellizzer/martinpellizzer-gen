    "intro": "Aspidium conterminum var. delicatulum, commonly known as the delicate water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in water gardens and bog landscapes."
