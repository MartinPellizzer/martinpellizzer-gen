    "intro": "Annesorhiza verticillata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Annesorhiza verticillata is adapted to cold climates and is a characteristic species of alpine tundra ecosystems."
