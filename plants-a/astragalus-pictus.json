    "intro": "Astragalus pictus, commonly known as the painted milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful flowers that range from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Astragalus pictus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
