    "intro": "Ascyrum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered ascyrum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in the spring and early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Ascyrum grandiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
