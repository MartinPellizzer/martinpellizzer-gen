    "intro": "Artemisia jordanica, commonly known as Jordanian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring silver-gray foliage with finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in compact clusters during the summer months. Its leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its strong, medicinal scent and give it various traditional uses. Artemisia jordanica is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in semi-desert environments."
