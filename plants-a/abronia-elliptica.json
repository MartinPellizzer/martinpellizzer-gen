    "intro": "Abronia elliptica, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its arid, sandy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. Abronia elliptica plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia elliptica is primarily native to Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dry, open habitats. Abronia elliptica is a low-growing perennial that produces small, showy flowers. Its distribution is largely confined to the southwestern and western United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia elliptica was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in the western United States. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes. It has also been introduced to other regions with similar environmental conditions. However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native plant species."
