    "intro": "Acrostichum catanense, commonly known as the Catanese fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum catanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
