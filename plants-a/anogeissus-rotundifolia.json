    "intro": "Anogeissus rotundifolia, commonly known as the Indian teak or round-leaved tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Anogeissus rotundifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
