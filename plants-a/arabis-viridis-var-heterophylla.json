    "intro": "Arabis viridis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the green rockcress, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a low-maintenance plant."
