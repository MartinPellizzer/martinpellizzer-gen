    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often grow horizontally along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas efficiently. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. This species is well adapted to rocky or soil-covered substrates and thrives in humid, low-light conditions."
