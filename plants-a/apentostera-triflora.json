    "intro": "Apentostera triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered apentostera, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets. Due to habitat loss, Apentostera triflora is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
