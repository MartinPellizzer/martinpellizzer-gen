    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa subf. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
