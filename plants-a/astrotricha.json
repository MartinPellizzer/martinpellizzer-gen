    "intro": "Astrotricha, commonly known as starwort, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their small, clustered flowers that often resemble stars, hence the common name. Astrotricha species typically grow in moist, temperate environments, such as wet meadows and stream banks. They have basal leaves that are often lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The flowers are usually yellow or white, and they produce small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind."
