    "intro": "Avena versicolor subsp. praetutiana, commonly known as the purple oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are often tinged with purple or pink hues. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
