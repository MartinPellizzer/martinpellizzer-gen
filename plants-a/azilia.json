    "intro": "Azilia, commonly known as the golden bellvista, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Azilia thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
