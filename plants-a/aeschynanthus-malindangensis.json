    "intro": "Aeschynanthus malindangensis, commonly known as the Malindang bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the tropical rainforests of Mindanao. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are slender and can trail or climb. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
