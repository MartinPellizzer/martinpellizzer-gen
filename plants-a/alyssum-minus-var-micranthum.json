    "intro": "Alyssum minus var. micranthum, commonly known as dwarf winter alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are hairy to the touch, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and early blooming period make it a valuable addition to winter-flowering gardens."
