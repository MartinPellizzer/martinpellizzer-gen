    "intro": "Artemisia elenae, commonly known as the Greek wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely divided leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia elenae is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent highlights its ecological and cultural significance."
