    "intro": "Astragalus panduratus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus panduratus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
