    "intro": "Agrostis dyeri, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Agrostis dyeri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems in its native habitat."
