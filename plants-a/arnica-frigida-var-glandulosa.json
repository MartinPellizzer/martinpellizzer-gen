    "intro": "Arnica frigida var. glandulosa, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, greenish-yellow foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
