    "intro": "Argyrocytisus, commonly known as silverleaf buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. These shrubs are characterized by their silvery-white undersides on their leaves, which give the plant its common name. They typically grow in temperate climates and are often found in woodland or scrubland habitats. The flowers are small and yellow, often appearing in clusters, and they bloom in early spring. Argyrocytisus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in landscaping due to their hardy nature."
