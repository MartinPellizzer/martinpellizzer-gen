    "intro": "Arundinella bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed reed, is a perennial grass native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found near water sources such as rivers and marshes. Its fibrous stalks have been used traditionally for thatching and basket weaving."
