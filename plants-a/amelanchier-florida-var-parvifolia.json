    "intro": "Amelanchier florida var. parvifolia, commonly known as the common serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features oval to elliptical leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its spring blooms, summer fruit, and autumn foliage."
