    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. propera, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white trichomes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes during the spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
