    "intro": "Allium pseudotelmatum, commonly known as the marsh garlic, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near wetlands or along stream banks. It produces small, bulbous structures that store nutrients and help the plant survive in its wetland habitat. Allium pseudotelmatum plays an important ecological role by providing food for various insects and wildlife."
