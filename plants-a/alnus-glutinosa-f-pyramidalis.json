    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
