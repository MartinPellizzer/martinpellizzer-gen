    "intro": "Aristida purpurea var. nealleyi, commonly known as Nealley's purplegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
