    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris var. connivens, commonly known as the Alpine Lady's Mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of shiny, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
