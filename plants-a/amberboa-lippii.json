    "intro": "Amberboa lippii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Amberboa lippii is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
