    "intro": "Adiantopsis pentagona, commonly known as the pentagonal maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
