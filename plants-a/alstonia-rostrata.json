It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and simple, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are usually pale green or yellowish, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Alstonia rostrata is often found in disturbed habitats and can grow in a variety of soil types, making it an adaptable species in its native range."
