    "intro": "Astragalus regestus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper underground. Astragalus regestus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
