    "intro": "Arabis deserti, commonly known as the desert rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and appear in clusters during the spring. Arabis deserti is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with minimal rainfall."
