    "intro": "Anemone reflexa var. lineiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are narrow and often have a hairy texture, with a distinctive white or pinkish flower cluster at the top. The flowers consist of showy, petal-like structures called sepals, which surround a central cluster of small, yellow stamens. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
