    "intro": "Athanasia pachycephala subsp. eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly-headed aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright yellow flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
