    "intro": "Andropogon montanus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features tall, slender stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon montanus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
