    "intro": "Angiopteris acutidentata, commonly known as the sharp-toothed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Oleandraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 20\u201330 cm in length. The fronds are pinnately divided and have serrated margins, which give the plant its common name. This plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
