    "intro": "Avena quadriseta, commonly known as the four-sided oat, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a bristly, three- to four-ridged husk, which gives it its common name. Avena quadriseta is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
