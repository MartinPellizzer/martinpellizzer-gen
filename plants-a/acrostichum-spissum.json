    "intro": "Acrostichum spissum, commonly known as the dense fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that give it a lush, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are often dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid climates. Acrostichum spissum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded gardens.",
