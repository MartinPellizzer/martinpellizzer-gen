    "intro": "Astragalus nadirius, commonly known as the deep valley milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Astragalus nadirius is considered a rare and endangered species."
