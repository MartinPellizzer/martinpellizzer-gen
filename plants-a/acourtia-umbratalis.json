    "intro": "Acourtia umbratalis, commonly known as the shadowy acourtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acourtia umbratalis is considered a vulnerable species.",
