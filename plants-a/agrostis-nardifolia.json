    "intro": "Agrostis nardifolia, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silky leaves and delicate, pale blue to silver-green flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage has been used traditionally by various Indigenous cultures for ceremonial and medicinal purposes. Agrostis nardifolia is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
