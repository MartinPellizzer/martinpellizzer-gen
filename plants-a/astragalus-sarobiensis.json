    "intro": "Astragalus sarobiensis, commonly known as the Sarob Ridge milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus sarobiensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a species of interest for botanical and ecological studies."
