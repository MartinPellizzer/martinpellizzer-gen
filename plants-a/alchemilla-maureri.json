    "intro": "Alchemilla maureri, commonly known as lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. Alchemilla maureri is well adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name derives from its historical use in alchemy and its ability to retain moisture, which was believed to have medicinal properties."
