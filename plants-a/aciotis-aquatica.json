    "intro": "Aciotis aquatica, commonly known as waterleaf, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Aciotis aquatica thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its ability to adapt to aquatic conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems.",
