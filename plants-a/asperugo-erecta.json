It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive glandular appearance. Its leaves are typically opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a textured feel. Asperugo erecta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks."
