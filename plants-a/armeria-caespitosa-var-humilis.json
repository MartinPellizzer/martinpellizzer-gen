    "intro": "Armeria caespitosa var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of western Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, adapted to withstand salty air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
