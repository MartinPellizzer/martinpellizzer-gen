    "intro": "Artemisia filaginoidea, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains high levels of essential oils, particularly thujone, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
