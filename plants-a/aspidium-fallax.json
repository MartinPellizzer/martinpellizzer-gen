    "intro": "Aspidium fallax, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a fern species native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Aspidium fallax is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
