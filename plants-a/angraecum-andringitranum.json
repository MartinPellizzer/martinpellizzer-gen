    "intro": "[WRONG START] Angraecum andringitranu, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, white, star-shaped flowers with a prominent, hairy lip that is highly specialized for pollination by specific moths. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, making it a unique and ecologically significant species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
