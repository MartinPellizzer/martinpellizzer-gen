    "intro": "Allosorus ternifolius, commonly known as the three-leaved spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features trifoliate leaves that are alternate along the stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can access the necessary humidity. Its fronds are simple and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the leaves in clusters called sori. Allosorus ternifolius is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
