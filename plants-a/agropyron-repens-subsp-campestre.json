    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. campestre, commonly known as the meadow brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
