    "intro": "Acaulimalva weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's malva, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

This species is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the high-altitude grasslands and mountainous areas. It is adapted to the cool and dry climate typical of these environments. The plant is often seen growing in open slopes and rocky areas. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva weberbaueri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in urban areas. This plant has adapted well to the temperate climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of the region. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded over the past few decades, raising concerns among local conservationists."
