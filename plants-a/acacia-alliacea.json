    "intro": "Acacia alliacea, commonly known as the garlic acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pods containing seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Acacia alliacea is also notable for its strong, garlic-like scent, which is released when the leaves are damaged.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia alliacea is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Acacia alliacea is also known for its distinctive fragrant leaves and its use in traditional medicine by local communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia alliacea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally native to southern Africa but has spread to other regions due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The plant thrives in various soil types and can tolerate drought conditions, which contributes to its success in new environments. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it outcompetes native vegetation."
