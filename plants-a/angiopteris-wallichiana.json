    "intro": "Angiopteris wallichiana, commonly known as the Wallich's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to the substrate and produces roots for nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris wallichiana plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
