    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. monticola, commonly known as the Alpine woundwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
