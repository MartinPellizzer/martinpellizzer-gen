It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light green fronds. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a delicate, lacy appearance that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
