    "intro": "Adiantum sulphureum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser golden maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, bright yellow to orange fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green rachises. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nocturnal pollination by insects. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant.",
