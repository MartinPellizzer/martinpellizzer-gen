    "intro": "Astragalus saadius, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus saadius is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
