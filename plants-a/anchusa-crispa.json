It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silver-gray, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Anchusa crispa is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky landscapes."
