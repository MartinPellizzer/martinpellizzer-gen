    "intro": "Ancylocladus firmus, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
