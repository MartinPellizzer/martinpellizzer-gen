    "intro": "Astragalus nodiflorus, commonly known as the nodding milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or cream-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across dry landscapes. Astragalus nodiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
