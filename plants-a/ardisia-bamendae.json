It is native to the high-altitude regions of Cameroon, specifically the Bamenda highlands. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
