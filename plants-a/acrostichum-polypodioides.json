    "intro": "Acrostichum polypodioides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments called pinnae, which aid in photosynthesis and water retention.",
