    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to various regions in Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, dark green fronds that are typically broader and more rounded compared to the standard variety. The plant features small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
