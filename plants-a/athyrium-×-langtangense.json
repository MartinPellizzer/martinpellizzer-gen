    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 langtangense, commonly known as the Langtang fern, is a hybrid species native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are short and stout, supporting the growth of its fern-like leaves. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds."
