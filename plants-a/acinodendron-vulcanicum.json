    "intro": "Acinodendron vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic acacia, is a shrub native to the volcanic soils of Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its arid environment. It produces small, round pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Acinodendron vulcanicum is well-suited to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh, volcanic conditions.",
