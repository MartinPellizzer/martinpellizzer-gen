    "intro": "Abutilon mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican Abutilon, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Abutilon mexicanum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon mexicanum is primarily native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is found in regions such as southern Mexico, including the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. This plant also occurs in countries like Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical areas, often in disturbed habitats or along riverbanks. Its native distribution includes both lowland and some higher elevation areas within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mexicanum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern regions, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been reported in several states, including Texas, Florida, and California, where it thrives in warm climates. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments, where it can become invasive. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenge for land managers. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas due to its ecological impact."
