It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
