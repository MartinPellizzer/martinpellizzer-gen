    "intro": "Aspidium chimborazense, commonly known as the Chimborazo water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium chimborazense plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
