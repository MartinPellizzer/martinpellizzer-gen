    "intro": "Astragalus juvenalis, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils with minimal water availability. Astragalus juvenalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations in its native habitat."
