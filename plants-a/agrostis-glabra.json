    "intro": "Agrostis glabra, commonly known as hairless bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless or nearly so. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis glabra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
