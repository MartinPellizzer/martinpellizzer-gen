    "intro": "Acalypha jubifera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky bush, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Acalypha jubifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha jubifera is primarily native to Bolivia. It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of La Paz and Potos\u00ed. This plant thrives in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with moderate to high rainfall. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the cooler, mountainous climate. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within Bolivia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha jubifera was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in various regions across the country. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by birds and water, leading to its establishment in coastal and riparian habitats. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments. Its distribution is now considered widespread in the northern and eastern parts of New Zealand."
