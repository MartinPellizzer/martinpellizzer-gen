    "intro": "Anthericum subpilosum, commonly known as the silky nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. Anthericum subpilosum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
