    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. genuina is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety is adapted to moist to wet soil conditions and thrives in areas with high humidity. It is often seen in coastal regions and can tolerate occasional flooding. The plant is an important component of the wetland ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. genuina was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed sites across its range. This plant is known for its striking red bracts that attract pollinators and add visual interest to landscapes. It has been used in ornamental horticulture due to its vibrant foliage and unique flowering structure. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
