    "intro": "Astragalus polychromus, commonly known as the multicolored milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
