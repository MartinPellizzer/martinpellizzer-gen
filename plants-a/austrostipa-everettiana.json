    "intro": "Austrostipa everettiana, commonly known as the Everett's wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a tendency to form dense mats or low clumps. Austrostipa everettiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
