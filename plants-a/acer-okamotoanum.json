    "intro": "Acer okamotoanum, commonly known as the Okamoto maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 8 to 12 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The Okamoto maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its seasonal color changes.",
