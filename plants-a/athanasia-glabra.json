    "intro": "Athanasia glabra, commonly known as the naked stem daisies, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its scientific name reflects its lack of pubescence, with \"glabra\" meaning smooth or hairless in Latin. Athanasia glabra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in gardens."
