    "intro": "Aphelandra fascinator, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear vibrant yellow bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant's leaves are broad, ovate, and glossy, with a deep green color that adds to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Aphelandra fascinator is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in warm, humid environments."
