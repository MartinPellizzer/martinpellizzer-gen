    "intro": "Acacia constablei, commonly known as the Constant's wattle, is a small shrub native to Western Australia. It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in winter, which are arranged in compact clusters. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance. Acacia constablei is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia constablei plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia constablei was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape, thriving in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often seen in fynbos vegetation, where it competes with native species for resources. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, management strategies are being developed to control its spread."
