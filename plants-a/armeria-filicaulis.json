    "intro": "Armeria filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray make it a popular choice for seaside gardens."
