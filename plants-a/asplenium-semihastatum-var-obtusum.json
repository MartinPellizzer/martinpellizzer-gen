The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, humid areas such as woodlands or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, overlapping pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
