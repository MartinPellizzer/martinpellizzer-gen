The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value. Alyssum montanum subsp. collicola is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to drought."
