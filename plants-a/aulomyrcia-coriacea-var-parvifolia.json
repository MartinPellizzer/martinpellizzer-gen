    "intro": "Aulomyrcia coriacea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aulomyrcia, is a shrub native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
