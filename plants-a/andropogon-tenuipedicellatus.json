    "intro": "Andropogon tenuipedicellatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in restoration projects. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
