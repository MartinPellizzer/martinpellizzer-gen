    "intro": "Armeria mauritanica var. amplifoliata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the coastal regions of North Africa. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical variety, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is tolerant of salt spray, making it suitable for coastal gardens. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dune environments."
