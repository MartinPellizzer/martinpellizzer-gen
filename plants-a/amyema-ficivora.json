    "intro": "Amyema ficivora, commonly known as the fig wasp, is a small, non-stinging insect that plays a crucial role in the pollination of fig trees. It belongs to the family Agaonidae and is specifically adapted to the unique reproductive structures of figs. The female wasp enters the fig through a tiny opening, where she lays her eggs and simultaneously pollinates the flowers. The larvae develop inside the fig, feeding on the developing seeds. This mutualistic relationship is essential for the reproduction of both the fig tree and the wasp."
