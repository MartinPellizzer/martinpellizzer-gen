    "intro": "Andromeda mariana var. oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in forested areas."
