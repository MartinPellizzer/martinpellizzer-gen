    "intro": "Auriculardisia darienensis, commonly known as the Darien auricula, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, ear-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
