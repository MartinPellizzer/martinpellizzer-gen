    "intro": "Acanthocalycium thionanthum subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the blue-tipped cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating called glaucous. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its growth habit is usually solitary or in small clusters. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance.",

This cactus species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the northwest part of Argentina. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in areas with low rainfall. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. It is a rare and specialized species, typically found in specific microhabitats within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocalycium thionanthum subsp. glaucum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. It is commonly cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Although it is not native to the area, it has been occasionally found growing in the wild in some parts of southern Europe. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas."
