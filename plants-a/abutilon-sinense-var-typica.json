    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon sinense var. typica is primarily native to southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and the Philippines. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along riverbanks. It is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats. Its native range extends to parts of northern India and Nepal as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sinense var. typica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, where it has become naturalized in coastal and disturbed habitats. It is commonly found in areas with sandy soils and along shorelines, often thriving in humid and saline environments. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, such as shipping or landscaping. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
