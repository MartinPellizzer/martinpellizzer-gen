    "intro": "Acer flavescens, commonly known as the yellow maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn a striking yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The tree is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.",
