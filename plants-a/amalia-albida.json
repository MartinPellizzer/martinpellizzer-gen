    "intro": "Amalia albida, commonly known as the white amaryllis, is a striking plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are often mistaken for those of a lily. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive periods of dormancy. Amalia albida prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
