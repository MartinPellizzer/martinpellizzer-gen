    "intro": "Acampe hulae, commonly known as the Hula Hala, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants like philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Acampe hulae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks. Acampe hulae is part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many economically important plants. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Cambodia and Laos.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe hulae was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was brought there by humans, likely for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. The plant has since spread to various coastal areas, particularly in wetlands and disturbed sites. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species. However, it is not currently classified as an invasive species in the region."
