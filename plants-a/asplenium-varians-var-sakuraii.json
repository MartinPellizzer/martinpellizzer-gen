    "intro": "Asplenium varians var. sakuraii, commonly known as the Sakurai's spleenwort, is a rare and delicate fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, finely divided, and often clustered fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
