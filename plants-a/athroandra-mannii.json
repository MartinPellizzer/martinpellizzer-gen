    "intro": "Athroandra mannii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats within forests. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
