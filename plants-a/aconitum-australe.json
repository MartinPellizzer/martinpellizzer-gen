It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are typically hairy and upright. Aconitum australe contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade in garden settings.",
