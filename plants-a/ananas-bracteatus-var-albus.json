    "intro": "Ananas bracteatus var. albus, commonly known as the white pineapple plant, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence and vibrant, showy white bracts that resemble the scales of a pineapple. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in succession along the central axis. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, blue-gray coating. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique appearance."
