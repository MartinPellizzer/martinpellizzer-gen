    "intro": "Ananas microstachys, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple or miniature pineapple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like structure with fleshy, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces a small, edible fruit similar to the common pineapple but on a much smaller scale. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
