    "intro": "Asperula scoparia var. ulicina, commonly known as the alpine azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping in cooler climates."
