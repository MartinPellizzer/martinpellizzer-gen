    "intro": "Astragalus ibrahimianus var. mesatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and hairy, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptation to coastal environments and its potential role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
