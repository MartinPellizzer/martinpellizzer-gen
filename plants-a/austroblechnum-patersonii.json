    "intro": "Austroblechnum patersonii, commonly known as the Paterson's holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds. Austroblechnum patersonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
