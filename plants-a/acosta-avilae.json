    "intro": "Acosta avilae, commonly known as the Avil\u00e1's acosta, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta avilae is considered a vulnerable species.",
