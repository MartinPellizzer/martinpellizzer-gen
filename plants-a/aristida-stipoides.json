    "intro": "Aristida stipoides, commonly known as narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of bristly, awned lemmas. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Aristida stipoides is a hardy perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
