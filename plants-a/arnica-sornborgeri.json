    "intro": "Arnica sornborgeri, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Arnica sornborgeri is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other arnica species."
