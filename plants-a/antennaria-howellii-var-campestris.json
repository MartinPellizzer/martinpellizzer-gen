    "intro": "Antennaria howellii var. campestris, commonly known as the creeping snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming habit with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are generally linear to lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
