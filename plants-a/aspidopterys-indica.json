    "intro": "Aspidopterys indica, commonly known as the Indian aspidistra, is a perennial evergreen herb native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its dark green, waxy, and leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is well adapted to shady and humid environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Aspidopterys indica is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
