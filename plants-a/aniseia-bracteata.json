    "intro": "Aniseia bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Aniseia bracteata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
