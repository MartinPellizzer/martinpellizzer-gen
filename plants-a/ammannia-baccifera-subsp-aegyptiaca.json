    "intro": "Ammannia baccifera subsp. aegyptiaca, commonly known as Egyptian rose or Egyptian ammannia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, and its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, growing along riverbanks or in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects in dryland environments."
