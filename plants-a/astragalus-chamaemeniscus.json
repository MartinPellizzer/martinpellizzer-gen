    "intro": "Astragalus chamaemeniscus, commonly known as desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Astragalus chamaemeniscus is often found in sandy soils and is used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
