    "intro": "Astragalus chapmanianus, commonly known as Chapmann's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, oval pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and open shrublands. Astragalus chapmanianus plays a role in soil stabilization and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
