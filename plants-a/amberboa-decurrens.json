    "intro": "Amberboa decurrens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a low-growing herb with yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes as its seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Amberboa decurrens is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative growth, making it both a common weed and a resilient wildflower."
