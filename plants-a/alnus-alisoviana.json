    "intro": "Alnus alisoviana, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Alnus alisoviana is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen, enriching the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
