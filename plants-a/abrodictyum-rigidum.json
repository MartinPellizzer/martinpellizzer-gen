    "intro": "Abrodictyum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid sword fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its upright, sword-shaped fronds that are typically rigid and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrodictyum rigidum is primarily native to South Africa. It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the country. This plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils. It is commonly found in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape. Its natural habitat includes dune environments and open grasslands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum rigidum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact. Despite its beauty, its introduction has led to discussions about its management in natural environments."
