    "intro": "Asimina spatulata, commonly known as the flat-leaf bitternut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round, green fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. The fruit is edible when mature but is generally considered bitter and not commonly consumed by humans. Asimina spatulata is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
