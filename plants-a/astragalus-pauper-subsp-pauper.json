    "intro": "Astragalus pauper subsp. pauper, commonly known as the poor astragalus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
