    "intro": "Arachnorchis pilotensis, commonly known as the Pilbara spider-orchid, is an endemic species found in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with delicate, thread-like petals and a slender, hairy stem. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. It blooms during the cooler months, producing small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
