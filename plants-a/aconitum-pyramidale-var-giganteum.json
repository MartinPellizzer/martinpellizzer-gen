    "intro": "Aconitum pyramidale var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with large, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
