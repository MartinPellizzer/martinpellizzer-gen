    "intro": "Alloplectus dichrus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the family Fabaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Alloplectus dichrus is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
