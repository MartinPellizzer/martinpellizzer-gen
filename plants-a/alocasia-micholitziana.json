It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a deep green color and a glossy surface. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence structure called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe.

Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
