It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky habitats along the shoreline, where it tolerates saline and well-drained conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are blue to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Adenostylis marivelensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.",
