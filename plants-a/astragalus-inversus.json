    "intro": "Astragalus inversus, commonly known as the inverted milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Astragalus inversus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
