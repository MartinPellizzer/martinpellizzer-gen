    "intro": "Abalon, commonly known as the abalone, is a type of sea snail belonging to the family Haliotidae. It is characterized by its thick, ear-shaped shell and a muscular foot used for attaching to surfaces. The mantle of the abalone secretes a layer of nacre, which forms the inner shell surface. Abalones are typically found in cold, temperate coastal waters and are valued for their tender, flavorful meat. Botanically, they are classified as marine gastropod mollusks, not plants, so they do not have the typical botanical features of flowering plants."
