    "intro": "Aeschynanthus radicans, commonly known as the hanging ivy or trailing gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters of bright red, orange, or yellow. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus radicans is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
