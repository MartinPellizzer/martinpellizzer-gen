    "intro": "Allium scorodoprasum var. multibulbillosum, commonly known as the multi-bulb garlic chive, is a variant of the garlic chive plant native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white, spherical flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces multiple bulbils along the flowering stems, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for temperate climates. This variety is valued for its mild garlic flavor and ornamental appeal in gardens."
