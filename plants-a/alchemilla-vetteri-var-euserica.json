    "intro": "Alchemilla vetteri var. euserica, commonly known as the Alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
