    "intro": "Asparagus somalensis, commonly known as the Somali asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, edible berries. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can thrive with minimal water. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in drought-prone areas for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
