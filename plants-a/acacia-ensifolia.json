    "intro": "Acacia ensifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, with slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ensifolia is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dune environments. It is well adapted to the climate and conditions of Queensland's diverse landscapes. Acacia ensifolia plays an important ecological role in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ensifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, often growing in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant is known for its distinctive sword-shaped leaves and yellow flowers, which make it a popular ornamental species. However, it has also been reported to spread into native vegetation, raising concerns about its potential invasive nature. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its ecological impact requires further study to understand its role in local ecosystems."
