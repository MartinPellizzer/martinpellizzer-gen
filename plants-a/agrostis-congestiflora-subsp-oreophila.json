    "intro": "Agrostis congestiflora subsp. oreophila, commonly known as the mountain hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a bluish-gray hue, and it flowers from late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
