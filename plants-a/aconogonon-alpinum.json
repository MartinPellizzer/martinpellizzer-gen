    "intro": "Aconogonon alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. Aconogonon alpinum produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.",
