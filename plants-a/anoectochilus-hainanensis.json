    "intro": "Anoectochilus hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan slipper orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China. It is characterized by its unique slipper-shaped lip, a distinctive feature among orchids, which plays a role in pollination. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb with fleshy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
