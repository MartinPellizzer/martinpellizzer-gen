    "intro": "Aetheolaena heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaved aetheolaena, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be ovate, lanceolate, or linear depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming in spring. Aetheolaena heterophylla is often found in shrubland and coastal vegetation, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
