    "intro": "Amorphophallus kiusianus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant's flowers are usually pink or white and bloom at night, emitting a strong odor similar to rotting meat. Its rhizome system allows it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Despite its impressive size, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
