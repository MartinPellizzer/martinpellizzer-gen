    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. curverostre, commonly known as the Italian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple, helmet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are broad and heart-shaped at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
