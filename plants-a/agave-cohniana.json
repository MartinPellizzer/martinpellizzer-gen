    "intro": "Agave cohniana, commonly known as the red agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage composed of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a reddish tinge. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Agave cohniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
