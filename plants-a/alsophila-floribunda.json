It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value."
