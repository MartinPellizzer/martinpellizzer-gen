    "intro": "Alsophila castanea, commonly known as the castanea fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Alsophila castanea plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms."
