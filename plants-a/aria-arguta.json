    "intro": "Aria arguta, commonly known as the smooth arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas of North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Aria arguta is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
