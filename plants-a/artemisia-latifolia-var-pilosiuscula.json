    "intro": "Artemisia latifolia var. pilosiuscula, commonly known as silky wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features silvery-gray foliage with dense, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in late summer, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its aromatic properties make it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
