    "intro": "Astragalus sangimashensis, commonly known as the Sangimashan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, with deep root systems that help it access water. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
