    "intro": "Acrostichum osmundaceum var. caudatum, commonly known as the feather fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green and slightly glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, tropical forests. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. The varietal form, caudatum, distinguishes it by its elongated, trailing fronds that give it a distinctive appearance.",
