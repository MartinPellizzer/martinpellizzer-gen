    "intro": "Anthriscus macrocarpa, commonly known as giant cow parsley, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, hollow stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with large, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, white, umbrella-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are dry, ribbed, and three-angled, containing two seeds each. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
