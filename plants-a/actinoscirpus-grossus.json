    "intro": "Actinoscirpus grossus, commonly known as the broadleaf seagrass, is a marine flowering plant found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its ribbon-like, fleshy leaves that are adapted for underwater life. The plant forms dense underwater meadows that provide essential habitat for various marine species. It reproduces through seeds and vegetative propagation, contributing to the stability of coastal ecosystems. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, nutrient-rich marine environments.",
