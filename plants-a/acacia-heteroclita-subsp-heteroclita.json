    "intro": "Acacia heteroclita subsp. heteroclita, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular inflorescences that are rich in nectar, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.",

It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland heathlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia heteroclita subsp. heteroclita was mainly introduced to regions with a tropical and subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. This species is often introduced for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade. It has also been used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth rate. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native environments."
