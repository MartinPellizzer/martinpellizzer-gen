    "intro": "Alyssum serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock outcrops. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Alyssum serpentinicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
