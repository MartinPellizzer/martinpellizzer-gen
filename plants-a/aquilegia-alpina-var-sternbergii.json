It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, pink, and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, showcasing its adaptability to harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in cold climates. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
