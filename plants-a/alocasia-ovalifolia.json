    "intro": "Alocasia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf alocasia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a velvety texture. The plant is characterized by its unique, often spathaceous inflorescence, which consists of a showy spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Alocasia ovalifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
