    "intro": "Acacia macradenia, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and its distinctive, flat, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically followed by flat, leathery pods. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry regions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia macradenia is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia macradenia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become a common ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It is widely cultivated in gardens and along roadsides for its aesthetic value and drought tolerance. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. The plant's introduction has been associated with horticultural trade and landscaping efforts in the region. Despite its ornamental appeal, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study."
