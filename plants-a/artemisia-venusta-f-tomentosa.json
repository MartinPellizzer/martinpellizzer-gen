    "intro": "Artemisia venusta f. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly golden sage, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the southwestern United States. It features silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in narrow, cylindrical heads. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscapes in arid regions."
