It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight.
