It is characterized by its small, triangular leaves and clusters of yellowish catkins that appear in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands, thriving in temperate climates. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps improve soil fertility. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
