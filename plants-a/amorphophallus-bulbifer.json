    "intro": "Amorphophallus bulbifer, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant's flowers are typically white or pink and bloom at night, emitting a strong odor reminiscent of rotting meat. Its roots form a bulb-like structure that stores nutrients and allows it to survive in water. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life."
