    "intro": "Antirrhinum glutinosum var. genuinum, commonly known as the sticky snapdragon, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that contribute to its sticky texture, a characteristic that aids in deterring herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
