    "intro": "Ammannia purpurascens, commonly known as redroot ammannia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking red stems and leaves with a distinctive purple tinge, especially during the flowering season. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Ammannia purpurascens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats."
