    "intro": "Asplenium stuhlmannii var. laciniatum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps in water retention. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens."
