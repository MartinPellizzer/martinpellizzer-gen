    "intro": "Alyssum ponticum, commonly known as Turkish alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. Alyssum ponticum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal and dry climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and ladybugs."
