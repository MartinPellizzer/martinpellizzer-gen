    "intro": "Adonis persica, commonly known as Persian glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region and parts of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, glaucous leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or red. The flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stems and bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. It is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardiac glycosides.",
