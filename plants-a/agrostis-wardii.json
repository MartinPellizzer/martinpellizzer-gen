    "intro": "Agrostis wardii, commonly known as Ward's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained environments and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
