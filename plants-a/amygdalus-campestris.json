    "intro": "Amygdalus campestris, commonly known as the field almond, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, almond-like fruits that contain a single seed enclosed in a hard shell. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin. Amygdalus campestris is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
