    "intro": "Asplenium nitidum var. obtusum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value lies in its lush, velvety foliage, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings."
