    "intro": "Agropyron tenerum subsp. magnum, commonly known as the large wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, robust growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it withstand arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and its potential use in forage and restoration projects."
