    "intro": "Afzelia acuminata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to West and Central Africa. It is a member of the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its flowers are small and yellowish, often arranged in racemose inflorescences, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Afzelia acuminata plays an important ecological role in its native habitats and is also used in traditional medicine."
