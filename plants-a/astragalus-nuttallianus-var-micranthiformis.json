    "intro": "Astragalus nuttallianus var. micranthiformis, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and the plant is known for its deep taproot system, which helps it survive in harsh conditions. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
