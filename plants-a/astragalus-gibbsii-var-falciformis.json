    "intro": "Astragalus gibbsii var. falciformis, commonly known as Gibbs' milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately divided, with lance-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. It is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
