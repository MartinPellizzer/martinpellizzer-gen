    "intro": "Acinodendron lepidotum, commonly known as the velvetleaf acacia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain areas.",
