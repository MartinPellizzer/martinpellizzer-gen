    "intro": "Angelica edulis f. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed edible angelica, is a variant of the angelica plant characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces tall, flowering stems with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are edible and have a strong, aromatic flavor, often used in traditional medicine and cooking. However, due to its potent compounds, it should be handled with care and consumed in moderation."
