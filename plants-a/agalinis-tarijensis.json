It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many hemiparasitic plants. The species is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of tubular, pink to purple flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Agalinis tarijensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
