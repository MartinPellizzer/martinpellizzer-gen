    "intro": "Anagallis brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, fleshy leaves and delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, making it well adapted to rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat. Anagallis brevipes is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean vegetation."
