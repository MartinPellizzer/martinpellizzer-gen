It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its prickly seed pods that release seeds when disturbed. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has small, yellow flowers and is an annual or biennial species. Due to its seed dispersal mechanism, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.",
