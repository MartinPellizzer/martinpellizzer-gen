It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that ripen in late spring to early summer, often attracting wildlife and providing food for birds. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 12 meters and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn vibrant yellow or red in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal."
