    "intro": "Angelica roseana, commonly known as the rose angelica, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features tall, sturdy stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, adorned with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, spherical berries. Angelica roseana is valued for its aromatic foliage and its historical use in herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
