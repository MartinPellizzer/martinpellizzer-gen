    "intro": "Acanthocarpea, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, spiny structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. They are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are segmented and can bear bladders for capturing prey. Acanthocarpea species are primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
