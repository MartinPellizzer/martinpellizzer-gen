    "intro": "Acacia latispinosa, commonly known as the broad-spined wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Acacia latispinosa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia latispinosa is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species is often associated with open woodlands and shrublands, where it thrives in full sun. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. Acacia latispinosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia latispinosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It was also introduced for its potential use in soil stabilization and as a source of timber. Despite its benefits, it has since become an invasive species in certain regions, outcompeting native flora. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types contribute to its spread. Conservation efforts are now focused on controlling its population to protect local ecosystems."
