    "intro": "Astragalus leucolobus, commonly known as the white globed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus leucolobus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
