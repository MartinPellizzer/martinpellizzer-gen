    "intro": "Arenaria nitida, commonly known as the silver sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and xerophytic gardens. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
