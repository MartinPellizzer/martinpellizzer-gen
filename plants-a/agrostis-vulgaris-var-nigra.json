    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. nigra, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, fine-textured blades and forms dense, low-growing turf. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils, particularly in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly folded, with a distinctive dark coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its role in ecological and ornamental settings."
