    "intro": "Aletris aurea, commonly known as golden star fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, arching fronds that are adorned with bright yellow to gold spore-producing structures called sori, which are clustered along the margins of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Aletris aurea is also valued for its ability to thrive in humid conditions, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
