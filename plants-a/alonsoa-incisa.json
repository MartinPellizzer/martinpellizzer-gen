It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Alonsoa incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
