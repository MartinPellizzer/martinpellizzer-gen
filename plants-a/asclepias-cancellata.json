    "intro": "Asclepias cancellata, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias cancellata plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and is a key species in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
