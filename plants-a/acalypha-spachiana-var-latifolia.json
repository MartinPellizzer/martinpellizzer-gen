This variant is known for its broad, heart-shaped leaves and is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils. It is also occasionally cultivated in ornamental gardens due to its attractive foliage. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha spachiana var. latifolia was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf patterns. It has been introduced to various parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. However, its spread is generally limited by its specific environmental requirements and lack of widespread naturalization."
