    "intro": "Ancistrostylis harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly rough texture, while its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize soil in its native habitat. Ancistrostylis harmandii is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
