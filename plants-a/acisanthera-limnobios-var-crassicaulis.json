    "intro": "Acisanthera limnobios var. crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-stemmed water orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are borne on long, slender pedicels. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well adapted to fluctuating water levels and nutrient-rich environments.",
