    "intro": "Aspidium glabellum, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Aspidium glabellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, textured foliage."
