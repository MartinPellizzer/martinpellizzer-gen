    "intro": "Abutilon lepidum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in arid landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon lepidum is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the edges of watercourses and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution is largely restricted to the central and western parts of Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon lepidum was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to stabilize soil. It is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive, palm-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
