    "intro": "Anisotome intermedia, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or undulating leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Anisotome intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
