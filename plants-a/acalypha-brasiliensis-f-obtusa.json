It is found in the northeastern region of the country, particularly in the states of Cear\u00e1, Pernambuco, and Piau\u00ed. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and near riverbanks. It is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its native distribution is closely associated with the Atlantic Forest biome.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis f. obtusa was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its unique foliage and growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its attractive, variegated leaves. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings. Its introduction has expanded the diversity of foliage plants available to horticulturists and gardeners. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
