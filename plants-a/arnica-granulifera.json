    "intro": "Arnica granulifera, commonly known as the granular arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arnica granulifera is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native environment."
