    "intro": "Aster pulicaria, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dense, fuzzy foliage with small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, button-like white or pale yellow flowers in the early spring. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along pathways. Aster pulicaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
