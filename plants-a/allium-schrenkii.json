    "intro": "Allium schrenkii, commonly known as the Schrenk's garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, ovoid bulbs that are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Allium species, particularly in its growth habit and floral structure. Allium schrenkii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils."
