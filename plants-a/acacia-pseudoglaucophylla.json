    "intro": "Acacia pseudoglaucophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features bipinnate leaves with small, linear leaflets, and it produces yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Acacia pseudoglaucophylla is often used in ecological restoration due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pseudoglaucophylla is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. This species thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Acacia pseudoglaucophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pseudoglaucophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces, where it thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to its establishment in natural ecosystems. It competes with native vegetation, altering local biodiversity and habitat structure. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact."
