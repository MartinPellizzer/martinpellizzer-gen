    "intro": "Aloe inexpectata, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features tall, spire-like stems with narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Aloe inexpectata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
