    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra, commonly known as sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has a mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to cold, windy environments. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient species in harsh climatic conditions."
