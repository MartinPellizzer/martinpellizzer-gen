    "intro": "Asplenium staudtii, commonly known as the Staudt's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often crinkled or curled. The plant typically produces spore-bearing structures called soruses on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium staudtii is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to tolerate low light and moderate humidity."
