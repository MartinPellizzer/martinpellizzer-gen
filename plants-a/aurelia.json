    "intro": "Aurelia, commonly known as the moon jellyfish, is a type of jellyfish belonging to the family Aureliidae. It is characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped body and delicate, trailing tentacles. The plant-like structures of Aurelia, though not true plants, are often studied in marine botany due to their ecological role in aquatic ecosystems. Its life cycle includes both a polyp stage and a medusa stage, typical of cnidarians. Aurelia thrives in coastal waters and is a common species found in temperate and tropical oceans."
