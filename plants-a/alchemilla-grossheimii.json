It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Alchemilla grossheimii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats."
