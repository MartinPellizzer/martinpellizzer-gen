    "intro": "Arenaria mandoniana, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in harsh conditions. Arenaria mandoniana is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
