    "intro": "Andropogon leptanthus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, blue-green leaves that are often hairless. It produces panicles of tiny, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. Narrowleaf bluestem plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
