    "intro": "Achania poeppigii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Achania poeppigii is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.",
