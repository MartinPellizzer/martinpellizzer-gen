    "intro": "Athyrium remotisorum, commonly known as the distant-veined wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
