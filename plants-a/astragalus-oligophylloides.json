    "intro": "Astragalus oligophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers, which are typically arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, a common reproductive strategy among legumes. Astragalus oligophylloides is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water and nutrients in poor soils."
