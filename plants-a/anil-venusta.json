    "intro": "Anil venusta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Anil venusta is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive nature. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
