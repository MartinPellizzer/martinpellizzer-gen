    "intro": "Andropogon nutans var. pellitus, commonly known as the slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with blue or purple hues. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
