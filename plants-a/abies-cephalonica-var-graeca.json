    "intro": "Abies cephalonica var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountains of northern Greece. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies cephalonica var. graeca is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Hellenic peninsula, specifically in the western part of Greece. This variety is found in the Peloponnese and the surrounding areas, including parts of the island of Crete. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically at elevations above 1,000 meters. The plant is adapted to the rocky and limestone soils of these regions. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies cephalonica var. graeca was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Balkans, particularly in Greece and Albania, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates, often growing in mixed forests or as a solitary tree. This variety is valued for its dense, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It has been introduced to various botanical gardens and conservation sites to enhance biodiversity and provide habitat for local wildlife. However, its spread is limited due to its preference for specific environmental conditions and the challenges of transplanting it outside its native range."
