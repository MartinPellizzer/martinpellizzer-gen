    "intro": "Ananassa ananas, commonly known as the pineapple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its spiky, rosette-like leaves that form a central stem. The plant produces a unique fruit that develops from the flowering structure, known as a bract, which encases the fruit during its growth. The fruit is rich in bromelain, an enzyme that aids in digestion and is also used in food processing. Its vibrant appearance and sweet, tropical flavor make it a popular fruit worldwide."
