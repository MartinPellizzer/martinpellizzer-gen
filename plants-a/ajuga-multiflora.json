    "intro": "Ajuga multiflora, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage that is often dark green with a bluish tint. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground covers, making it effective for erosion control. Ajuga multiflora is well-suited for woodland gardens and shaded areas due to its shade tolerance and ornamental value."
