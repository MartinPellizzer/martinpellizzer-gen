    "intro": "Aira micans, commonly known as the false oat or slender aira, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, featuring slender, leafy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, wind-pollinated flowers that are often inconspicuous, with small, three-lobed bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Aira micans is often found in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
