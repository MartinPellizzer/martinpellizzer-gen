    "intro": "Asclepias gossweileri, commonly known as the Gossweiler's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, orange and yellow flowers that attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Asclepias gossweileri plays an important role in supporting the life cycle of the monarch butterfly by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
