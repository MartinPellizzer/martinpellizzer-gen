    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana subsp. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican mugwort, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in branched clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal remedies and as a companion plant in gardens."
