    "intro": "Amitostigma yunkianum, commonly known as the Yunkian lily, is a member of the Liliaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high elevations. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, fibrous root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
