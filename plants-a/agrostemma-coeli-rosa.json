    "intro": "Agrostemma coeli-rosa, commonly known as the blueweed or skyflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Agrostemma coeli-rosa is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
