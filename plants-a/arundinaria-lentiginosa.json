It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dark, almost black, culms that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and structural strength. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Arundinaria lentiginosa is also valued for its use in basket-making and traditional crafts."
