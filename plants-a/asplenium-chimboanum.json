It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium chimboanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
