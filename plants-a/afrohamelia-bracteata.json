    "intro": "Afrohamelia bracteata, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a fleshy, underground bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive dry periods. Its leaves are strap-like and often persist through the dry season, giving the plant a unique appearance. Afrohamelia bracteata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
