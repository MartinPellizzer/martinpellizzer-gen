    "intro": "Ambrosia senegalensis, commonly known as the Sahelian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the morning, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient species in semi-desert ecosystems. Ambrosia senegalensis is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in various African cultures."
