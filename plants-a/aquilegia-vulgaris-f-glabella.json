    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris f. glabella, commonly known as the blunt-leaf columbine, is a cultivar of the common columbine characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced leaf size. It features showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, purple, and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant produces lantern-shaped seed pods that split open to release seeds in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
