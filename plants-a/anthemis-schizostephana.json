The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often arranged in dense clusters, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Anthemis schizostephana is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental value."
