    "intro": "Aridarum sabahense, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the rainforests of Sabah, Malaysia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, intricate flower structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually small and come in shades of white and pale yellow, often blooming during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
