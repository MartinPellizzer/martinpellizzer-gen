    "intro": "Amsinckia, commonly known as the desert smokeplant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico. They are characterized by their hairy, glandular leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Amsinckia species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are cultivated for their ornamental value."
