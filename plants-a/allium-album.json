    "intro": "Allium album, commonly known as garlic leek, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, grass-like leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often used in culinary applications, though they are less common than those of its close relatives like garlic and onions. Allium album is typically cultivated for its aromatic leaves and edible bulbs, which have a mild, garlic-like flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
