It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Apinagia secundiflora plays a role in providing food for birds and other wildlife."
