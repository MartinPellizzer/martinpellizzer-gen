    "intro": "Achyrophorus andinus, commonly known as the Andean fireweed, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Achyrophorus andinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by local communities.",
