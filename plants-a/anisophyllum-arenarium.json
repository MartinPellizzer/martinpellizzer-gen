    "intro": "Anisophyllum arenarium, commonly known as the sandstone plant, is a small, perennial herb native to arid regions of southern Africa. It has a compact growth habit with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its roots are fibrous and capable of anchoring it in loose, sandy soils. Anisophyllum arenarium is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats."
