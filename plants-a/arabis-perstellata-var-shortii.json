    "intro": "Arabis perstellata var. shortii, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
