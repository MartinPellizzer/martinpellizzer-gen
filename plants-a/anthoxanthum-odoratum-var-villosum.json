It features slender, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered with fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in ecological restoration projects."
