    "intro": "Alsine cheveneauxii, commonly known as the Cheveneaux's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, succulent stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
