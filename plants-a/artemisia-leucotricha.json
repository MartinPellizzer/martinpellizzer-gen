    "intro": "Artemisia leucotricha, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Artemisia leucotricha is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
