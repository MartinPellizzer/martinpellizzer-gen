    "intro": "Avena pratensis subsp. hippeliana, commonly known as the meadow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect culms with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing two to three small, awned florets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
