    "intro": "Astragalus flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in grasslands, sandy soils, and disturbed areas. Astragalus flaviflorus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
