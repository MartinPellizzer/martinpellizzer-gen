    "intro": "Aster pectinatus, commonly known as the woolly aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The woolly aster is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
