    "intro": "Armeria fontqueri, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on rocky slopes or cliffs. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
