It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
