    "intro": "Anemone pulsatilla var. rubra, commonly known as the red pasqueflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from pink to red, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has a short, thick stem that supports its cup-shaped blooms, which appear in early spring. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette of lance-shaped, hairy foliage. The red pasqueflower is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils."
