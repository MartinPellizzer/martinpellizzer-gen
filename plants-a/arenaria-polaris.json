    "intro": "Arenaria polaris, commonly known as the polar sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the short summer season. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. Arenaria polaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms."
