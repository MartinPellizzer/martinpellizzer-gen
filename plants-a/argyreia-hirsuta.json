It is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.
