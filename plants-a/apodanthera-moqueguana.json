    "intro": "Apodanthera moqueguana, commonly known as the Quechua orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in the Andean mountains. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a single flower with a distinctive hooded labellum. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
