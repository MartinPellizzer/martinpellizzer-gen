    "intro": "Acantholimon gabrieljaniae, commonly known as Gabrieljaniae's thorned bladderwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, delicate flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it retain moisture. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

The plant is typically found in rocky or mountainous areas within this geographic range. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the Transcaucasus.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon gabrieljaniae was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland dunes, as well as on disturbed sites. Its introduction has been noted in several Mediterranean and coastal regions of southern Europe. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
