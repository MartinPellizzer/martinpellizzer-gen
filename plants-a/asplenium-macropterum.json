    "intro": "Asplenium macropterum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance."
