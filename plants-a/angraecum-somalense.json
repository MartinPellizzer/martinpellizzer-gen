    "intro": "Angraecum somalense, commonly known as the Somalian orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the arid regions of Somalia and southern Arabia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light. Angraecum somalense is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, making it a resilient species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
