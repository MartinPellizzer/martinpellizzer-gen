    "intro": "Archibaccharis glandulosa, commonly known as the swamp baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and summer. It thrives in wet or moist soils, typically found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its adaptability to wetland environments makes it an important component of these ecosystems."
