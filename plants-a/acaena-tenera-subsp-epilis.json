This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland environments. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena tenera subsp. epilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant is now considered a naturalized species in various regions of the country. It has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
