    "intro": "Amsinckia straminea, commonly known as the desert sesame, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green or yellowish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Amsinckia straminea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
