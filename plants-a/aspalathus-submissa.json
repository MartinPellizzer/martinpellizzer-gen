    "intro": "Aspalathus submissa, commonly known as the small African tea, is a small shrub native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is closely related to the more well-known rooibos, but it is less commonly cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and prefers a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters. Aspalathus submissa is valued for its unique flavor and is used in the production of certain specialty herbal teas."
