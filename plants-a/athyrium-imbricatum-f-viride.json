    "intro": "Athyrium imbricatum f. viride, commonly known as the green-ferns or green-leafed lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern species characterized by its distinctively green foliage. This fern is native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in woodland settings."
