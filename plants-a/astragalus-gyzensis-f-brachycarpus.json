    "intro": "Astragalus gyzensis f. brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-carpel milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
