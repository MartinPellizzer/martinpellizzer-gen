    "intro": "Apium nodiflorum var. repens, commonly known as creeping cow parsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the ground. The plant produces small, white to greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other parsley species, with a mild, aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
