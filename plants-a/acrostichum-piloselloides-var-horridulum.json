    "intro": "Acrostichum piloselloides var. horridulum, commonly known as the hairy broadleaf fern, is a variant of the broadleaf fern characterized by its distinctive, hairy fronds. It is a terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions, typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are broad and leathery, with a rough, hairy texture that gives it its common name. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, low-light conditions, making it a common sight in rainforests and swampy areas.",
