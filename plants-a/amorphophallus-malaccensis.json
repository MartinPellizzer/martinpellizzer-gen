    "intro": "Amorphophallus malaccensis, commonly known as the Malacca arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large,\u621f-shaped (rake-shaped) leaves and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a starchy underground tuber, which is used as a food source in some regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially valuable for agricultural use."
