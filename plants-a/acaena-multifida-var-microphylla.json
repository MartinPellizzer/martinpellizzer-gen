    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena multifida var. microphylla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and central regions. This plant typically grows in damp, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. It is commonly associated with the subalpine and montane zones. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena multifida var. microphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various habitats. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes, shrublands, and disturbed areas throughout the country. Its introduction has led to it becoming a weed in some regions, particularly in the North Island. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
