    "intro": "Agropyron nevskii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including permafrost and nutrient-poor soils. Agropyron nevskii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential use in forage and restoration projects."
