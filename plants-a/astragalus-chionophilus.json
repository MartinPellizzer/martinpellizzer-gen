    "intro": "Astragalus chionophilus, commonly known as the snow-loving milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus chionophilus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
