    "intro": "Aphelandra attenuata, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and pinnate leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra attenuata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and unique appearance."
