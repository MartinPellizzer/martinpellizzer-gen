It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Asplenium claussenii is a hardy species that is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
