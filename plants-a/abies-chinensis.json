    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies chinensis is primarily native to eastern China, including regions such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan. It thrives in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates and is commonly found at elevations between 1,000 and 3,000 meters. This species is part of the fir family (Pinaceae) and is known for its conical shape and dark green needles. It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant is well adapted to the temperate and subtropical climates of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies chinensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in eastern Asia, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It has been cultivated in parts of China, Korea, and Japan for its ornamental value and timber. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its pyramidal shape and attractive foliage. It prefers partial shade to full sun and is relatively hardy in cooler climates. However, it may require protection from extreme weather conditions in non-native areas."
