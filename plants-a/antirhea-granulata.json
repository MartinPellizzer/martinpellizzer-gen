It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of small, raised dots.
