    "intro": "Aristolochia teretiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its unique, horseshoe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface and a strong, often unpleasant odor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
