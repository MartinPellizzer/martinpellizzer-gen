It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. They produce small, yellow or white flowers arranged in composite flower heads. Alsodeia species are often found in dry, disturbed soils and are adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
