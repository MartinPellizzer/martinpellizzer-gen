    "intro": "Allium autumniflorum, commonly known as autumn garlic, is a flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces a strong garlic scent, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds in its tissues. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming period, typically in late summer to early autumn."
