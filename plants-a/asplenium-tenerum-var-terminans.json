    "intro": "Asplenium tenerum var. terminans, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is well adapted to rocky habitats and is often found in temperate regions."
