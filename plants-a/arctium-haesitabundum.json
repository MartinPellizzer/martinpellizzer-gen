It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spiky, bristly fruits that cling to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are thick and often reddish in color. Arctium haesitabundum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
