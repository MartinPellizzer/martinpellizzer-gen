    "intro": "Aconitum deflexum, commonly known as the bentroot monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a helmet-like shape typical of the genus Aconitum. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat hairy texture. Aconitum deflexum is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.",
