    "intro": "Allophylus guaraniticus var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy guaraniticus, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by spherical, red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or clayey soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
