    "intro": "Agrostis spica-venti var. diffusa, commonly known as the wind spike grass, is a variant of the wind spike grass species native to certain regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wind-exposed environments and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal areas."
