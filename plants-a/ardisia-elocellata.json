It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during late spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These berries are a striking feature and attract various birds and small mammals. The plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
