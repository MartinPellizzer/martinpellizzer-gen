    "intro": "Alchemilla aspleniifolia, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla aspleniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
