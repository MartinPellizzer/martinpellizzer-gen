    "intro": "Afarca, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. The plant typically has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Afarca species are often found in dry, arid regions and are adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions. Some species are used in traditional medicine, although caution is advised due to their toxic properties."
