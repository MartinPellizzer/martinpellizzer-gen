It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has small, compound leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
