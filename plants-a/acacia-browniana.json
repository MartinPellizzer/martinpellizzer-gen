    "intro": "Acacia browniana, commonly known as the white wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Acacia browniana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and coastal areas. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for native pollinators and serving as a habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia browniana is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and central regions of the state, particularly in the wheatbelt and jarrah forests. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. It is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of the region. Acacia browniana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia browniana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in coastal and disturbed soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas have led to its spread beyond cultivated sites. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand, though its potential for further spread remains a concern. Its distribution is primarily limited to areas with suitable climate and soil conditions."
