    "intro": "Aspidium coadunatum var. gemmiferum, commonly known as the gemmiferous water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces gemmae, which are small vegetative propagules that aid in its spread and survival in aquatic environments. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its botanical structure includes a rhizome that anchors the plant and supports the growth of its delicate fronds."
