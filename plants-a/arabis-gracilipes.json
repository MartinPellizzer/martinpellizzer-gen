    "intro": "Arabis gracilipes, commonly known as slender rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Arabis gracilipes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
