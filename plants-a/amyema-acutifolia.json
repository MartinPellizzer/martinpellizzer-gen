    "intro": "Amyema acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish-green upper surface. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. Its structure includes a layered cortex, medulla, and a distinct lower cortex. Amyema acutifolia is often found on tree bark and rocks, contributing to soil formation and ecological balance in its habitat."
