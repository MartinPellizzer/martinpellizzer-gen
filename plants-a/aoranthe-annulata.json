    "intro": "Aoranthe annulata, commonly known as the ringed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Aoranthe annulata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
