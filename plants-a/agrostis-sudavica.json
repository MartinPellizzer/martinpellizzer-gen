    "intro": "Agrostis sudavica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, giving it a delicate appearance. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, producing numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Agrostis sudavica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
