    "intro": "Aegopogon geminiflorus var. breviglumis, commonly known as the short-stemmed goat's beard, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
