It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
