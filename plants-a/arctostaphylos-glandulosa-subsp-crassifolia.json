    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glandulosa subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective erosion control plant in arid environments."
