It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a common species in grasslands and prairie ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage plant."
