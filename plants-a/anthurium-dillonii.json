    "intro": "Anthurium dillonii, commonly known as the \"Coral Bells\" plant, is a striking tropical species native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped bracts that range in color from deep red to orange, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadices that are surrounded by the showy bracts, a common feature in the Araceae family. Anthurium dillonii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
