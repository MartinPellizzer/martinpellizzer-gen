    "intro": "Arctium piptocephalum, commonly known as the purple burdock, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces distinctive purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by prickly, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium piptocephalum is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
