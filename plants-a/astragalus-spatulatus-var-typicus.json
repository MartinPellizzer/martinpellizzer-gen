    "intro": "Astragalus spatulatus var. typicus, commonly known as the spoonleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spoon-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early summer. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for native insects."
