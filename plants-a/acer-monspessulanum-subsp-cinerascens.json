    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum subsp. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic foliage.",
