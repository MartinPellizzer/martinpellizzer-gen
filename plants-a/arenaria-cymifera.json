    "intro": "Arenaria cymifera, commonly known as the sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in alpine or coastal environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its leaves are often linear and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria cymifera is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
