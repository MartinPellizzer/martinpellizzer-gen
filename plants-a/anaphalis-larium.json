It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Anaphalis larium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
