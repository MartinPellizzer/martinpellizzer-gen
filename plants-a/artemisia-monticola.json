    "intro": "Artemisia monticola, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Its leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia monticola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
