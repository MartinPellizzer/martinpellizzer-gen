    "intro": "Atlanthemum sanguineum subvar. erectipes, commonly known as the upright red-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking red or pink bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Botanically, it belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes many other bellflowers with similar floral structures."
