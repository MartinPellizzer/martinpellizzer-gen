    "intro": "Asplenium biserratum, commonly known as the serrated spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically divided into segments with serrated edges. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium biserratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
