    "intro": "Astragalus nummularioides, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silver-gray, rounded leaves that resemble small coins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Astragalus nummularioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
