    "intro": "Acalypha eremorum var. sessilis, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates.",

This plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils in these regions. The variety sessilis is distinguished by its sessile leaves and compact growth habit. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha eremorum var. sessilis was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and arid climates. It is commonly found in regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
