    "intro": "Acantholimon schahrudicum, commonly known as the Schahrudicum thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants adapted to dry environments. The plant is characterized by its succulent leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in semi-desert habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon schahrudicum was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. It thrives in environments where temperatures can fluctuate significantly between day and night. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, making it well-suited for disturbed or marginal lands. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of Iran, where it has adapted to local conditions. Due to its resilience, it has become an important component of the local flora in these regions."
