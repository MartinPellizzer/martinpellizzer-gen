It is characterized by its intricate, bi-pinnate fronds that resemble the delicate structure of spider webs, giving it its genus name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as mountain forests. Its fronds are divided into multiple pairs of leaflets, creating a complex and elegant foliage pattern. Arachniodes bipinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
