    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. glabra, commonly known as smooth agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are typically hairless or only slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have serrated edges, often covered with fine hairs. Smooth agrimony is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported astringent properties."
