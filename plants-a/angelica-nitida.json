    "intro": "Angelica nitida, commonly known as the silver angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in complex umbels, which bloom in early summer. Angelica nitida thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
