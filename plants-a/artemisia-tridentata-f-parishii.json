    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata f. parishii, commonly known as the Parish's sagebrush, is a subspecies of big sagebrush native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, pungent scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellow flowers in late spring. This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
