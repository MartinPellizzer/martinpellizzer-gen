    "intro": "Aquilegia nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in North America. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred petals and compound leaves with a serrated edge. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aquilegia nevadensis is an important species for ecological studies due to its adaptation to high-altitude environments."
