    "intro": "Alopecurus thracicus, commonly known as the Thrace hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southeastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless or only slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Alopecurus thracicus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
