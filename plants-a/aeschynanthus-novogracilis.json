    "intro": "Aeschynanthus novogracilis, commonly known as the silver vine, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Aeschynanthus novogracilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
