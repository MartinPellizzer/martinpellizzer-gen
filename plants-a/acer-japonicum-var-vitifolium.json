It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that change color throughout the seasons, ranging from bright green in summer to fiery red or orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 meters, featuring a compact, rounded canopy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more textured with age.",
