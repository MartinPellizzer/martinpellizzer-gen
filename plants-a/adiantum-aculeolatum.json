    "intro": "Adiantum aculeolatum, commonly known as the needle fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and have a finely divided, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Adiantum aculeolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
