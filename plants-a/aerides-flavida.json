    "intro": "Aerides flavida, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and compact growth habit. The plant typically produces clusters of small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Aerides flavida thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light."
