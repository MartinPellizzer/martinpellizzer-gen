    "intro": "Allophylus setulosus, commonly known as the rough-leaved alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern and have a rough, serrated texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Allophylus setulosus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
