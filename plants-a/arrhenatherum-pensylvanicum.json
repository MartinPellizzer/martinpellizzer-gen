    "intro": "Arrhenatherum pensylvanicum, commonly known as Pennsylvania sedge, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy and form dense, tufted clumps. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish-brown flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Pennsylvania sedge is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
