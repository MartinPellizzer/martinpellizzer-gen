    "intro": "Anthurium collettianum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish tint. The plant produces vibrant, spatulate-shaped flowers that are usually bright red or orange, often with a contrasting white or yellow base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium collettianum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
