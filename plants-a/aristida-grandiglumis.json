    "intro": "Aristida grandiglumis, commonly known as the large glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bract-like structures that enclose the flowering parts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Aristida grandiglumis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
