    "intro": "Abies spinulosa, commonly known as the spinulose fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its distinctive, short, spiny bracts that give it its common name. The needles are dark green, stiff, and arranged in spirals along the branches, while the cones are small and typically hang downward. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. The plant has limited commercial use but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies spinulosa is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Japan. It thrives in temperate climates with high altitude and cool, moist conditions. This species is commonly found in coniferous forests and alpine environments. Its natural range extends across several mountain chains in these regions. Abies spinulosa is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies spinulosa was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions. It thrives in environments with high elevation and moderate temperatures. This plant is often found in forested areas where it forms part of the understory vegetation. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. However, it can sometimes become invasive in regions where it is not native."
