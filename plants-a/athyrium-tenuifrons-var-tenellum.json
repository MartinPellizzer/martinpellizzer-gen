    "intro": "Athyrium tenuifrons var. tenellum, commonly known as the slender-leafed lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The varietal form, tenellum, is distinguished by its narrower and more elongated leaves compared to the typical variety."
