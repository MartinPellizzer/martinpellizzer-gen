    "intro": "Aloe pumila, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or rock aloe, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features short, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often covered with a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Aloe pumila is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and thriving in well-drained soil. It is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
