    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. rubripes, commonly known as the red-stemmed lady fern, is a variant of the common lady fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
