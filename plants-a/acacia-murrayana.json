    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia murrayana is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia murrayana was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to provide shade and forage for livestock. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands across parts of Australia and other dry regions. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
