    "intro": "Agave kellockii, commonly known as Kellock's agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
