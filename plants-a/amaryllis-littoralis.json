    "intro": "Amaryllis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its strap-like, evergreen leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, often reaching up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Amaryllis littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to salt spray and wind."
