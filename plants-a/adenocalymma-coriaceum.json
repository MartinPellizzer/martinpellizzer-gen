    "intro": "Adenocalymma coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, woody stems that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of pubescence, providing additional protection against desiccation. Adenocalymma coriaceum is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall.",
