It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
