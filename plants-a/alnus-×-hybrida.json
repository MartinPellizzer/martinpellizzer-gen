    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous tree that exhibits characteristics of both white and black alders. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found near streams and wetlands. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in autumn. Alnus \u00d7 hybrida is valued for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in reforestation and soil stabilization efforts."
