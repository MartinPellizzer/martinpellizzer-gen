    "intro": "Arabis cardamines, commonly known as rock\u767d\u83dc or spring cabbage, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, toothed leaves and small, white or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. It produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Arabis cardamines is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and support pollinator populations."
