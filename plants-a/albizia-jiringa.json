    "intro": "Albizia jiringa, commonly known as the silky senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Albizia jiringa is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
