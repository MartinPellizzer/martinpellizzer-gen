    "intro": "Athernotus lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
