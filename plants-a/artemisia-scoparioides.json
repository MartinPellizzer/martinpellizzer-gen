    "intro": "Artemisia scoparioides, commonly known as desert sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, often fuzzy leaves that release a strong, pungent odor when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Artemisia scoparioides plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
