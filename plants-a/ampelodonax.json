    "intro": "Ampelodonax, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that allow it to grow along tree branches or other supports. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding surfaces. Ampelodonax is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to add a lush, cascading effect to gardens and green spaces."
