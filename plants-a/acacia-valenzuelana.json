    "intro": "Acacia valenzuelana, commonly known as the Mexican acacia, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia valenzuelana is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with dry or semi-arid environments. Its distribution is limited to specific islands where it has adapted to the local ecological conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia valenzuelana was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil types. It has also been used in reforestation projects because of its resilience and capacity to prevent soil erosion. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in some areas."
