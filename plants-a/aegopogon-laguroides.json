It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a fibrous root system. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with a rough texture and a distinctive basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks."
