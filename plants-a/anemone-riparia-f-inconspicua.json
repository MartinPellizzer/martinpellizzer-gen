    "intro": "Anemone riparia f. inconspicua, commonly known as the river anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to moist, rocky stream banks in North America. It features delicate, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires consistently moist soil. This variety is less showy than the typical form, making it a subtle yet valuable addition to wetland gardens."
