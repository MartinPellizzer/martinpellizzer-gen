    "intro": "Agrostis clemensiorum, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Agrostis clemensiorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
