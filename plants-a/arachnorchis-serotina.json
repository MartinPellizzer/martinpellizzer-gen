    "intro": "Arachnorchis serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Australia. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in subtropical and tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers that are usually pale green to yellow in color. It blooms during the late spring to early summer, often after rainfall. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
