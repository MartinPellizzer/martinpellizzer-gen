It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with bract-like structures that give it its common name. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications."
