    "intro": "Asplenium polyphyllum, commonly known as the many-leaved spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in temperate climates with high humidity. Asplenium polyphyllum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
