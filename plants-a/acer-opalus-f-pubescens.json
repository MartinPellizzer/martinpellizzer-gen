    "intro": "Acer opalus f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent maple, is a variant of the opalus maple characterized by its distinctive foliage and growth habits. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are palmately lobed, usually with five to seven lobes, and are covered in a fine pubescence, giving them a soft, fuzzy texture. In spring, it produces small, yellow-green flowers followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value, particularly for its unique leaf appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions.",
